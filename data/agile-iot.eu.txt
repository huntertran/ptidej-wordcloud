Modularity & Adaptability
AGILE builds a modular and adaptive gateway for IoT devices. Modularity at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired IoT networking technologies (e.g. KNX, ZWave, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, etc.) and allows fast prototyping of IoT solutions for various domains (e.g. home automation, environment monitoring, wearables, etc.). At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally. The AGILE software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps are recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.

Open Source
All AGILE software modules will be delivered as 100% Open Source, with the majority of them becoming part of a new Eclipse Foundation IoT Project. The objective is to provide IoT developers and communities with software components for effective and agile IoT prototyping, and at the same time to establish a community of users and developers, maximizing the adoption of the AGILE Project.
Diverse Pilots
AGILE will run five pilots by QuantifiedSelf from wearables for self-tracking, and open air crop and livestock monitoring using drones, to smart retail solutions for enhanced shopping experiences. These pilots will both demonstrate the applicability of the hardware and software in managing IoT devices and creating applications and sharing data, and will set the foundations for further commercial exploitation of the Project and innovations.
An IoT Testbed
AGILE will become part of the existing IoT-Lab infrastructure in France managed by INRIA. With more than 2500 sensors deployed in 5 locations, AGILE users will have the opportunity to evaluate their IoT applications in real environments, collect and store sensor data, and interact with real devices.

Still not convinced? What if we told you that the most ambitious makers will also have the opportunity to create and run their own IoT apps through our visual environment and share them with the rest of our community!?
If you are getting started in the IoT world, you may think that this is not for you, since everything seems technical and complicated. Don’t worry, AGILE software can be auto-configured and adapted based on the hardware so that the entire setup is performed automatically for you! Forget about wiring, make it fast and easy, make it AGILE.
Launch Open Call 2:
February 1, 2018
This deliverable introduces the concept of AGILE gateway and presents the preliminary hardware architecture of the makers and industrial versions of the gateway. The deliverable illustrates the methodology adopted for the design of the gateway, reports the results of the requirements analysis performed in WP1 and WP8 and provides the preliminary specifications of AGILE gateways.

Why Crowdfunding?
The makers’ world is constantly moving, with various contributors, new creations, new development technologies, and in some cases, smarter devices that improve our daily lives. Crowdfunding campaigns help bring these ideas to life. They are created to help those without enough resources to make their ideas progress and make them successful. This isn’t always an easy path. Reaching an overwhelming victory depends solely on the supporters.

D2.1 Core requirements specification and IoT protocol integration
This report forms part of the contractual deliverables of the AGILE H2020 EC-funded project. It documents the results from the analysis of available IoT Standards and protocols (for IoT and Machine-to-Machine communication) that will be integrated within AGILE for maximising the connected device support and interoperability. Support of the selected protocols (for integration in various layers such as the operating system, device management and the userspace) is assessed for features such as device discovery, communication and, additionally, utilisation of external protocols (e.g. for messaging).

In addition, the deliverable illustrates a process for auto-configuring hardware modules within the gateway, focusing on the configuration steps required during the deployment of the gateway and on the resource optimisation at runtime. This will allow the AGILE gateway to be autoconfigured based on the application context and user preferences. A preliminary mechanism to implement the configurator service is documented herein. A more detailed documentation of the configuration, will be presented in deliverable D2.2 (initial version of Gateway Selfconfiguration, IoT Device discovery & Remote gateway management).

D5.3 Secure Data Sharing
Data sharing is a key element of IoT environments; however, security and privacy concerns can diminish the potential of certain applications as users are reluctant to give data to third parties unconditionally. This deliverable describes how the AGILE security framework supports data sharing mechanisms while offering security assurances to users storing information on the gateway or sharing it with external systems.

Invitation Pitch and communication:
April
First of all we explain enforcement mechanisms applied within the gateway. Those include enforcement points to ensure authorised access to container APIs, encryption of data stored within the gateway, and a policy decision point that can be used from applications running within or outside of the gateway.
Afterward, we explain mechanisms supporting use cases when data needs to be sent or received to/from external systems. For instance, AGILE offers a one-time token mechanism allowing external devices to authenticate in a lightweight manner towards the gateway. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in resource constrained devices, we implemented the client-side mechanism to generate tokens on RIOT (an OS for the IoT).
With regard to outsourcing data to external systems, we developed an SQL connector. This connector allows AGILE users to apply policies based on tables and actions performed on them when an application executes database queries. More importantly, when used in combination with CryptDB (an existing encrypted database), this connector can be used to offload data storage and querying computational resources to more powerful servers, yet without letting the external service to see the data in plain text. This is possible because information is encrypted before it is shared with external services.

To offer a wide range of integration possibilities, we do not only describe how to interact with a structured query language in a secure manner; on the contrary, we also include an approach that enables developers to apply policies on any kind of data they need to process. To this end, we created a sample application that is easily extensible and documents how to use the policy decision points from AGILE in different scenarios. These scenarios range from operating on an in-memory array of objects to obtaining information from external HTTP endpoints, e.g. github API, and applying policies on it.

This deliverable describes how usage control and monitoring is achieved through the implementation of the AGILE security architecture. To this end, the security architecture is placed in the big picture of the AGILE project, and the location of the enforcement points required to achieve proper access and usage control of the data is covered herein. Additionally, this report illustrates how monitoring of actions to track provenance of data access gives insights to security-aware users on how systems interacting with the gateway APIs act on their behalf and access their data.
From the technical perspective, the policy language used by AGILE and the evaluation of the security policies with their dimensions are discussed. Later sections describe how the desired role-based access control model presented in earlier deliverables has been implemented on top of our generic attribute-based security architecture. More importantly, this document clarifies how the role-based access control currently configured by default for the gateway is realised by explaining entity definitions and their policies. The aforementioned role-based access control mechanisms serve as the foundation to apply policies capable of ensuring proper usage control on the gateway’s data. This takes place through a flexible policy framework implemented based on usage lock policies.

D6.4 Innovation and Exploitation Report 1
The goal of this deliverable is to provide a baseline for the exploitation management of AGILE. In this first iteration, the focus is on the innovation potential the individual project partners see for AGILE as an opportunity to explore alternative exploitation and monetization paths, or to enhance existing ones. In order to achieve a structured overview, a business model validation tool is introduced and applied to each participating partner in AGILE. The tool identifies each partners’ envisaged customer segments, their common need, the value promise of the solution, the technical aspects involved, the value network of stakeholders, the identifiable competition and the potential financial model. Each of these aspects is briefly explained with the goal of providing a starting point for later iterations of this deliverable.

The initial conclusions show that various partners in the project have compatible customer segments and value propositions that revolve around the AGILE solution. This compatibility is important, as it will allow individual partners to exploit results from the project in their respective businesses: it is clear that the integrated solution that AGILE promises to be will be exploitable as such, but at the same time it will allow several partners to build on and exploit the results even without a further commercialised, integrated platform.

The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the

D6.5 Innovation and Exploitation Planning and Report
The goal of this deliverable is to provide an additional layer for the exploitation management of AGILE and enable exploitation planning. In this second iteration, the focus is put on the exploitation opportunities for each pilot conducted within AGILE to explore avenues for monetization and go-to-market strategies. To build up on the Business Modelling assessment from the first iteration of this deliverable, a stakeholder-based business modelling approach was chosen to define the business model scenarios of the single pilots as archetypes for AGILE exploitation possibilities. The approach defines the stakeholder environment in which the AGILE-driven solutions of the pilots are integrated and then defines which stakeholders could provide revenue to make the solution sustainable and which users would have to cooperate in order for the pilot-specific business models to be sustainable a the targeted market.
The business model solutions were drafted collaboratively in a workshop on the consortium meeting in Q1 2017 and refined afterwards. The initial conclusions from the business modelling exercise and following research show that each pilot has solid exploitation options and a variety of stakeholder that are likely to provide a sustainable inflow of revenue. The diversity of the pilot business models shows how flexibly AGILE can be deployed, without being limited to a specific application or a specific domain.

The aim of this deliverable is to present the results from the analysis of requirements and the design specifications providing a first insight on the utilization and validation of the AGILE solution in the project’s pilots. The cornerstone for the requirements elicitation and the pilots definition has been the early engagement of all the project stakeholders into the pilots execution. The deliverable highlights the initial inputs on pilots and technical deals concerning the components definition and pilot preparation as part of the overall AGILE pilots execution and evaluation methodology.

We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.

Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.
The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.
In the future we are keen to continue to use Agile-BLE in order to integrate additional sensors. In addition, once the Agile hub becomes LoRaWAN-enabled we will be very keen to explore the possibility of using Agile hub.

. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.

monitoring platform allows the supply chain stakeholders of bottled wine to monitor the most critical parameters affecting wine quality during its storage and transportation. Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.

In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).
The results of the ISTMOS-AGILE integration have been evaluated through a pilot case study in collaboration with two large Greek wineries.
Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.
