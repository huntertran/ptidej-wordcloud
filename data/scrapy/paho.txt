For Constrained Networks
IoT systems need to deal with frequent network disruption and intermittent, slow, or poor quality networks. Minimal data costs are crucial on networks with millions and billons of connected devices.
Devices and Embedded Platforms
Devices and edge-of-network servers often have very limited processing resources available. Paho understands small footprint clients and corresponding server support.

MQTT C Client for Posix and Windows
The Paho MQTT C Client is a fully featured MQTT client written in ANSI standard C. C was chosen rather than C++ to maximize portability. A
C++ API
over this library is also available in Paho.
In fact there are two C APIs. "Synchronous" and "asynchronous" for which the API calls start with MQTTClient and MQTTAsync respectively. The synchronous API is intended to be simpler and more helpful. To this end, some of the calls will block until the operation has completed, which makes programming easier. In contrast, only one call blocks in the asynchronous API - waitForCompletion. Notifications of results are made by callbacks which makes the API suitable for use in environments where the application is not the main thread of control.

Embedded MQTT C/C++ Client Libraries
The "full" Paho MQTT C client library was written with Linux and Windows in mind. It assumes the existence of Posix or Windows libraries for networking (sockets), threads and memory allocation. The embedded libraries are intended to have these characteristics:
use very limited resources - pick and choose the components needed
not reliant on any particular libraries for networking, threading or memory management
ANSI standard C for maximum portability, at the lowest level
optional higher layer(s) in C and/or C++.
Features
The libraries can be used on desktop operating systems, but are primarily aimed for environments such as

MQTTPacket
This is the lowest level library, the simplest and smallest, but hardest to use. It simply deals with serialization and deserialization of MQTT packets. Serialization means taking application data and converting it to a form ready for sending across the network. Deserialization means taking the data read from the network and extracting the data.

Using Eclipse Paho's MQTT on BeagleBone Black and Raspberry Pi
by Dj Walker-Morgan
How would you connect the information from a temperature sensor on a BeagleBone Black to an LED display on a Raspberry Pi and would your solution scale up to many sensors and displays? In this article we’ll show how MQTT and the
Eclipse Paho project
can let you answer that challenge.
The arrival of the Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBone Black has heralded a time when a small Linux-powered board can easily, and economically, make sense as a complex sensor or display in the Internet of Things. It also means that developers can end up using web technology that's not suited to the Internet of Things, where the connections may only be occasionally available and as reliable as a cellphone call and where devices need to sip power while sending and receiving information.

Using the Eclipse Paho JavaScript Client
Downloading
A zip file containing the full and a minified version the Javascript client can be downloaded from the
Paho downloads page
Alternatively the Javascript client can be downloaded directly from the projects git repository:
Linux
The C++ client is built for Linux/Unix/Mac with CMake, and uses g++ or clang++ as the compiler. Because it requires a compliant C++11 compiler, only GCC 4.8.1 or clang 3.6 or later are supported. See the
GitHub page
for complete build instructions.
Windows
For Windows, CMake is used to generate a solution file for Visual Studio. Due to the C++11 requirement, the earliest version that can be used with the library is Visual Studio 2015. See the
GitHub page
for complete build instructions.
Documentation
Reference documentation is
online
.
Getting Started
These C++ clients connect to a broker using a TCP/IP connection using Posix or Windows networking, threading and memory allocation calls. They cannot be used with other networking APIs. For that, look at the Embdedded C/C++ client.
Here is a simple example of publishing with the C++ client synchronous API:

MQTT Conformance/Interoperability Testing
The aim of this project is to create a means by which it is easy to test both MQTT servers and client libraries, to ensure
they conform to the
MQTT 3.1.1 standard
and hence they can interoperate with each other, with the minimum of misunderstandings.
The test material is all written in Python version 3 (Python 2.x is not sufficient). The component of the test material are:
an MQTT conformance statements spreadsheet, extracted from the standard
a test broker, against which client tests can be run
a test client, for very basic testing of MQTT server 3.1.1 support
a model-based testing package, which will be used to generate the full tests, in due course

Graphical MQTT Client Tools
Here are the GUI tools currently available in Paho.
RCP application. Can run standalone or in the Eclipse IDE.
Eclipse plugin. Not all the features of the Java API are included.
Java Swing application (IA92 replacement). Not all the current features of the Java API are included
MQTT RCP Application
It has the following features:
Able to run the tool as a standalone RCP application or install it into existing Eclipse IDE as an Eclipse plugin.
Able to connect to multiple MQTT servers with multiple connections, and the connections are saved for later use.
Publish message, subscribe and unsubscribe multiple topics at one time.
Display history events: connect, disconnect, publish, subscribe, received messages and last received messages etc.
General options: keepAlive, connection timeout, username & password and persistence etc.
SSL settings: keystore and truststore.
High availability options: support multiple server URIs.
Last will and Testament options.
Relative bigger in size comparing to Swing based tool, around 25MB.
This is where
MQTT
comes in to take on these connectivity problems and open up a whole realm of possibilities for developers to create smarter, more connected applications. MQTT is a system, and a network protocol, for broadcasting and listening for information over networks. Designed as a complement to enterprise messaging systems, MQTT is a lightweight publish and subscribe protocol. The idea with what was called at the time, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, to fill the gap between the numerous devices and applications that could produce data and the wider world of data consumers. As these devices were typically outside of the corporate network the protocol needed to be resilient to network issues. Now, known just as MQTT (with no acronym), the most recent version, MQTT 3.1, is being used as OASIS’s standard for messaging for the internet of things, further extending MQTT’s industry support and alongside that work, the Eclipse Foundation’s M2M project is curating open source versions of components for MQTT-based systems.
In practice, MQTT lets developers write applications which publish their data as messages to the MQTT network without worrying themselves with how other applications will receive that data. The messages are published to topics, strings which can resemble filesystem paths, like “/rooms/a1/environment/temperature” or “/raspberrypi/status” or “/beaglebone/running/process”. This message data – the payload – is most typically small packets, but MQTT is flexible enough to allow it to be as much as 256MB. The MQTT overhead itself is as little as two bytes over the payload and topic and the load on clients is small as the broker takes over the heavier lifting of redistributing messages.
Other developers can write applications that select which topics, or wildcard-based ranges of topics they will then receive messages for. These are the subscribers. There’s nothing to stop a client being both a publisher and a subscriber though. Bringing the two sides together and providing the glue of an MQTT network are the MQTT brokers. These are applications built to route, or retain, messages between publishing and subscribing clients. Getting building – a publishing sensor
These concepts are best demonstrated so let’s start building our temperature sensor. We’re doing this on the BeagleBone Black. It’s a pretty self-contained device so you just need to add power and network and ssh to “root@beaglebone.local” to log into one fresh out of the box. You can, of course, attach a monitor and use a GUI on the BeagleBone Black - or the Raspberry Pi, which we will come to later - but here we are keeping hardware and software tooling requirements to a minimum so we can focus on MQTT.
To attach a temperature sensor to a BeagleBone Black, we have followed the
tutorial
created by Simon Monk for the AdaFruit Learning System. The electronics are very simple and connect the three pins of a TMP36 temperature sensor to an analogue input on the BeagleBone Black. The software side involves
installing and using an AdaFruit library
to read the value and we end up running a Python program similar to this:
So now we have a source of temperature data. Now we can MQTT enable this program. Our first stop is the Eclipse Paho project where MQTT client libraries for various languages have been assembled. There you can find the Paho Python library, but as it is yet to be formally packaged and released, we will need to build it. To build it for the BeagleBone Black’s Angstrom Linux distribution we first need to download the source code using git:
This will create a copy of the repository in the directory “org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.python”. If we now move into that directory we can get on with building the code:
With the Paho MQTT library built, we can return to our Python code and start adding the basic elements. The first thing to do is to import the library:

Getting Started
A test or "model" MQTT server is in the package mqtt/broker. You can run it with the command:
and if running successfully, you will see this:
To test an MQTT Client Library, start the test broker, as described above. Run your test suite against this broker. Note the coverage achieved when you stop the broker. Try and get more coverage!
The client_test.py program, as described above, is a good basis for the sort of coverage that ought to be achieved. With client libraries that ensure the data that is sent to the server consists of well-formed MQTT packets, the tests are likely hit the good paths in the broker rather than the exceptions. So you don't need to worry if your exception coverage is low or non-existent.
To test an MQTT Server, run:
as a first test. If hostname:port are not specified, localhost:1883 is assumed.

It has the following features:

Publish message, subscribe and unsubscribe
Display history events: connect, disconnect, publish, subscribe, received messages etc.
General options: keepAlive, connection timeout, and persistence etc.
Now we can set up the client connection to the broker:
Here we create our client and tell it to connect to m2m.eclipse.org. That’s the Eclipse public sandbox for M2M developers which has been created to let people experiment with M2M without setting up their own broker. That said, you can easily set up a broker with Mosquitto (http://mosquitto.org/), the open source dedicated MQTT broker, if you wish. Other brokers are available, but it’s worth noting that Mosquitto is also becoming an Eclipse M2M project.
The connection to the broker is made over port 1883 and the connection will be kept alive with a 60 second ping in the absence of any other activity. The code also starts up a thread to handle incoming messages from the broker with the loop_start method. We are now almost ready to send messages to the broker, but before we do that, we need come up with a topic. We shall start with a root name of “bbbexample” for our topics, then have a subtopic “tmp36” to represent the temperature sensor and two sub-subtopics “mv” and “c” to represent the milli-volt and centigrade readings from that sensor. This will give us two absolute topics “bbbexample/tmp36/mv” and “bbbexample/tmp36/c”. Remember though, that if you are working in a shared sandbox like m2m.eclipse.org, you will want to change “bbbexample” to something unique to you (and the broker) or risk having your readings overwritten by another person.
With topics selected, once we’ve printed the millivolt and centigrade temperature readings we can add:
Formatting the values to two decimal places for tidiness. This gives us our complete program:
And running that should publish values to the Eclipse sandbox every second. To check this is happening without writing a client, we can make use of one feature of the Eclipse M2M sandbox, the
Eclipse MQTT Bridge
(at eclipse.mqttbridge.com), which presents the contents of a sandbox in easily consumable web formats. By using the curl utility, it is possible to obtain the value from the last message passed through the broker like so:
We shall return to the BeagleBone Black and the Python client later; the next stop for us is creating a client that will use that temperature data.
The listening Pi
Moving on to the Raspberry Pi, we are going to use Java rather than Python, but the language and libraries used are generally interchangeable between the platforms. The various MQTT APIs typically use callbacks to notify applications when an event has occurred. When we subscribe to messages from a topic and a message subsequently arrives, an appropriate callback is invoked. In Java the MQTT callbacks are encapsulated in an interface called MqttCallback. In our code, we’ll need to implement that interface:
We’ve also declared an MqttClient variable, an empty constructor and a main method for our PahoMqttSubscribe class. The doDemo method will contain most of the code. In that method we need to create a connection to the Eclipse sandbox.
The program is now ready to subscribe to a topic. In the Python code, we were publishing the centigrade temperature to bbbexample/tmp36/c, so let’s subscribe to that:

Building from source
There are two active branches on the Paho Java git repository,
master
which is used to produce stable releases, and
develop
where active development is carried out. By default cloning the git repository will download the
master
branch, to build from
develop
make sure you switch to the remote branch:
git checkout -b develop remotes/origin/develop
To then build the library run the following maven command:
mvn package -DskipTests
This will build the client library without running the tests. The jars for the library, source and javadoc can be found in the
org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3/target
directory.

And we can continue doing whatever processing we want after… in the example, we’ll just idly wait calling Thread.sleep. There’s only one thing missing - we haven’t implemented the methods needed by MqttCallback, and most importantly, the messageArrived callback. This delivers the topic the message has been sent to and the message itself. For now, the code can just print the topic and the message payload:
These aren’t the only callbacks needed though, so the code will need to declare the others, even if they only do nothing:
The connectionLost callback allows an application to manage reconnection to the broker, while the deliveryComplete callback is called when a message is delivered to the broker. There are actually two APIs available in Java for MQTT. One is a fully non-blocking API which uses a number of token mechanisms to track all progress. The other is the API we are using here which is a wrapper around the non-blocking API and generally blocks on calls, though callback methods like deliveryComplete offer a preview of the control of the non-blocking API.
We now have our complete code:
All we have to do is compile and run it and for that we’ll need a JDK. It used to be the case that you had to download a JDK for the Raspberry Pi’s Linux, but now the Pi’s Raspbian distribution comes with Oracle’s JDK as standard, so to keep it simple (and up to date) it is best to go to the RaspberryPi.org downloads page to get and install the latest version of Raspbian. For the Java version of the Paho MQTT libraries, we could use Maven to install it, but as we are working with minimal tooling, we can simply retrieve the jar file from the Eclipse Paho release repository with this command:
With the library downloaded and in the same directory, we can compile and run our application like so:
If the BeagleBone sensor is still running, the program should start printing the temperature data as it is received.
Pi Lumination
It’s at this point we take a brief digression into how to make these results turn up in the form of LEDs being illuminated. It is, of course, perfectly reasonable to take the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi and wire them, with breadboard and jumper cables, to LEDs. But, we are more interested in getting some quick illumination so have opted for the
BerryClip
, a small add-on board kit with gives us 6 LEDs, a button and a buzzer in one kit.
Controlling the BerryClip’s LEDs from Java can be accomplished by use of the
Pi4J library
. This is a Java wrapper around the WiringPi library and gives extensive access to the Pi’s GPIO controller and pins. There is one caveat, programs using Pi4J have to be run as root. Pi4J is packaged as a .deb file and can be installed with the commands:

Getting Started
The included code below is a very basic sample that connects to a server using WebSockets and subscribes to the topic
World
, once subscribed, it then publishes the message
Hello
to that topic. Any messages that come into the subscribed topic will be printed to the Javascript console.
This requires the use of a broker that supports WebSockets natively, or the use of a gateway that can forward between WebSockets and TCP.

Now, the temperature sensor on the BeagleBone Black will be reflected in the LEDs. If you want to test that, try touching the temperature sensor on the BeagleBone.
Going deeper with MQTT
So far, we’ve used MQTT at its very basic level. Despite this, we have already built a system that can handle multiple displays without modification as each display client just subscribes to the temperature updates. And by changing the topic for each sensor, we can publish data from any number of sensors and come up with more complex, rich displays.
But there are some things you may notice with our basic setup. We’ll look at some of them now and how MQTT already has solutions for them.
More topics
: Our Raspberry Pi display only subscribes to a single topic for its data. When publishing, you have to use “absolute” topics, but when subscribing it is possible to use wildcard characters to define a range of topics we want the code to listen to. The wildcard characters for MQTT topics are “#” and “+”. A “#” in the topic means, in the implied topic hierarchy, all topics at this level and their children, while a “+” limits it to the single immediate level. So, if we wanted to subscribe to all the messages from the temperature sensor, we could change
to
Which would mean that messages for both “bbbexample/tmp36/mv” and “bbbexample/tmp36/c” would arrive at the messageArrived method. It would be up to the code to distinguish between the topics and decide what action it wants to take. Other examples of topic subscriptions would be “bbbexample/#”, which would match any message sent to a subtopic of “bbbexample” and “bbbexample/+/c” which would match messages to any immediate child of “bbbexample” which had an immediate child “c”.
Retention
: If you have built this project and started the display client before starting the BeagleBone’s Python code, you will notice that nothing happens at the display client until the Python code is started and starts emitting messages. This is fine for many applications, but where clients may be connecting at any point they may require the last message’s values so they can process them. MQTT brokers are cable of retaining messages for late arriving clients; all a client has to do is ask when posting the message. Changing the sensor client’s publish lines to do so simply means setting a parameter retain to be true:

Getting the message through
: Because there are different levels of assurance needed for different kinds of messages, MQTT supports three levels of quality of service. These QoS settings can be set when publishing a message or when subscribing to a topic. The lowest and quickest level, 0, is the “fire and forget” mode where messages are sent and no attempt is made to acknowledge their reception. QoS 1 is the usual default setting where messages are sent, and re-sent, until there’s at least one acknowledgement. It’s slower than “fire and forget” but gives some assurance the message has got through, though the downside is that multiple copies of the message may be received. QoS 2 is the slowest of the settings as it goes through a complete two-stage process of acknowledgement, which ensures that one, and only one, copy of a message is delivered.
Losing the connection
: When a client goes “off air” abnormally, it is normally hard for other clients to detect that anomaly. With MQTT, this is easier thanks to what are called wills. A will is a topic and a message payload that a client can lodge with the broker with the implicit instruction “in the event that you can’t get in touch with me and I haven’t cleanly disconnected, deliver this message for me”. The various Paho MQTT APIs have different ways of setting this; in Python, a setWill method on the MQTT connection is used, while in the Java API, the will is part of a collection of options the developer can set in MqttConnectionOptions, an instance of which can be passed to the connect method.
Recovering the connection
: With those quality of service settings, the client has to be able to pick up the pieces when it’s been disconnected and is reconnecting. There’s a pair of elements to this in MQTT. Firstly there is a clean flag that is usually set by default. This tells the client and server to start afresh every time they connect. If the clean flag is set to false, it is then the second element comes into play. This is the client ID, which we mentioned previously while setting to a different value each time, can also be set to a fixed (or deterministically generated) string. This changes how the broker and client connect. When a client with the same client ID as its previous connection connects to the server and the clean flag is false, the broker and client will work to ensure the new session starts from where the old one left off. To help in this, client libraries implement various forms of persistence for their connections so they can figure out what they were in the process of sending. Depending on the use case, this means that you can create anything from a “fire and forget” stateless stats-gathering network to a network-resilient, assured-delivery platform with MQTT.
Securing the connection: For simplicity, we’ve been using un-authenticated and un-encrypted connections to the MQTT broker so anyone could have found out what the temperature was. MQTT does, though, support both authentication and SSL-encrypted connections for when the data is more mission critical than the temperature of your office (or fingers).
Further experiments
In the
GitHub repository for this article
at
https://github.com/codepope/talking-small
, there’s an extended example of the code which sends a test message from the Raspberry Pi when the BerryClip’s button is pressed and a version of the Python code for the BeagleBone which picks up that test message.
If you want to attach a temperature sensor to your Raspberry Pi, then you can use the TMP36 sensor, but you’ll also need an analog to digital converter like the MCP3008 as the Pi doesn’t have any analog pins. Instructions on the hardware can be found in another project from the

Background
We now have the ability to measure, sense and monitor nearly anything in the physical world. Rapid advances in embedded platforms and wireless connectivity are driving growth of M2M (Machine-to-Machine) technology and the many industries it serves. By 2020, the number of connected physical world devices is expected to be in the range of 50 billion, fueled by a 1000x increase in wireless broadband traffic. These factors are forming a significant industry shift that will not be limited to device connectivity.
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) solutions such as industrial control, smart buildings, asset tracking, traffic control and healthcare monitoring, are an essential and integral part of nearly all industry, enterprise and daily life. Inherent to M2M is the need to connect objects in the physical world, via sensors, actuators and other devices, into monitoring, control, business, and consumer software systems, often over constrained wireless networks. Advances in wireless, embedded, internet and mobile technologies are now creating all manner of new objects that can sense, control and connect. Such smart objects not only create new M2M opportunities, but also expand the availability of device connectivity to Web and Enterprise IT developers. Whether looked at as an Internet of Things or a Smarter Planet, people, systems and objects will increasingly need to communicate and interact with each other in ways that today, cannot yet be entirely anticipated.
While smart objects and physical world systems are often integrated with Enterprise and Web middleware today, it is often done using proprietary integration models and combinations of a prolific number of custom protocols and industry standards.
In most established M2M implementations of connected devices, the data producers and data consumers are programmed to interact in strict and well defined ways. For example, in a smart city, sensor-based systems can alert operators of a broken water main and report the extent of flooding in streets and subways. Well designed open messaging technology would enable solutions well beyond this, allowing public and private transit systems for example, to monitor these critical alerts, adjusting their routes and even notifying commuters and customers of alternative routes, transportation, lodging and meals. Social networks could subscribe, allowing residents and commuters to interact, adapt and even provide feedback and status to the city.
In an example like this, the M2M system monitoring the water main would not, in its original design, have been able to communicate or interact with the traffic systems or residents. The next generation of messaging technology will support an architecture that enables a more spontaneous reuse and rerouting of data with minimal programming or reconfiguration of legacy monitoring systems.
Open source messaging components are needed that can cater to the serendipitous nature of data and events from the physical world around us, accelerating and opening new markets. These components will of course have to support the open messaging models prevalent on the Web. They will have to meet high volume, low latency transaction requirements expected by Enterprise IT. At the same time, they will have to work equally well across the constrained networks and embedded platforms that are inherent to physical world of machine-to-machine systems. This will enable a paradigm shift from legacy point-to-point protocols and the limitations of protocols like SOAP or HTTP into more loosely coupled yet determinable models. It will bridge the SOA, REST, Pub/Sub and other middleware architectures already well understood by Web 2.0 and Enterprise IT shops today, with the embedded and wireless device architectures inherent to M2M.
Scope
The scope of the Paho project is to provide open source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols that support current and emerging requirements of M2M integration with Web and Enterprise middleware and applications. It will include client implementations for use on embedded platforms along with corresponding server support as determined by the community.
In order for M2M device and client developers to integrate, develop and test messaging components end-to-end, Paho will address the development of frameworks and sample code needed to support testing and development of end-to-end device connectivity with a server. The project will make these available in an Eclipse M2M sever “sandbox”, as recommended by the Eclipse M2M Industry Working Group.
The Paho project scope includes the development of tooling that will support effective use, integration and testing of the messaging components.

Description
Architectural requirements for network, client and server support will be developed with the Eclipse Machine-to-Machine Industry Working Group and will include, but are not necessarily limited to:
Bi-directional messaging that can handle both signals and commands from devices, as well as supporting the provisioning and configuration of physical world systems. Bi-directional messaging also enables an important characteristic of the next generation of M2M solutions: the ability to configure or move processing closer to the physical world systems as needed, in support of changing business requirements and the constant reshaping of the Web.
Determinable delivery of messages to and from sensors, actuators, and other resource constrained devices connected by intermittent or constrained networks.
Provide loose coupling in highly dynamic system environments where large volumes of physical word events and messages that need to be made available to the Enterprise, Web, and other consumers in ways that may not always be anticipated. This should include time, space and synchronization decoupling that will avoid unnecessarily tight binding between systems.
Constrained platforms: Instrumentation of the physical world must be supported in an extremely fragmented space where technologies, platforms and network choices are driven by very diverse equations of cost, technology and physical constraints.
Why Eclipse?
Eclipse has long had a focus on open tooling, runtimes, frameworks, standards and software architecture. The Eclipse Foundation has initiated an M2M Industry Working Group, recognizing the importance of growing and scaling device connectivity solutions needed to realize new business opportunities and keep markets open. Eclipse has a large and diverse membership, an established industry presence, and a proven track record on technology projects. The industry working group will provide a forum for discussing the broad topics of machine-to-machine communications while the Paho open source project will make implementations of advanced messaging technology readily available to M2M, Web and Enterprise customers, working to improve adoption.
The Paho project will have relationships with Equinox and other Eclipse projects, including the Koneki project and other tooling projects used by embedded, enterprise and Web developers.
Initial Contribution
The initial code contribution to Paho will include Java and C client-side implementations the
MQTT protocol
, contributed by IBM. MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol designed for mobile and remote devices, wireless connectivity, and dealing with lossy, constrained and/or intermittent network characteristics.

Getting Started
The client can connect to a broker using TCP, TLS or a WebSocket connection. Ensure the broker you're using supports the connection type you wish to use.
The type of connection required is specified by the scheme of the connection URL set in the ClientOptions struct, for example:
tcp://mqtt.eclipse.org:1883
- connect to mqtt.eclipse.org on port 1883 using plain TCP
ws://mqtt.eclipse.org:1883
- connect to mqtt.eclipse.org on port 1883 using WebSockets
tls://mqtt.eclipse.org:8883
- connect to mqtt.eclipse.org on port 8883 using TLS (ssl:// and tcps:// are synonyms for tls://)

There is always a temptation when faced with a problem such as "This application needs to just send a value to another server" to reduce it to something as simple as opening a socket and sending a value. But that simple proposition soon falls apart in production. Apart from having to write the server end of the system, the developer then has to cope with the fact that networks are not 100% reliable and the wireless and mobile networks that surround us are unreliable by design and there'll most likely need to be access control and encryption.

This environment drives the need for any protocol's implementation to be lightweight in terms of code footprint and system load, while taking care of that variable reliability connection problem.

MQTT was originally created by IBM's Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper of Arcom (taken over later by Eurotech) as a complement to enterprise messaging systems so that a wealth of data outside the enterprise could be safely and easily brought inside the enterprise. MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging system that allows clients to publish messages without concerning themselves about their eventual destination; messages are sent to an MQTT broker where they may be retained. The messages' payloads are just a sequence of bytes, up to 256MB, with no requirements placed on the format of those payloads and with the MQTT protocol usually adding a fixed header of two bytes to most messages.
Other clients can subscribe to these messages and get updated by the broker when new messages arrive. To allow for the variety of possible situations where MQTT can be put to use, it lets clients and brokers set a "Quality of Service" on a per-message basis from "fire and forget" to "confirmed delivery". MQTT also has a very light API, with all of five protocol methods, making it easy to learn and recall, but there's also support for SSL-encrypted connections and username/password authentication for clients to brokers.
Since making its debut, MQTT has proved itself in production scenarios. As well as standalone MQTT brokers, it has also been integrated into other message queuing brokers such as ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ, providing a bridge into the enterprise network. The most recent version of the specification
MQTT 3.1
is being used as the basis for an OASIS standard for messaging telemetry, a basis that’s not expected to vary much, if at all, from the MQTT specification in order to maintain compatibility.

Eclipse Paho
project is part of the
Eclipse Foundation's M2M mission
to provide high quality implementations of M2M libraries and tools. Under the Paho banner, open source client libraries for MQTT are being curated and developed; there are already MQTT C and Java libraries with Lua, Python, C++ and JavaScript at various stages of development. In this article we'll be showing how to use the Paho Java MQTT libraries to publish and subscribe.
Diving deeper into MQTT
To start thinking about MQTT in code, here's the simplest use of the MQTT API:
In this snippet, we create a client connection to an MQTT broker running on the local host, over TCP to port 1883 (the default port for MQTT). Clients need to have an identifier that is unique for all clients connecting to the broker – in this case we give the client an id of
pahomqttpublish1
. We then tell the client to connect. Now we can create an
MqttMessage
and we set its payload to a simple string. Notice that we convert the string to bytes as setPayload only takes an array of bytes. We're relying on the default settings for
MqttMessage
to set the various other parameters. Next, we publish the message and it's here we need to introduce topics.
To avoid the obvious problem of every client getting every message published by every other client, MQTT messages are published with what are called
topics
. A topic is a structured string that defines a location in a namespace with

"/"
used to delimit levels of that namespace's hierarchy. A topic could be, for example,
"/pumpmonitor/pumps/1/level"
or
"/stockmarket/prices/FOO"
. It's up to the developer to come up with a structure for topics which is appropriate to the task they are handling. Clients publish to an absolute topic with no ambiguity, but they can subscribe to a topic using wildcards to aggregate messages. A
"+"
represents one level of the implied hierarchy, while a
"#"
represents all the tree from that point on. Given the previous examples, one could subscribe to
"pumpmonitor/pumps/1/level"
for pump 1's level or
"pumpmonitor/pumps/+/level"
for all pump levels or even
"pumpmonitor/pumps/#"
for all pump activity.

In our short snippet we've published it to
"pahodemo/test"
. Finally we disconnect from the broker and we've completed an MQTT session. But where can we publish the message to?
Getting a Broker
A broker in MQTT handles receiving published messages and sending them on to any clients who have subscribed. In our brief example, we connect to a broker running on the local system. Although there are a number of brokers available, the
Mosquitto
broker is by far the easiest to configure and run for MQTT-only work. It's also open source, so you can
download it
and run it on your own system, be it Windows, Mac OS X, Linux or many other platforms. The Mosquitto broker code is also being
contributed to Eclipse
as part of a new project.
The Eclipse Foundation is no stranger to Mosquitto – it runs a public instance of Mosquitto as an MQTT sandbox on
m2m.eclipse.org
so if you cannot download and run your own Mosquitto server you can change the connection URI in the example to "tcp://m2m.eclipse.org:1883". Do remember this is a shared sandbox, so publishing to a topic used in this article may well be over-written by someone else reading this article and running examples.
Mosquitto's default configuration means it is set up to not use username/password authentication and accepts all connections on port 1883. It also comes with two clients,

mosquitto_pub
and
mosquitto_sub
, the latter of which will be useful when you are debugging your applications. Running:
will dump all new messages to the broker. Remember the quotes around the topic, especially with the
"#"
wildcard on Unix as, unquoted or unescaped, that marks the start of a comment and would see the rest of the command discarded. If you leave that command running and, in another window, run
'mosquitto_pub -t "mosquittodemo/test" -m "Hi"'
then you should see the
mosquitto_sub

In the IDE
To get our snippet of code running, we're going to use the Eclipse Maven support to handle dependencies. Create a new Java project and then select Configure → Convert to Maven project. First, as the Paho MQTT code isn't in Maven Central (yet), we need to include its repository – open the
pom.xml
file and after </version> add
Then we need to add the dependency for the Mqtt-client code. Still in the pom.xml file but this time, after </build>, add

appear. We've now got a basic Paho MQTT publish client running and we can start exploring the various options available.
Message options
Each message in MQTT can have its quality of service and retain flag set. The quality of service advises the code if and how it should ensure the message arrives. There are three options, 0 (At Most Once),1 (At Least Once) and 2 (Exactly Once). By default, a new message instance is set to "At Least Once", a Quality of Service (QoS) of 1, which means the sender will deliver the message at least once and, if there's no acknowledgement of it, it will keep sending it with a duplicate flag set until an acknowledgement turns up, at which point the client removes the message from its persisted set of messages.
A QoS of 0, "At Most Once", is the fastest mode, where the client doesn't wait for an acknowledgement. This means, of course, that if there’s a disconnection or server failure, a message may be lost. At the other end of the scale is a QoS of 2, "Exactly Once", which uses two pairs of exchanges, first to transfer the message and then to ensure only one copy has been received and is being processed. This does make Exactly Once the slower but most reliable QoS setting.

The retain flag for an
MqttMessage
is set to false by default. This means that a broker will not hold onto the message so that any subscribers arriving after the message was sent will not see the message. By setting the retain flag, the message is held onto by the broker, so when the late arrivers connect to the broker or clients create a new subscription they get all the relevant retained messages.
Connection options
When connecting to the broker, there are a number of options that can be set which are encapsulated in the
MqttConnectOptions
class. These include the keep-alive interval for maintaining the connection with the broker, the retry interval for delivering messages, the connection timeout period, the clean session flag, the connection's will and, for the Java side of the code, which
SocketFactory
to use.
If we modify our client so it reads:
We can experiment with the connection options. For this example, the interesting options are the clean flag and the will. When messages are sent with a QoS above 0, steps need to be taken to ensure that when a client reconnects it doesn't repeat messages and resumes the previous session with the broker. But if you want to ensure that all that state information is discarded at connection and disconnection, you set the clean session flag to true. How does the broker identify clients you may ask? Through that client id is the answer and is also the reason why you need to ensure that client ids are different.
The will option allows clients to prepare for the worst. Despite being called a will, it is more like a "letter left with a lawyer in case something suspicious happens to me". The will consists of a message which will be sent by the broker if the client disappears without cleanly closing the connection. Like a normal message, there's a topic, payload, QoS setting and retain flag. So, if we want to record clients failing by sending out an unretained but assured delivery message we can change the code to read:
Run the code and you'll find no change. If you want to test this, insert a

to simulate an abnormal termination. We're now sending messages happily, but we don't know when they've been delivered and we haven't subscribed to a topic yet.
Delivery callbacks
The core of listening to MQTT activity in the Java API is the
MqttCallback
interface. It allows the API to call code we have specified when a message arrives, when delivery of a message is completed or when the connection is lost. If we add
implements MqttCallback
to our
PahoDemo
class declaration, the Eclipse IDE will assist us to add needed imports and offer to implement the required methods:
Now all we need to do is tell the
MqttClient
that we have done this by adding
client.setCallback(this);
before using it to connect to the broker. With this in place, let’s look at when these methods will be called.

The
deliveryComplete()
callback gets called when a message has been completely delivered as per its quality of service setting. That means, for a QoS of 0, when the message has been written to the network, for a QoS of 1, when the message publication has been acknowledged and for a QoS of 2 when the message publication has not only been acknowledged but confirmed to have been the only copy of the message delivered.
As there is a callback, a developer may wonder if the publish method is asynchronous or blocking. The answer is that it can be either as it is controlled by the
MqttClient
setting
timeToWait
. This sets how long, in milliseconds, any action by the client will wait before returning control to the rest of the application. By default, this is set to
-1
which means never timeout and block till complete. If the code called
client.setTimeToWait(100);
then any call would return control to the application as soon as it had completed if it took less than 100 milliseconds, after 100 milliseconds or if there was a disconnection or shutdown. Calling
client.getPendingDeliveryTokens()
will return an array of tokens which contain information about messages that are currently "in-flight". Whichever way the

timeToWait
is set though, the
deliveryComplete()
method will still be called when a delivery is made.
Subscriptions
The
messageArrived()
callback method is the method invoked whenever any subscribed-to topic has received a message. The
MqttClient
's
subscribe()
and
unsubscribe()
methods set which topic's messages we are interested in. The simplest version is
client.subscribe("topicfilter")
which sets the subscription's quality of service to 1 as a default. We can of course set the QoS –

Loading seems to be taking a while.
Twitter may be over capacity or experiencing a momentary hiccup.
client.subscribe("topicfilter", qos)
– or subscribe with an array of filters and an optional array of QoS values to go with them. The QoS setting is, by the way, a maximum so that if you have subscribed with a QoS of 1, messages published with a QoS of 0 or 1 will be delivered at that QoS and messages published with a QoS of 2 will be delivered at a QoS of 1.
Once subscribed, messages will begin arriving at the
messageArrived()
callback method where the topic and
MqttMessage
are passed in as parameters. When in
messageArrived()
, newly arriving messages will be queued up and the acknowledgement for the message being processed will not be sent till the callback has cleanly completed. If you have complex processing of the message to do, copy and queue the data in some other mechanism to avoid blocking the messaging system.
Subscriptions are affected by the clean session flag used when establishing a connection. If a session has the clean setting set to false, the system should persist the subscriptions between sessions and shouldn’t need to resubscribe. With the clean flag set to true, the client will have to resubscribe when reconnecting. When a client does subscribe to a topic, it will receive all the retained values that match the topic they are requesting, even if the subscription’s topic query is in part or in whole intersecting with a previous subscription.
One important point to note is that we have, for simplicity, only covered the synchronous version of the API where every call to the MQTT API blocks and the only thing that comes through on its own schedule are inbound messages from subscriptions. This version of the API,
MqttClient
, is a thin wrapper around the more powerful asynchronous version of the API,
MqttAsyncClient
, where all calls do not block, giving their results either by the application monitoring a token which is returned by the call or by the completed action calling back to a class that implements an
IMqttActionListener

ResourceHandler
This is not a scalable example as it has the
MqttClient
bound to the resource handler, but if you incorporate this into the Jetty example, then whenever a request is handled by the servlet, it will publish that count to, in this case, a broker on localhost. The

user name and time of day to try and ensure non-clashing client ids.
Remember though that the recovery of sessions depends on the client id being the same between connections and here, unless we recorded and reused it, the client id will be different for every run. By default, the
MqttClient
opens a “clean” session; don’t use
generateClientId()
with a clean session set to “false” otherwise, every time the client starts up, debris from previous sessions will be left in the broker because it can’t tidy up as there’s no matching clientid to tidy up against.
Also notice we are publishing the statistics with a QoS of 0, because we aren't worried about the stats being delivered, but we are also setting the retain flag to true so that the broker will remember the most recently delivered value for any clients who subscribe to the statistics.
Wrapping up
So, MQTT and the Paho project gives us a flexible, lightweight protocol with Java and C and Lua and other implementations which can be easily tuned to a range of use cases and doesn't place requirements on how we pass data across it. It’s a powerful tool and we haven't even started looking at it in the environment it was designed for, in the Internet of Things connecting sensors to servers - we'll come to that in our next part of Practical MQTT with Paho.

A "+" represents one or more levels of the implied hierarchy, while a "#" represents all the tree from that point on.
Is a little bit misleading. The "+" represents exactly one level in the topic tree hierarchy.

Paho this was AMAZINGLY useful article
It has explained everything so simply and really does help
Have you got any examples of using AT commands (not SIMCOM as they have their entire library but more standard AT commads like AT+MIPCALL etc.)
The chip we are using only has standard commands Fibcom
Many thanks
