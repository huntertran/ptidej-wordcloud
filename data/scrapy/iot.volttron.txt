The Eclipse VOLTTRON software platform is Linux-based and capable of running on small, single-board computers as well as in the cloud. It deploys applications known as V-agents that gain access to energy data via automation systems, identifying and diagnosing problems such as erroneous temperature settings. The technology offers passive capabilities that report a problem, as well as active approaches that actually fix the problem. VOLTTRON can be configured to use any protocol needed to interface with devices or data sources.
The platform comprises several components and agents that provide services to other agents. Of these components, the information exchange bus (IEB) is central. All other VOLTTRON components communicate through the IEB using the publish/subscribe paradigm over a variety of topics. For example, a weather agent would publish weather information in a weather topic to which interested agents would subscribe. Drivers collect data from devices connected to the platform, publishing device data to and taking commands from the message bus (the platform includes supported drivers for BACnet and Modbus protocols). Historian applications store device data and analyze it, while a web-based user interface allows for management of VOLTTRON nodes and agents.

Eclipse Kuksa
Internet of Things
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

The mission of the top-level project is to provide open source technology that will be used to build IoT solutions for industry and consumers. It will focus on:
Standards and Protocols implementations that can easily be consumed by end solution developers as well as framework developers
Frameworks and Services that abstract the complexity of hardware, communication and data stack manipulation
Tools that facilitate the development of connected systems
Solutions that build ready-to-run solutions based on the other building blocks
This document describes the composition and organization of the project, roles and responsibilities of the participants, and development process for the project.
