The Eclipse VOLTTRON software platform is Linux-based and capable of running on small, single-board computers as well as in the cloud. It deploys applications known as V-agents that gain access to energy data via automation systems, identifying and diagnosing problems such as erroneous temperature settings. The technology offers passive capabilities that report a problem, as well as active approaches that actually fix the problem. VOLTTRON can be configured to use any protocol needed to interface with devices or data sources.
The platform comprises several components and agents that provide services to other agents. Of these components, the information exchange bus (IEB) is central. All other VOLTTRON components communicate through the IEB using the publish/subscribe paradigm over a variety of topics. For example, a weather agent would publish weather information in a weather topic to which interested agents would subscribe. Drivers collect data from devices connected to the platform, publishing device data to and taking commands from the message bus (the platform includes supported drivers for BACnet and Modbus protocols). Historian applications store device data and analyze it, while a web-based user interface allows for management of VOLTTRON nodes and agents.

) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section.
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
VOLTTRON™, developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and available as an open-source tool, provides an environment where data and devices connect seamlessly and securely to make decisions based on user needs and preferences.
Business, research and academic communities agree that VOLTTRON™ is an important and versatile resource for improving building system performance and creating a more flexible and reliable power grid. But the technology’s adaptability has significantly expanded its potential beyond buildings and the grid; users are applying the platform in ways not originally envisioned.
VOLTTRON™ is open source and publicly available from
GitHub
, and its ongoing development benefits from a highly collaborative approach. The U.S. Department of Energy views the technology as a central component of buildings-grid integration, and provides funding support. Updates and other advances are carried out by a PNNL research team working in concert with an active nationwide community of users.
Scope:
Eclipse VOLTTRON provides secure, extensible, and modular integration middleware for the Internet of Things, that supports the development of a wide range of loosely coupled, but tightly integrated connected applications.
Description:
The Eclipse VOLTTRON software platform is Linux-based and capable of running on small, single-board computers as well as in the cloud. It deploys applications known as V-agents that gain access to energy data via automation systems, identifying and diagnosing problems such as erroneous temperature settings. The technology offers passive capabilities that report a problem, as well as active approaches that actually fix the problem. VOLTTRON can be configured to use any protocol needed to interface with devices or data sources.
The platform comprises several components and agents that provide services to other agents. Of these components, the information exchange bus (IEB) is central. All other VOLTTRON components communicate through the IEB using the publish/subscribe paradigm over a variety of topics. For example, a weather agent would publish weather information in a weather topic to which interested agents would subscribe. Drivers collect data from devices connected to the platform, publishing device data to and taking commands from the message bus (the platform includes supported drivers for BACnet and Modbus protocols). Historian applications store device data and analyze it, while a web-based user interface allows for management of VOLTTRON nodes and agents.
Why Here?:
The Eclipse Foundation provides an environment where VOLTTRON can be developed by a much broader audience of software developers and adopted by businesses looking for state of the art solutions. Engaging these entities will enhance collaboration and strengthen the platform.

Proposal:
Eclipse VOLTTRON
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
VOLTTRON™, developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and available as an open-source tool, provides an environment where data and devices connect seamlessly and securely to make decisions based on user needs and preferences.
Business, research and academic communities agree that VOLTTRON™ is an important and versatile resource for improving building system performance and creating a more flexible and reliable power grid. But the technology’s adaptability has significantly expanded its potential beyond buildings and the grid; users are applying the platform in ways not originally envisioned.
VOLTTRON™ is open source and publicly available from
GitHub
, and its ongoing development benefits from a highly collaborative approach. The U.S. Department of Energy views the technology as a central component of buildings-grid integration, and provides funding support. Updates and other advances are carried out by a PNNL research team working in concert with an active nationwide community of users.
Scope:
Eclipse VOLTTRON provides secure, extensible, and modular integration middleware for the Internet of Things, that supports the development of a wide range of loosely coupled, but tightly integrated connected applications.
Description:
The Eclipse VOLTTRON software platform is Linux-based and capable of running on small, single-board computers as well as in the cloud. It deploys applications known as V-agents that gain access to energy data via automation systems, identifying and diagnosing problems such as erroneous temperature settings. The technology offers passive capabilities that report a problem, as well as active approaches that actually fix the problem. VOLTTRON can be configured to use any protocol needed to interface with devices or data sources.
The platform comprises several components and agents that provide services to other agents. Of these components, the information exchange bus (IEB) is central. All other VOLTTRON components communicate through the IEB using the publish/subscribe paradigm over a variety of topics. For example, a weather agent would publish weather information in a weather topic to which interested agents would subscribe. Drivers collect data from devices connected to the platform, publishing device data to and taking commands from the message bus (the platform includes supported drivers for BACnet and Modbus protocols). Historian applications store device data and analyze it, while a web-based user interface allows for management of VOLTTRON nodes and agents.

Interoperable
A successful platform must work across vendors and protocols and provide capabilities to simplify these interactions. VOLTTRON™, open and flexible by design, enables applications written by different organizations to easily and securely talk with both each other and devices being controlled.
Platform capabilities enable communication with a variety of devices through standard (Modbus, BACnet, etc.) or custom protocols. Also, VOLTTRON™ design eases integration of legacy systems by hiding complexities of device interactions. If the device can be made to interact, it can participate in the platform.
Virginia Tech, in using and testing the platform in its Building Energy Management Open-Source Software (BEMOSS), concluded that VOLTTRON™ is interoperable between devices from different manufacturers, a significant benefit in the field.

Secure
From the beginning, VOLTTRON™ developers actively collaborated with cyber security experts and built security
into
the technology, rather than “bolting it on” later. The commitment has continued, with developers regularly upgrading features in response to emerging requirements and VOLTTRON™ user feedback.
The platform applies a threat-model approach for determining software threats and vulnerabilities and how to reasonably reduce the attack surface and/or harm from a compromise. Through established mitigation strategies, VOLTTRON™ addresses a range of possible attack avenues and risks.

Cost Effective
The VOLTTRON™ software is open source and available to users at no cost. It was designed for small computing devices, such as Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black, and the platform itself uses minimal resources. This greatly reduces hardware costs for its deployment.
Users have found that other characteristics—such as VOLTTRON™’s security, interoperability between different devices, portability and flexibility, and easy application development—underscore the software’s cost-effectiveness and versatility. Reduced implementation costs and cycle time lead to productive solution development.

for managing deployed instances from a single central instance.
Installation
VOLTTRON is written in Python 3.6+ and runs on Linux Operating Systems. For users unfamiliar with those technologies, the following resources are recommended:
https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/
http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial
1. Install prerequisites
(
https://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/VOLTTRON-Prerequisites.html#volttron-prerequisites
).
From version 7.0, VOLTTRON requires python 3 with a minimum version of 3.6; it is tested only systems supporting that as a native package. On Debian-based systems (Ubuntu bionic, debian buster, raspbian buster), these can all be installed with the following commands:
(Note:
libffi-dev
seems to only be required on arm-based systems.)
On Redhat or CENTOS systems, these can all be installed with the following command:
2. Clone VOLTTRON code
From version 6.0, VOLTTRON supports two message buses - ZMQ and RabbitMQ.
3. Setup virtual environment

Developer Friendly
VOLTTRON™ was created as an overarching integration platform to bring together vendors, users and developers, enable rapid application development and testing, and support modern control strategies.
The platform is a cost and time saver. It is flexible, not linking applications to a specific language; interoperable across vendors and applications; and facilitates easy application development and scale-up.
These characteristics allow developers to work with devices, external resources, and each other over a common interface without worrying about underlying details, which enhances application development.

Example command:
Alternatively
You can download and install Erlang from
Erlang Solutions
. Please include OTP/components - ssl, public_key, asn1, and crypto. Also lock your version of Erlang using the
yum-plugin-versionlock
2. Configure hostname
Make sure that your hostname is correctly configured in /etc/hosts. See (
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24797947/os-x-and-rabbitmq-error-epmd-error-for-host-xxx-address-cannot-connect-to-ho
). If you are testing with VMs make please make sure to provide unique host names for each of the VM you are using.
The hostname should be resolvable to a valid IP when running on bridged mode. RabbitMQ checks for this during initial boot. Without this (for example, when running on a VM in NAT mode) RabbitMQ start would fail with the error "unable to connect to empd (port 4369) on ." Note: RabbitMQ startup error would show up in syslog (/var/log/messages) file and not in RabbitMQ logs (/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbitmq@hostname.log)
3. Bootstrap
This will build the platform and create a virtual Python environment and dependencies for RabbitMQ. It also installs RabbitMQ server as the current user. If an install path is provided, that path should exist and the user should have write permissions. RabbitMQ will be installed under

<install dir>/rabbitmq_server-3.7.7
as
$RABBITMQ_HOME
You can check if the RabbitMQ server is installed by checking its status. Please note, the
RABBITMQ_HOME
environment variable can be set in ~/.bashrc. If doing so, it needs to be set to the RabbitMQ installation directory (default path is
<user_home>/rabbitmq_server/rabbitmq_server-3.7.7
)

for a sample configuration file. At a minimum you will need to provide the host name and a unique common-name (under certificate-data) in the configuration file. Note: common-name must be unique and the general convention is to use
<voltttron instance name>-root-ca
.
Running the above command without the optional configuration file parameter will cause the user user to be prompted for all the required data in the command prompt vcfg will use that data to generate a rabbitmq_config.yml file in the
VOLTTRON_HOME
directory.
If the above configuration file is being used as a basis, be sure to update it with the hostname of the deployment (this should be the fully qualified domain name of the system).
This script creates a new virtual host and creates SSL certificates needed for this VOLTTRON instance. These certificates get created under the subdirectory "certificates" in your VOLTTRON home (typically in ~/.volttron). It then creates the main VIP exchange named "volttron" to route message between the platform and agents and alternate exchange to capture unrouteable messages.
NOTE: We configure the RabbitMQ instance for a single volttron_home and volttron_instance. This script will confirm with the user the volttron_home to be configured. The VOLTTRON instance name will be read from volttron_home/config if available, if not the user will be prompted for VOLTTRON instance name. To run the scripts without any prompts, save the the VOLTTRON instance name in volttron_home/config file and pass the VOLTTRON home directory as a command line argument. For example:
vcfg --vhome /home/vdev/.new_vhome --rabbitmq single
The Following are the example inputs for
vcfg --rabbitmq single
command. Since no config file is passed the script prompts for necessary details.
4. Test
We are now ready to start the VOLTTRON instance. If configured with a RabbitMQ message bus a config file would have been generated in
$VOLTTRON\_HOME/config
with the entry

message-bus=rmq
. If you need to revert back to ZeroMQ based VOLTTRON, you will have to either remove "message-bus" parameter or set it to default "zmq" in
$VOLTTRON\_HOME/config
and restart the volttron process. The following command starts the VOLTTORN process in the background:
This command causes the shell to enter the virtual Python environment and then starts the platform in debug (vv) mode with a log file named volttron.log.
Next, start an example listener to see it publish and subscribe to the message bus:
This script handles several different commands for installing and starting an agent after removing an old copy. This simple agent publishes a heartbeat message and listens to everything on the message bus. Look at the VOLTTRON log to see the activity:
Listener agent heartbeat publishes appear in the logs as:
To top the platform run the following command:

Adds Value
VOLTTRON™, in field tests and actual applications, adds value by reducing implementation, integration and application development costs, which allows users to devote resources to other needs. Value also comes in results. In power grid- and buildings-related deployments, the platform has delivered energy efficiency improvements.
VOLTTRON™ value-adding features include:
Built-in security, which likely will reduce platform maintenance costs over time
Quality results at lower costs—It is open source and runs on low-priced commodity boards ($35 or less), greatly enabling low-cost implementation and maintenance
Affordable application development
Interoperability, connecting devices, protocols, and other platforms
Availability of ongoing engagement and technical assistance provided by the VOLTTRON™ development team—The team holds regular “Office Hours” meetings with users to discuss new features and plans, collaborate and answer questions.

Boundless Potential
VOLTTRON™ is versatile. Designed initially to improve power grid operations, this technology enables decision-making and solutions for
any
need that requires collection, management and analysis of data streams. Just use your imagination!
VOLTTRON™ is:
Secure
Functional, supporting energy, operational and financial transactions between network entities
Scalable
Interoperable
Sophisticated yet simple—providing a readily useful environment for quick, cost-effective solution development.
Beyond grid and buildings, potential uses extend to improved interoperability between utility systems and proprietary home energy technologies; cybersecurity applications; data management; product tracking; energy efficiency in non-building disciplines, such as irrigation management; and more.
The VOLTTRON™ platform—and by extension, its users—continues to benefit from the U.S. Department of Energy’s ongoing development funding and support. DOE wants to optimize the platform for buildings-grid integration and transactive energy, but the agency also is supportive of alternate uses—and full realization—of the technology’s potential.
