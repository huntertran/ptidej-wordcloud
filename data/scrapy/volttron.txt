The Eclipse VOLTTRON software platform is Linux-based and capable of running on small, single-board computers as well as in the cloud. It deploys applications known as V-agents that gain access to energy data via automation systems, identifying and diagnosing problems such as erroneous temperature settings. The technology offers passive capabilities that report a problem, as well as active approaches that actually fix the problem. VOLTTRON can be configured to use any protocol needed to interface with devices or data sources.
The platform comprises several components and agents that provide services to other agents. Of these components, the information exchange bus (IEB) is central. All other VOLTTRON components communicate through the IEB using the publish/subscribe paradigm over a variety of topics. For example, a weather agent would publish weather information in a weather topic to which interested agents would subscribe. Drivers collect data from devices connected to the platform, publishing device data to and taking commands from the message bus (the platform includes supported drivers for BACnet and Modbus protocols). Historian applications store device data and analyze it, while a web-based user interface allows for management of VOLTTRON nodes and agents.

Secure
From the beginning, VOLTTRON™ developers actively collaborated with cyber security experts and built security into the technology, rather than “bolting it on” later. The commitment has continued, with developers regularly upgrading features in response to emerging requirements and VOLTTRON™ user feedback.
The platform applies a threat-model approach for determining software threats and vulnerabilities and how to reasonably reduce the attack surface and/or harm from a compromise. Through established mitigation strategies, VOLTTRON™ addresses a range of possible attack avenues and risks.

Open Source
VOLTTRON™ software, platform services, and agents are open source and employ a Berkeley Software Distribution-style license, allowing the free distribution and development of the software. The license supports organizations developing proprietary solutions on top of the open-source code.
The platform’s open-source status helps reduce operation, installation, programming and overall integration costs. Further, VOLTTRON™’s active community of users meets on a regular basis to discuss the technology and contribute improvements and solutions, which helps ensure VOLTTRON™’s ongoing usefulness and value. Learn more about this aspect of VOLTTRON™.
A separately licensed platform plugin provides additional capabilities to the platform for large-scale, real-world deployments.

Interoperable
A successful platform must work across vendors and protocols and provide capabilities to simplify these interactions. VOLTTRON™, open and flexible by design, enables applications written by different organizations to easily and securely talk with both each other and devices being controlled.
Platform capabilities enable communication with a variety of devices through standard (Modbus, BACnet, etc.) or custom protocols. Also, VOLTTRON™ design eases integration of legacy systems by hiding complexities of device interactions. If the device can be made to interact, it can participate in the platform.
Virginia Tech, in using and testing the platform in its Building Energy Management Open-Source Software (BEMOSS), concluded that VOLTTRON™ is interoperable between devices from different manufacturers, a significant benefit in the field.

Creation Review
Eclipse VOLTTRON Creation Review
Type: CreationState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, June 20, 2018Project: Eclipse VOLTTRONProposal:
Eclipse VOLTTRON
Parent Project: Eclipse IoTBackground: VOLTTRON™, developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and available as an open-source tool, provides an environment where data and devices connect seamlessly and securely to make decisions based on user needs and preferences.
Business, research and academic communities agree that VOLTTRON™ is an important and versatile resource for improving building system performance and creating a more flexible and reliable power grid. But the technology’s adaptability has significantly expanded its potential beyond buildings and the grid; users are applying the platform in ways not originally envisioned.
VOLTTRON™ is open source and publicly available from GitHub, and its ongoing development benefits from a highly collaborative approach. The U.S. Department of Energy views the technology as a central component of buildings-grid integration, and provides funding support. Updates and other advances are carried out by a PNNL research team working in concert with an active nationwide community of users.
Scope: Eclipse VOLTTRON provides secure, extensible, and modular integration middleware for the Internet of Things, that supports the development of a wide range of loosely coupled, but tightly integrated connected applications.
Description: The Eclipse VOLTTRON software platform is Linux-based and capable of running on small, single-board computers as well as in the cloud. It deploys applications known as V-agents that gain access to energy data via automation systems, identifying and diagnosing problems such as erroneous temperature settings. The technology offers passive capabilities that report a problem, as well as active approaches that actually fix the problem. VOLTTRON can be configured to use any protocol needed to interface with devices or data sources.

Driver framework for collecting data from and sending control actions to buildings and devices.
Historian framework for storing data.
Agent lifecycle managment in the platform
Web UI for managing deployed instances from a single central instance.
Installation
VOLTTRON is written in Python 3.6+ and runs on Linux Operating Systems. For
users unfamiliar with those technologies, the following resources are recommended:
https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/
http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial
1. Install prerequisites
(https://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/VOLTTRON-Prerequisites.html#volttron-prerequisites).
From version 7.0, VOLTTRON requires python 3 with a minimum version of 3.6; it is tested only systems supporting that as a native package.
On Debian-based systems (Ubuntu bionic, debian buster, raspbian buster), these can all be installed with the following commands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev python3-dev python3-venv openssl libssl-dev libevent-dev git
(Note: libffi-dev seems to only be required on arm-based systems.)
On Redhat or CENTOS systems, these can all be installed with the following command:
sudo yum update
sudo yum install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel python3.6-devel pythone3.6-venv openssl openssl-devel libevent-devel git
2. Clone VOLTTRON code
From version 6.0, VOLTTRON supports two message buses - ZMQ and RabbitMQ.
git clone https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron --branch <branch name>
3. Setup virtual environment
Steps for ZMQ
George Hernandez is a Committer for Eclipse VOLTTRON | projects.eclipse.org
The platform comprises several components and agents that provide services to other agents. Of these components, the information exchange bus (IEB) is central. All other VOLTTRON components communicate through the IEB using the publish/subscribe paradigm over a variety of topics. For example, a weather agent would publish weather information in a weather topic to which interested agents would subscribe. Drivers collect data from devices connected to the platform, publishing device data to and taking commands from the message bus (the platform includes supported drivers for BACnet and Modbus protocols). Historian applications store device data and analyze it, while a web-based user interface allows for management of VOLTTRON nodes and agents.
Why Here?: The Eclipse Foundation provides an environment where VOLTTRON can be developed by a much broader audience of software developers and adopted by businesses looking for state of the art solutions. Engaging these entities will enhance collaboration and strengthen the platform.
Initial Contribution: All source code, open source software agents and documentation for VOLTTRON is located at https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron.

Make sure that your hostname is correctly configured in /etc/hosts.
See (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24797947/os-x-and-rabbitmq-error-epmd-error-for-host-xxx-address-cannot-connect-to-ho). If you are testing with VMs make please make sure to provide unique host names for each of the VM you are using.
The hostname should be resolvable to a valid IP when running on bridged mode. RabbitMQ checks for this during initial
boot. Without this (for example, when running on a VM in NAT mode) RabbitMQ start would fail with the error "unable to
connect to empd (port 4369) on ." Note: RabbitMQ startup error would show up in syslog (/var/log/messages) file
and not in RabbitMQ logs (/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbitmq@hostname.log)
3. Bootstrap
cd volttron
python3 bootstrap.py --rabbitmq [optional install directory. defaults to
<user_home>/rabbitmq_server]
This will build the platform and create a virtual Python environment and
dependencies for RabbitMQ. It also installs RabbitMQ server as the current user.
If an install path is provided, that path should exist and the user should have
write permissions. RabbitMQ will be installed under <install dir>/rabbitmq_server-3.7.7.
The rest of the documentation refers to the directory <install dir>/rabbitmq_server-3.7.7 as
$RABBITMQ_HOME
You can check if the RabbitMQ server is installed by checking its status. Please
note, the RABBITMQ_HOME environment variable can be set in ~/.bashrc. If doing so,
it needs to be set to the RabbitMQ installation directory (default path is
<user_home>/rabbitmq_server/rabbitmq_server-3.7.7)
echo 'export RABBITMQ_HOME=$HOME/rabbitmq_server/rabbitmq_server-3.7.7'|sudo tee --append ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
$RABBITMQ_HOME/sbin/rabbitmqctl status

4. Activate the environment
source env/bin/activate
You can deactivate the environment at any time by running deactivate.
5. Create RabbitMQ setup for VOLTTRON:
vcfg --rabbitmq single [optional path to rabbitmq_config.yml]
Refer to examples/configurations/rabbitmq/rabbitmq_config.yml
for a sample configuration file.
At a minimum you will need to provide the host name and a unique common-name
(under certificate-data) in the configuration file. Note: common-name must be
unique and the general convention is to use <voltttron instance name>-root-ca.
Running the above command without the optional configuration file parameter will
cause the user user to be prompted for all the required data in the command prompt
vcfg will use that data to generate a rabbitmq_config.yml file in the VOLTTRON_HOME
directory.
If the above configuration file is being used as a basis, be sure to update it with
the hostname of the deployment (this should be the fully qualified domain name
of the system).
This script creates a new virtual host and creates SSL certificates needed
for this VOLTTRON instance. These certificates get created under the subdirectory
"certificates" in your VOLTTRON home (typically in ~/.volttron). It
then creates the main VIP exchange named "volttron" to route message between
the platform and agents and alternate exchange to capture unrouteable messages.
NOTE: We configure the RabbitMQ instance for a single volttron_home and
volttron_instance. This script will confirm with the user the volttron_home to
be configured. The VOLTTRON instance name will be read from volttron_home/config
if available, if not the user will be prompted for VOLTTRON instance name. To
run the scripts without any prompts, save the the VOLTTRON instance name in
volttron_home/config file and pass the VOLTTRON home directory as a command line
argument. For example: vcfg --vhome /home/vdev/.new_vhome --rabbitmq single
The Following are the example inputs for vcfg --rabbitmq single command. Since no
config file is passed the script prompts for necessary details.

/home/vdev/new_vhome2/certificates/certs/volttron1-root-ca.crt to only admin user. For example: sudo chown root /home/vdev/new_vhome2/certificates/certs/volttron1-root-ca.crt
- A new admin user was created with user name: volttron1-admin and password=default_passwd.
You could change this user's password by logging into <https://cs_cbox.pnl.gov:15671/> Please update /home/vdev/new_vhome2/rabbitmq_config.yml if you change password
#######################
4. Test
We are now ready to start the VOLTTRON instance. If configured with a RabbitMQ message bus a config file would have been
generated in $VOLTTRON\_HOME/config with the entry message-bus=rmq. If you need to revert back to ZeroMQ based
VOLTTRON, you will have to either remove "message-bus" parameter or set it to default "zmq" in $VOLTTRON\_HOME/config
and restart the volttron process. The following command starts the VOLTTORN process in the background:
volttron -vv -l volttron.log &
This command causes the shell to enter the virtual Python environment and then starts the platform in debug (vv) mode
with a log file named volttron.log.
Next, start an example listener to see it publish and subscribe to the message bus:
scripts/core/upgrade-listener
This script handles several different commands for installing and starting an agent after removing an old copy. This
simple agent publishes a heartbeat message and listens to everything on the message bus. Look at the VOLTTRON log to see
the activity:
tail volttron.log
Listener agent heartbeat publishes appear in the logs as:
'GOOD'
'GOOD'
To top the platform run the following command:
./stop-volttron
Next Steps
There are several walkthroughs to explore additional aspects of the platform:
Agent Development Walkthrough
Demonstration of the management UI
RabbitMQ setup with Federation and Shovel plugins
Backward compatibility with the RabbitMQ message bus
Acquiring Third Party Agent Code
Third party agents are available under the volttron-applications repository. In
order to use those agents, clone the volttron-applications repository into the same
directory as the VOLTTRON source code:
cd <parent directory of volttron>
git clone https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron-applications.git develop
