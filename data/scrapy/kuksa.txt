About
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

When Eclipse Kuksa meets Eclipse SUMO [VIDEO]
on May 28, 2019
This video features an approach for connecting the Eclipse SUMO track simulation with the open source connected vehicle ecosystem Eclipse Kuksa. More precisely, Eclipse SUMO is used to simulate traffic scenarios including microscopic properties like the position or emission. The generated data of each vehicle is then be sent to the message gateway of the Kuksa IoT Cloud platform and delegated to an according example service that consumes the data.

Appstacle Use Case: Remote Driver Authentication with Eclipse Kuksa
on April 18, 2019
The Appstacle Turkish consortium, including Koçsistem, Otokar and Netaş, has created a Remote Driver Authentication demo based on the Eclipse Kuksa platform. Within the project, various companies or groups of companies, have focused on several use cases that support the vision of an ecosystem for purchasing and downloading in-vehicle applications. Otokar, a vehicle manufacturer, is tasked with integrating these scenarios and testing them on real vehicles. Otokar and the rest of the Turkish consortium are focused on the driver and passenger authentication scenarios.

Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.
This ecosystem will provide a comprehensive environment across various frameworks and technologies for # the in-vehicle platform, # the cloud platform, and # an app development IDE - that is, the complete tooling stack for the connected vehicle domain (see Figure 1 below). Essential to this environment will be the capabilities for collecting, storing, and analysing vehicle data in the cloud as well as the transmission of diverse information such as cloud calculation results (e.g. improved routing), software maintenance updates or even complete new applications. While many IoT solutions exist in the Eclipse IoT ecosystem, Eclipse Kuksa combines the necessary existing technologies and fills the gaps for the specific requirements of the connected embedded real-time nature of the automotive domain.

Get in touch! There is the
kuksa-dev mailing list
and a weekly
Zoom meeting
, every Thursday 1-2pm (CET/CEST).
In the project we agreed upon the following approach to add contributions to the project.
Meet the Definition of Done (DoD)
A review took place for the code
The new feature was at least once tested manually, deployed to a running test instance
Clearly outline third party dependencies
Definition of Done
First, we have DoD for solved issues. Please check if you met all the items in the following list:
File headers in file OK (see section
License Headers
for details)
Each new feature is developed in a separate branch
Development branches should be named like
<github-nickname>/<issue>/<description>
, e.g. bs-jokri/#2/fix-connection-handling
Coding style
Clean code is encouraged (see ‘Clean Code’ by Robert C. Martin or the
Clean Code Cheatsheet
. Reviewers might refer to specific clean code practices to help improve contributed code.
GitHub Repositories

Documentation
Provide the necessary technical documentation of your feature in the respective Github repository that you contribute to. Documentation is in markdown and it either included in the top-level README.md file of the Github repository, or linked from there.
Update the high-level overview of Kuksa in the
kuksa.integration Wiki at Github
. From the wiki, provide links to relevant technical documentation in the Github repositories.
Commit style
Please write brief and useful commit messages: Separate the subject from body with a blank line because the subject line is shown in the git history and should summarize the commit body. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules
has more tips and details.
Before you push your commits to a repository, you can squash your commits into one or more logical units of work, e.g. if you want to add a new feature solely in a single commit.

Pro Git book
has a great section on
Rewriting History

August 30, 2018
Hacking 3 Days @ IDiAL, FH-Dortmund, for Eclipse Kuksa Features 13 Hackers met in Dortmund on August, 28th until 30th of August to work on an end-to-end use case scenario along with new Eclipse Kuksa technologies. 20 CQs, 2 major GitHub pull-requests, and 21035 LOCs were the results. Of course, the LOCs also contain content from work prior to the Hackathon. More precisely, the Eclipse Kuksa Appstore was migrated to an Eclipse HawkBit Server, that transmits applications wirelessly to an Eclipse HawkBit client running on a device (Raspberry Pi) that runs the Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux + Kuksa technologies).

git pull --rebase
) instead of merging so all commits can be signed off. You can also
configure git to rebase by default
you IDE will also have according configuration options.
If you are not a committer to the project your commits need to be signed off with a valid Eclipse user account. Check the Eclipse handbook for details (
Eclipse Project Handbook
).
Review
If you conduct a code review, please look at the following issues:
Is code style ok, not really formatting, but issues like style attributes in HTML tags or exception handling useful
Are DoD items reached
Are there any design / architecture issues
Does the new feature fit the overall project goal, is it suitable for the community
Manual Test
If applicable the new feature should at least be deployed and tested by someone before actually merged to master. This could be done by the same person that is doing the review but could be performed by another person.
After review and tests are finished it should be documented who actually did the review and the test. Do this with the following lines in the comments of the PR.
and
Third party dependencies
If you use third party content (import / include …), you are required to list each third party content explicitly with its version number in the documentation or your pull-request comment. Please note that GPL software cannot be approved for Eclipse Kuksa.
Licensing and file header
All files contributed require headers - this will ensure the license and copyright clearing at the end. Also, all contributions must have the same license as the original source.
