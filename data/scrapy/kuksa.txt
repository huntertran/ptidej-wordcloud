Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.
This ecosystem will provide a comprehensive environment across various frameworks and technologies for (a) the in-vehicle platform, (b) the cloud platform, and (c) an app development IDE - that is, the complete tooling stack for the connected vehicle domain (see Figure 1 below). Essential to this environment will be the capabilities for collecting, storing, and analysing vehicle data in the cloud as well as the transmission of diverse information such as cloud calculation results (e.g. improved routing), software maintenance updates or even complete new applications. While many IoT solutions exist in the Eclipse IoT ecosystem, Eclipse Kuksa combines the necessary existing technologies and fills the gaps for the specific requirements of the connected embedded real-time nature of the automotive domain.

Eclipse Kuksa.val DBC Feeder Demo [Video] This demo showcases the features of the kuksa.val (https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val) server. While the automotive world is full of standards, there are not a lot of useful standards for an I(o)T world. Useful here means Standardize on semantics, not technology only Usable across vendors, by anyone (car manufacturers, suppiers, aftermarket, third parties) Building on, or interacting with, common IT technologies One of the more useful approaches in this context is the Genivi Vehicle signal specification (VSS) (https://github.

Welcome to the
Eclipse KUKSA
Wiki Page.
Today automotive software-intensive systems are developed in silos by each car manufacturer or original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in-house. This approach cannot meet the long-term challenges of the industry. One solution is to establish a standard car-to-cloud connection, open for external applications and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising safety and security. The Eclipse KUKSA project implements the open source part of the
APPSTACLE research project
. It will include an open and secure cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via open in-car and Internet connection and is supported by an integrated open source software development ecosystem.

Eclipse Kuksa
Release:
0.1.0
Description:
Eclipse Kuksa Release 0.1.0
Device owners within this environment can select applications over an Appstore and install them on their target device. Such applications can exchange data with or store data in the cloud. Therefore, required software on the device is directly included within images built for (ARM) platforms such as the Raspberry Pi3 via provided build scripts. Furthermore, developers can publish new applications to the Appstore and register new devices for specific Appstore users.
For a more detailed description of the deliverables, please visit the
release plan
tab =>
deliverables
.
Architectural Issues:
The development around the Eclipse Kuksa cloud is so far more a proof-of-concept and not intended to provide a direct production ready and secure deployment.
The integrated services often use the respective standard credentials (e.g. admin/admin)
The Eclipse Kuksa cloud uses certificates from Let’s Encrypt which should be replaced for commercial deployments

Wednesday, January 22, 2020
Project:
Eclipse Kuksa
Release:
0.2.0
Description:
The Eclipse Kuksa 0.2.0 release's main focus is on on integrating the cloud and in-vehicle with a holistic authorization and authentication system based on Keycloak. Apart from that, several other interesting features and improvements have been introduced.
The Kuksa IDE now provides typescript extensions to establish an end-to-end workflow in the Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. As the In-Vehicle gateway can be run on different operating systems (Raspbian, AGL, Debian, Apertis, etc.) or hardware architectures (arm64 etc.), In-Vehicle applications will be provided in a generic way via docker images. Therefore, a build script allows to generate target-specific docker images. Based on a generated .yaml config file and a Python-based script, the resulting docker images can then be published to the app store and hawkbit respectively. The typescript extensions can be used in either a local VSCode instance or on cloud-based IDEs such as Eclipse Che 7 (based on Eclipse Theia) or GitPod.

Scope:
Eclipse Kuksa unifies technologies across the vehicle, IoT, cloud, and security domains in order to provide an open source ecosystem to developers addressing challenges of the electrified and connected vehicle era. In-vehicle and cloud applications as well as their development infrastructure, maintenance approaches, security, and over-the-air (OTA) update and upgrade management are, with a few exceptions, completely within the scope of Eclipse Kuksa.
Currently, vehicle connectivity applies to mobile networks (and related infrastructure such as clouds, servers, etc.), other vehicles, and local infrastructures (traffic lights, local entities cf. edge computing). Although proprietary approaches provide partial solutions, developers have no access to either open source solutions nor comprehensive ecosystems that allow common connected vehicle development initiatives across suppliers, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and tooling enterprises. Eclipse Kuksa brings comprehensive connectivity solutions to the public while combining diverse technologies of vehicle, IoT, cloud, and security domains.
While safety is out of scope, Eclipse Kuksa addresses maintenance through providing, but not applying, OTA updates or upgrades, Cloud, and in-vehicle applications, as well as state-of-the-art platforms and technologies for in-vehicle communication and data transmission. Demonstration applications will be made available, but sophisticated cloud and in-vehicle applications are generally subject to community or closed-source development processes. Working with this premise, Eclipse Kuksa will support all the necessary development technologies required for such applications.

The Kuksa IDE now provides typescript extensions to establish an end-to-end workflow in the Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. As the In-Vehicle gateway can be run on different operating systems (Raspbian, AGL, Debian, Apertis, etc.) or hardware architectures (arm64 etc.), In-Vehicle applications will be provided in a generic way via docker images. Therefore, a build script allows to generate target-specific docker images. Based on a generated .yaml config file and a Python-based script, the resulting docker images can then be published to the app store and hawkbit respectively. The typescript extensions can be used in either a local VSCode instance or on cloud-based IDEs such as Eclipse Che 7 (based on Eclipse Theia) or GitPod.

Welcome to the
Eclipse KUKSA
Wiki Page.
Today automotive software-intensive systems are developed in silos by each car manufacturer or original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in-house. This approach cannot meet the long-term challenges of the industry. One solution is to establish a standard car-to-cloud connection, open for external applications and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising safety and security. The Eclipse KUKSA project implements the open source part of the
APPSTACLE research project
. It will include an open and secure cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via open in-car and Internet connection and is supported by an integrated open source software development ecosystem.

elm327-visdatafeeder - ELM 327 app that reads OBDII data from the vehicle and feeds data to the w3c-visserver.
kuksa-hawkbit - Barebone API for connecting with Hawkbit. Will be shortly replaced with kuksa-appmanager.
w3c-visserver-api - W3C Vehicle Information Specification API.
direct-access-api - Enables sending CAN messages from the cloud to vehicle using Websocket.
datalogger-http - Example app that sends data from the vehicle to an Eclipse Hono instance with http.
datalogger-mqtt - Example app that sends data from the vehicle to an Eclipse Hono instance with mqtt.
remoteAccess - Example app that subscribes to control topic with Hono and receives commands sent.
kuksa-appmanager - Hawkbit appmanager which deploys in-vehicle apps as docker conatiners and more..
email-notifier - Example app that talks to an email-server and sends e-mails to the configured email address. Used at the moment only for internal demos
Cloud repo:
HonoInfluxDBConnector: A Spring-Boot application that connects a running Eclipse Hono instance with a running InfluxDB instance so that messages received by Hono can be stored in InfluxDB. This is especially useful if one wants to easily create a visualization of some measurements eg with Grafana.
AppStore: A Spring-Boot application that connects a running Eclipse HawkBit instance and provides a GUI to manage vehicle (and eventually cloud) applications
Integration repo:
Eclipse HONO API (including MQTT) and Hawkbit API tests.
App repo:
A simple KUKSA app that can send location data to the Traccar GPS tracking suite

Review Information
Eclipse Kuksa Release 0.1.0
Device owners within this environment can select applications over an Appstore and install them on their target device. Such applications can exchange data with or store data in the cloud. Therefore, required software on the device is directly included within images built for (ARM) platforms such as the Raspberry Pi3 via provided build scripts. Furthermore, developers can publish new applications to the Appstore and register new devices for specific Appstore users.

The Kuksa IDE is now realized as an Eclipse Che Plugin to establish an end-to-end workflow in the Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. As the In-Vehicle gateway can be run on different operating systems (Raspbian, AGL, Debian etc.) or hardware architectures (arm64 etc.), In-Vehicle applications will be provided in a generic way via docker images. Therefore, a build script allows to generate target-specific docker images. Based on a generated .yaml config file and a Python-based script, the resulting docker images can then be published to the app store and hawkbit respectively.

We use
The Kuksa IDE now provides typescript extensions to establish an end-to-end workflow in the Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. As the In-Vehicle gateway can be run on different operating systems (Raspbian, AGL, Debian, Apertis, etc.) or hardware architectures (arm64 etc.), In-Vehicle applications will be provided in a generic way via docker images. Therefore, a build script allows to generate target-specific docker images. Based on a generated .yaml config file and a Python-based script, the resulting docker images can then be published to the app store and hawkbit respectively. The typescript extensions can be used in either a local VSCode instance or on cloud-based IDEs such as Eclipse Che 7 (based on Eclipse Theia) or GitPod.

If this is succesful you can skip to
using KUKSA.val
.
Building KUKSA.val
KUKSA.val uses the cmake build system. First install the required packages. On Ubuntu 20.04 this can be achieved by
Then create a build folder inside the kuksa.val folder and execute cmake
If there are any missing dependencies, cmake will tell you. If everythig works fine, execute make
(if you have more cores, you can speed up compilation with something like
make -j8
Additional information about our cmake setup (in case you need adavanced options or intend to extend it) can be
found here

Description:
The Kuksa IDE is now realized as an Eclipse Che Plugin to establish an end-to-end workflow in the Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. As the In-Vehicle gateway can be run on different operating systems (Raspbian, AGL, Debian etc.) or hardware architectures (arm64 etc.), In-Vehicle applications will be provided in a generic way via docker images. Therefore, a build script allows to generate target-specific docker images. Based on a generated .yaml config file and a Python-based script, the resulting docker images can then be published to the app store and hawkbit respectively.

Kuksa-InVehicle Repo
Eclipse Kuksa
includes an open and secure cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via open in-car and Internet connection and is supported by an integrated open source software development ecosystem. The Eclipse Kuksa project conatins a set of repositories and this repo is one among those that contains in-vehicle platform code and also contains required layers and bindings to build a Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) distribution. The in-vehicle platform is primarily designed to work with AGL. However the individual components found in this repo could be used on other platforms as well.
Projects
agl-kuksa
- Scripts to automate AGL build system with the meta-kuksa layers.
elm327-visdatafeeder
- ELM 327 app that reads OBDII data from the vehicle and feeds data to the w3c-visserver.
kuksa-hawkbit
- Barebone API for connecting with Hawkbit. Will be shortly replaced with kuksa-appmanager.
w3c-visserver-api
- A proof-of-concept implementation of a modular Intrusion Detection System (IDS), whose architecture enables a distributed deployment of modules.
FOTA-raspberrypi
- The FOTA scripts are used by the kuksa-appmanager to flash firmware images to the Raspberry Pi.
netIDS
- A network intrusion detection implementation that scans a CAN bus and tries to detect anomalies.
datalogger-http
- Example app that sends data from the vehicle to an Eclipse Hono instance with http.
datalogger-mqtt
- Example app that sends data from the vehicle to an Eclipse Hono instance with mqtt.
remoteAccess
- Example app that subscribes to control topic with Hono and receives commands sent.
email-notifier
- Example app that talks to an email-server and sends e-mails to the configured email address. Used at the moment only for internal demos.
Cloud
The Eclipse Kuksa Cloud forms the counterpart to the in-Vehicle projects. For the Eclipse Kuksa 0.1.0 release, deployment scripts and an Appstore are provided.
Deployment scripts
- to setup an Eclipse Kuksa Kubernetes cloud cluster (https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.cloud/tree/master/deployment)

HonoInfluxDBConnector
- A Spring-Boot application that connects to an Eclipse Hono instance with a running InfluxDB database so that messages received by Hono can be stored in the InfluxDB. This is especially useful to easily create a visualization of some measurements eg with Grafana.
Eclipse Kuksa Cloud software will further be provided as binary artifacts at the [Eclipse Kuksa Download Page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.kuksa/downloads).
Apps
Eclipse Kuksa application projects are subdivided into cloud and in-vehicle applications. In-Vehicle (docker) apps can be published to the Eclipse Kuksa App-Store and Eclipse HawkBit using the *app-publisher* project (https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.apps/tree/master/kuksa-app-publisher).
For the Eclipse Kuksa 0.1.0 release, the following in-vehicle applications are available:
kuksa-cloud-dashboard
- Connects to the w3c-visserver service via Websocket. Reads the RPM, Speed, Fuel status and also custom DTC from the w3c-visserver to sends this information as telemetry data to the Hono MQTT adapter.
kuksa-cloud-mechanic
- Connects to the w3c-visserver service via Websocket and communicates with the Eclipse Hono MQTT adapter. Consequently, commands can be sent to a vehicle remotely.
kuksa-traccar-client
- Sends location (GPS) data to the Traccar GPS tracking suite (https://www.traccar.org).

This project contains documentation and implementation to setup an Eclipse Che Kuksa instance, which eases the development of Kuksa In-Vehicle applications as well as Kuksa Cloud services. With the Eclipse Kuksa 0.1.0 release, only Che_v6.10 is supported (https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.ide).
Future releases will contain Eclipse Theia extensions, which are compliant to Eclipse Che 7 and support Kuksa in-vehicle application build processes, application registrations and transmissions to the Eclipse Kuksa Appstore and the Eclipse Kuksa Cloud.
Compatibility:
Since this is the initial Eclipse Kuksa release, there are no incompatibilities with previous versions.
Target Environments:
Provided scripts to build AGL images are based on AGL Funky Flounder 6.0.1
Images are currently supported on ARM platforms Raspberry Pi3 and Raspberry Compute Module 3 (Lite)
Cloud deployment scripts require Kubernetes

Eclipse Kuksa Release 0.1.0
Device owners within this environment can select applications over an Appstore and install them on their target device. Such applications can exchange data with or store data in the cloud. Therefore, required software on the device is directly included within images built for (ARM) platforms such as the Raspberry Pi3 via provided build scripts. Furthermore, developers can publish new applications to the Appstore and register new devices for specific Appstore users.
For a more detailed description of the deliverables, please visit the
release plan
tab =>
deliverables
.
Architectural Issues:
The development around the Eclipse Kuksa cloud is so far more a proof-of-concept and not intended to provide a direct production ready and secure deployment.
The integrated services often use the respective standard credentials (e.g. admin/admin)
The Eclipse Kuksa cloud uses certificates from Let’s Encrypt which should be replaced for commercial deployments
Eclipse Kuksa integrates Eclipse Hono 0.8 which is not the newest version
Security Issues:
The default user/password configuration for
AGL image

Status message
This proposal has been approved and the
Eclipse Kuksa
project has been created.
Eclipse Kuksa
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process
) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section.
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
Eclipse Kuksa provides technologies across the connected vehicle domain.
Automotive systems especially lack open technologies that are accessible to developers and enterprises focusing on IoT (Internet of Things) systems or cloud applications. Eclipse Kuksa closes these gaps and provides the comprehensive ecosystem to address related challenges with the help of platforms for (a) in-vehicle, (b) cloud, and (c) connected vehicle applications development. The publicly funded European ITEA research project
APPSTACLE
forms a basis for addressing such challenges. Eclipse Kuksa will further bring the ecosystem into the Eclipse community in order to widen its applicability and usage amongst and beyond its project partners such as Ericsson, Bosch, NXP and others.
The name Kuksa has its origins in a carved wooden mug from Finland. A Kuksa, with its individual character, has to be shared with and eventually bequeathed by close friends and cannot be bought for oneself. This sharing, as well as the connection that extends across generations, is meant also to reflect the spirit of the open source Eclipse Kuksa project.
Scope:
Eclipse Kuksa unifies technologies across the vehicle, IoT, cloud, and security domains in order to provide an open source ecosystem to developers addressing challenges of the electrified and connected vehicle era. In-vehicle and cloud applications as well as their development infrastructure, maintenance approaches, security, and over-the-air (OTA) update and upgrade management are, with a few exceptions, completely within the scope of Eclipse Kuksa.
Currently, vehicle connectivity applies to mobile networks (and related infrastructure such as clouds, servers, etc.), other vehicles, and local infrastructures (traffic lights, local entities cf. edge computing). Although proprietary approaches provide partial solutions, developers have no access to either open source solutions nor comprehensive ecosystems that allow common connected vehicle development initiatives across suppliers, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and tooling enterprises. Eclipse Kuksa brings comprehensive connectivity solutions to the public while combining diverse technologies of vehicle, IoT, cloud, and security domains.
While safety is out of scope, Eclipse Kuksa addresses maintenance through providing, but not applying, OTA updates or upgrades, Cloud, and in-vehicle applications, as well as state-of-the-art platforms and technologies for in-vehicle communication and data transmission. Demonstration applications will be made available, but sophisticated cloud and in-vehicle applications are generally subject to community or closed-source development processes. Working with this premise, Eclipse Kuksa will support all the necessary development technologies required for such applications.
Description:
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.
This ecosystem will provide a comprehensive environment across various frameworks and technologies for (a) the in-vehicle platform, (b) the cloud platform, and (c) an app development IDE - that is, the complete tooling stack for the connected vehicle domain (see Figure 1 below). Essential to this environment will be the capabilities for collecting, storing, and analysing vehicle data in the cloud as well as the transmission of diverse information such as cloud calculation results (e.g. improved routing), software maintenance updates or even complete new applications. While many IoT solutions exist in the Eclipse IoT ecosystem, Eclipse Kuksa combines the necessary existing technologies and fills the gaps for the specific requirements of the connected embedded real-time nature of the automotive domain.
Why Here?:
Eclipse is widely used in the automotive software industry as well as the IoT domain. Eclipse Kuksa will add value to the Eclipse community by establishing a connected vehicle ecosystem consisting of three major platforms. The ecosystem will be a basis for building customized, proprietary, open- and closed source systems. The Eclipse Kuksa project expects to benefit from wider visibility in the community and an extended open collaboration with interested parties.
Technical details and cooperation:
The Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem is built on existing Eclipse Frameworks such as:
Eclipse Hono (Cloud backend and frontend, message routing)
Eclipse Hawkbit (device management, OTA)
Eclipse Ditto (digital twins: abstraction levels, synchronization, state,....)
Eclipse Leshan (IoT management, lightweight m2m)
Eclipse MosQuitto (MQTT)
Eclipse Keti (Security)
More technologies likely to be used:
Eclipse Sumo (traffic simulation)
Keycloak (identity access management, security)

utomotive
G
rade
L
inux (AGL, in-vehicle basis platform)
Eclipse BIRT (Dev IDE visualizations)
InfluxDB, REST API, ...
Licenses:
Eclipse Public License 2.0
Legal Issues:
All committer agreed to publish under the EPL.
In-Vehicle developments will adapt to Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) that is partially LGPL and GPL. The Eclipse Kuksa developers will clarify if AGL code can be fully defined as a dependency i.e. that no AGL code must be included in Eclipse Kuksa. However, an adapted AGL build will be secondary licensed
such that the combined work will be licensed under the GPL-2.0, and then distributed as combined work under the GPL-2.0. AGL c
ontent that includes a secondary license clause will link directly with content that is licensed under the terms of that secondary license
(see EPL2.0 FAQ). Secondary licensed build results are not intended to be hosted at Eclipse.
Project Scheduling:
Initial contribution expected by Q1 2018 (Kuksa 0.1)
Release cycle for the cloud platform is planned every 6 months (Kuksa 0.2 by Q3 2018, etc.)
With the end of the publicly funded APPSTACLE project, the first major release Eclipse Kuksa 1.0 is expected
In-vehicle and APP Dev IDE development activities are not planned yet
Future Work:
Eclipse Kuksa will combine the technologies mentioned in the 'Why Here?' section in order to establish the comprehensive ecosystem that securely allows using vehicle data and transmitting generated cloud results. Concurrent work packages thereby address connectivity challenges, demonstrations, as well as cloud and in-vehicle implementations. By Q4 2018, the infrastructure should be complete and by Q4 2019 the ecosystem should be fluently working with the demonstrators and libraries and APIs should allow tailoring cloud applications towards individual needs.
In order to grow the community around Eclipse Kuksa, its development will be spread across research publications at conferences, workshops, booths, or similar events as well as newsletters around the cloud, IoT, and automotive domains. Consequently, interested and related developers will clearly notice Eclipse Kuksa's benefits and hopefully participate at its open source basis. Already its close relationship with other projects will strengthen Eclipse Kuksa's dissemination. Additionally, the involved partners of the publicly funded APPSTACLE project will utilise Eclipse Kuksa around their developments and include it for customer related projects.

Source Code
Initial Contribution:
Eclipse Kuksa will be divided into several repositories:
Github (basically for in-vehicle developments)
Kuksa.AGL
(wrapper: scripts, separate builds for different licenses)
Kuksa.meta
(recipes to utilize basic Kuksa technologies, e.g., regarding Eclipse Hono, Eclipse Mosquitto, ... )
Kuksa.meta-dev
(recipes to utilize development tooling such as debugging, tracing, logging, ...)
Kuksa.meta-rover
(available at https://github.com/mozcelikors/meta-rover)
Kuksa.docs

More Kuksa layers subject to community
Eclipse (IDE and bindings / libs)
org.eclipse.kuksa
(IDE - plugins and build to support cloud and in-vehicle application development activities)
org.eclipse.kuksa-apps
(e.g. for cloud related components. The initial contribution will contain a Spring Boot application with docker scripts to connect an Eclipse Hono instance with a consumer to allow parsing, storing, and visualizing any registered client's raw data)
org.eclipse.kuksa-hono
(AGL bindings for Hono)
org.eclipse.kuksa-mqtt
(AGL bindings for MQTT)
More binding repos very likely to be required

More Kuksa layers subject to community
Eclipse (IDE and bindings / libs)
org.eclipse.kuksa
(IDE - plugins and build to support cloud and in-vehicle application development activities)
org.eclipse.kuksa-apps
(e.g. for cloud related components. The initial contribution will contain a Spring Boot application with docker scripts to connect an Eclipse Hono instance with a consumer to allow parsing, storing, and visualizing any registered client's raw data)
org.eclipse.kuksa-hono
(AGL bindings for Hono)
org.eclipse.kuksa-mqtt
(AGL bindings for MQTT)
More binding repos very likely to be required

All committer agreed to publish under the EPL.
In-Vehicle developments will adapt to Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) that is partially LGPL and GPL. The Eclipse Kuksa developers will clarify if AGL code can be fully defined as a dependency i.e. that no AGL code must be included in Eclipse Kuksa. However, an adapted AGL build will be secondary licensed
such that the combined work will be licensed under the GPL-2.0, and then distributed as combined work under the GPL-2.0. AGL c
ontent that includes a secondary license clause will link directly with content that is licensed under the terms of that secondary license
(see EPL2.0 FAQ). Secondary licensed build results are not intended to be hosted at Eclipse.
Licenses:
Eclipse Public License 2.0
Project Scheduling:
Initial contribution expected by Q1 2018 (Kuksa 0.1)
Release cycle for the cloud platform is planned every 6 months (Kuksa 0.2 by Q3 2018, etc.)
With the end of the publicly funded APPSTACLE project, the first major release Eclipse Kuksa 1.0 is expected
In-vehicle and APP Dev IDE development activities are not planned yet
Future Work:
Eclipse Kuksa will combine the technologies mentioned in the 'Why Here?' section in order to establish the comprehensive ecosystem that securely allows using vehicle data and transmitting generated cloud results. Concurrent work packages thereby address connectivity challenges, demonstrations, as well as cloud and in-vehicle implementations. By Q4 2018, the infrastructure should be complete and by Q4 2019 the ecosystem should be fluently working with the demonstrators and libraries and APIs should allow tailoring cloud applications towards individual needs.
In order to grow the community around Eclipse Kuksa, its development will be spread across research publications at conferences, workshops, booths, or similar events as well as newsletters around the cloud, IoT, and automotive domains. Consequently, interested and related developers will clearly notice Eclipse Kuksa's benefits and hopefully participate at its open source basis. Already its close relationship with other projects will strengthen Eclipse Kuksa's dissemination. Additionally, the involved partners of the publicly funded APPSTACLE project will utilise Eclipse Kuksa around their developments and include it for customer related projects.

Kuksa-IDE Repo
Che-6
This repository contains documentation and implementation to setup an Eclipse Che (6.10) Kuksa instance under
/che-6/
, which eases the development of Kuksa In-Vehicle applications as well as Kuksa Cloud services. Therefore, the default Eclipse Che version is extended by different Kuksa-specific components:
Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) stack with Yocto support: AGL represents an automotive specific Linux distribution specifically designed as open software stack for connected car scenarios. The following video features an example on how to use the Kuksa-IDE for developing AGL applications and services running on a
Rover
VSCode-Extensions
Additionally, under
/VSCode-Extensions/
, 4 VSCode extensions are provided which ease Eclipse Kuksa In-Vehicle App and Cloud service development activities. Such extensions can be used (a) locally as part of a VSCode instance, or (b) along with Eclipse Che 7 and Theia or (c) Gitpod together with kubernetes and docker (with root privileges) in order to employ a cloud-based IDE. Hence, the set of Visual Studio Code extensions establish an end-to-end workflow from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. The extensions can be installed from .vsix files and provide:
Initialize Workspace
Generate Docker Image
Configure Kuksa Environment(YAML)
Publish to Appstore

About
January 30, 2018
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.
This ecosystem will provide a comprehensive environment across various frameworks and technologies for # the in-vehicle platform, # the cloud platform, and # an app development IDE - that is, the complete tooling stack for the connected vehicle domain (see Figure 1 below). Essential to this environment will be the capabilities for collecting, storing, and analysing vehicle data in the cloud as well as the transmission of diverse information such as cloud calculation results (e.g. improved routing), software maintenance updates or even complete new applications. While many IoT solutions exist in the Eclipse IoT ecosystem, Eclipse Kuksa combines the necessary existing technologies and fills the gaps for the specific requirements of the connected embedded real-time nature of the automotive domain.

Eclipse Kuksa.val DBC Feeder Demo [Video] This demo showcases the features of the kuksa.val (https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val) server.

Eclipse Kuksa.val DBC Feeder Demo [Video]
This demo showcases the features of the kuksa.val (
https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val
) server.
While the automotive world is full of standards, there are not a lot of
useful
standards for an I(o)T world. Useful here means

Standardize on semantics, not technology only
Usable across vendors, by anyone (car manufacturers, suppiers, aftermarket, third parties)
Building on, or interacting with, common IT technologies
One of the more useful approaches in this context is the Genivi Vehicle signal specification (VSS) (
https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification
) . It is a joint effort by different industry players, to provide a useful, generic high-level abstraction of data in a vehicle. The kuksa.val server provides such a VSS data strucuture. To access VSS data, kuksa.val understands a websocket protocol, designed for VSS by the W3C Automotive working group (
https://www.w3.org/auto/wg/
) . Such nice abstract data models and modern protocols are not worth much if you can not connect them to the automotive world. Therefore, the demo showcases, how you can gather data directly from a CAN bus (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus
) and map it to the VSS data structure using a so-called DBC file, which is an old automotive de-facto standard that describes the structure of CAN messages (
http://socialledge.com/sjsu/index.php/DBC_Format
).
