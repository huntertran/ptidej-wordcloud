Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.
This ecosystem will provide a comprehensive environment across various frameworks and technologies for (a) the in-vehicle platform, (b) the cloud platform, and (c) an app development IDE - that is, the complete tooling stack for the connected vehicle domain (see Figure 1 below). Essential to this environment will be the capabilities for collecting, storing, and analysing vehicle data in the cloud as well as the transmission of diverse information such as cloud calculation results (e.g. improved routing), software maintenance updates or even complete new applications. While many IoT solutions exist in the Eclipse IoT ecosystem, Eclipse Kuksa combines the necessary existing technologies and fills the gaps for the specific requirements of the connected embedded real-time nature of the automotive domain.

Eclipse Kuksa Release 0.1.0
Device owners within this environment can select applications over an Appstore and install them on their target device. Such applications can exchange data with or store data in the cloud. Therefore, required software on the device is directly included within images built for (ARM) platforms such as the Raspberry Pi3 via provided build scripts. Furthermore, developers can publish new applications to the Appstore and register new devices for specific Appstore users.

Review Information
The Eclipse Kuksa 0.2.0 release's main focus is on on integrating the cloud and in-vehicle with a holistic authorization and authentication system based on Keycloak. Apart from that, several other interesting features and improvements have been introduced.
The Kuksa IDE now provides typescript extensions to establish an end-to-end workflow in the Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. As the In-Vehicle gateway can be run on different operating systems (Raspbian, AGL, Debian, Apertis, etc.) or hardware architectures (arm64 etc.), In-Vehicle applications will be provided in a generic way via docker images. Therefore, a build script allows to generate target-specific docker images. Based on a generated .yaml config file and a Python-based script, the resulting docker images can then be published to the app store and hawkbit respectively. The typescript extensions can be used in either a local VSCode instance or on cloud-based IDEs such as Eclipse Che 7 (based on Eclipse Theia) or GitPod.

Review Information
The first Eclipse Kuksa Milestone release 0.1-M1 contains:
In-Vehicle repo:
agl-kuksa - Scripts to automate AGL build system with the meta-kuksa layers.
elm327-visdatafeeder - ELM 327 app that reads OBDII data from the vehicle and feeds data to the w3c-visserver.
kuksa-hawkbit - Barebone API for connecting with Hawkbit. Will be shortly replaced with kuksa-appmanager.
w3c-visserver-api - W3C Vehicle Information Specification API.
direct-access-api - Enables sending CAN messages from the cloud to vehicle using Websocket.
datalogger-http - Example app that sends data from the vehicle to an Eclipse Hono instance with http.
datalogger-mqtt - Example app that sends data from the vehicle to an Eclipse Hono instance with mqtt.
remoteAccess - Example app that subscribes to control topic with Hono and receives commands sent.
kuksa-appmanager - Hawkbit appmanager which deploys in-vehicle apps as docker conatiners and more..
email-notifier - Example app that talks to an email-server and sends e-mails to the configured email address. Used at the moment only for internal demos
Cloud repo:
HonoInfluxDBConnector: A Spring-Boot application that connects a running Eclipse Hono instance with a running InfluxDB instance so that messages received by Hono can be stored in InfluxDB. This is especially useful if one wants to easily create a visualization of some measurements eg with Grafana.
AppStore: A Spring-Boot application that connects a running Eclipse HawkBit instance and provides a GUI to manage vehicle (and eventually cloud) applications
Integration repo:
Eclipse HONO API (including MQTT) and Hawkbit API tests.
App repo:
A simple KUKSA app that can send location data to the Traccar GPS tracking suite
IDE repo:
An adapted Eclipse Che stack featuring an AGL and Yocto stacks
Target and YoctoSDK definition possibilities
Build configuration commands for AGL

The Kuksa IDE is now realized as an Eclipse Che Plugin to establish an end-to-end workflow in the Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. As the In-Vehicle gateway can be run on different operating systems (Raspbian, AGL, Debian etc.) or hardware architectures (arm64 etc.), In-Vehicle applications will be provided in a generic way via docker images. Therefore, a build script allows to generate target-specific docker images. Based on a generated .yaml config file and a Python-based script, the resulting docker images can then be published to the app store and hawkbit respectively.

.
Architectural Issues:
The development around the Eclipse Kuksa cloud is so far more a proof-of-concept and not intended to provide a direct production ready and secure deployment.
The integrated services often use the respective standard credentials (e.g. admin/admin)
The Eclipse Kuksa cloud uses certificates from Let’s Encrypt which should be replaced for commercial deployments
Eclipse Kuksa integrates Eclipse Hono 0.8 which is not the newest version
Security Issues:
The default user/password configuration for
AGL image
Appstore
Mosquitto client (no SSL/TLS)
... are in default configuration and not intended for a secure "end product" use.
Non-Code Aspects:
Eclipse Kuksa comes with:
A
project site
containing generic information, a blog, and links to the documentation, repositories, and eclipse representations
An integration repository used for storing build, test, and deployment configuration for CI purposes
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
Not verified
Usability Details:
The usability of Eclipse Kuksa features should be outlined in its corresponding
Readme.md
file
End of Life:
Since this is the first release of Eclipse Kuksa, there are no deprecated or removed features.

Scope:
Eclipse Kuksa unifies technologies across the vehicle, IoT, cloud, and security domains in order to provide an open source ecosystem to developers addressing challenges of the electrified and connected vehicle era. In-vehicle and cloud applications as well as their development infrastructure, maintenance approaches, security, and over-the-air (OTA) update and upgrade management are, with a few exceptions, completely within the scope of Eclipse Kuksa.
Currently, vehicle connectivity applies to mobile networks (and related infrastructure such as clouds, servers, etc.), other vehicles, and local infrastructures (traffic lights, local entities cf. edge computing). Although proprietary approaches provide partial solutions, developers have no access to either open source solutions nor comprehensive ecosystems that allow common connected vehicle development initiatives across suppliers, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and tooling enterprises. Eclipse Kuksa brings comprehensive connectivity solutions to the public while combining diverse technologies of vehicle, IoT, cloud, and security domains.
While safety is out of scope, Eclipse Kuksa addresses maintenance through providing, but not applying, OTA updates or upgrades, Cloud, and in-vehicle applications, as well as state-of-the-art platforms and technologies for in-vehicle communication and data transmission. Demonstration applications will be made available, but sophisticated cloud and in-vehicle applications are generally subject to community or closed-source development processes. Working with this premise, Eclipse Kuksa will support all the necessary development technologies required for such applications.
