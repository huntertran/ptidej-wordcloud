Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.
This ecosystem will provide a comprehensive environment across various frameworks and technologies for (a) the in-vehicle platform, (b) the cloud platform, and (c) an app development IDE - that is, the complete tooling stack for the connected vehicle domain (see Figure 1 below). Essential to this environment will be the capabilities for collecting, storing, and analysing vehicle data in the cloud as well as the transmission of diverse information such as cloud calculation results (e.g. improved routing), software maintenance updates or even complete new applications. While many IoT solutions exist in the Eclipse IoT ecosystem, Eclipse Kuksa combines the necessary existing technologies and fills the gaps for the specific requirements of the connected embedded real-time nature of the automotive domain.

The mission of the top-level project is to provide open source technology that will be used to build IoT solutions for industry and consumers. It will focus on:
Standards and Protocols implementations that can easily be consumed by end solution developers as well as framework developers
Frameworks and Services that abstract the complexity of hardware, communication and data stack manipulation
Tools that facilitate the development of connected systems
Solutions that build ready-to-run solutions based on the other building blocks
This document describes the composition and organization of the project, roles and responsibilities of the participants, and development process for the project.

.
Architectural Issues:
The development around the Eclipse Kuksa cloud is so far more a proof-of-concept and not intended to provide a direct production ready and secure deployment.
The integrated services often use the respective standard credentials (e.g. admin/admin)
The Eclipse Kuksa cloud uses certificates from Let’s Encrypt which should be replaced for commercial deployments
Eclipse Kuksa integrates Eclipse Hono 0.8 which is not the newest version
Security Issues:
The default user/password configuration for
AGL image
Appstore
Mosquitto client (no SSL/TLS)
... are in default configuration and not intended for a secure "end product" use.
Non-Code Aspects:
Eclipse Kuksa comes with:
A
project site
containing generic information, a blog, and links to the documentation, repositories, and eclipse representations
An integration repository used for storing build, test, and deployment configuration for CI purposes
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
Not verified
Usability Details:
The usability of Eclipse Kuksa features should be outlined in its corresponding
Readme.md
file
End of Life:
Since this is the first release of Eclipse Kuksa, there are no deprecated or removed features.
Standards:
MQTT for communication between In-Vehicle platform and Cloud backend

email-notifier - Example app that talks to an email-server and sends e-mails to the configured email address. Used at the moment only for internal demos
Cloud repo:
HonoInfluxDBConnector: A Spring-Boot application that connects a running Eclipse Hono instance with a running InfluxDB instance so that messages received by Hono can be stored in InfluxDB. This is especially useful if one wants to easily create a visualization of some measurements eg with Grafana.
AppStore: A Spring-Boot application that connects a running Eclipse HawkBit instance and provides a GUI to manage vehicle (and eventually cloud) applications
Integration repo:
Eclipse HONO API (including MQTT) and Hawkbit API tests.

The Eclipse IoT Working Group has therefore discussed a more generic, cloud-based IoT platform architecture which better supports the implementation of IoT solutions without requiring developers to solve some of the recurring (technical) challenges over and over again. The diagram below provides an overview of the IoT Server Platform as discussed in the working group.
The diagram shows how devices in the field are connected to a cloud-based back end either via a Field Gateway (e.g. something like Eclipse Kura) or directly to so-called
Protocol Adapters

Data
flowing downstream (left to right) from devices to the back end to a consumer like a Business Application or the Device Management component usually
consists of
a small set of discrete values like
sensor readings
or status property values. In most cases these messages are one-way only, i.e. devices sending this kind of data usually do not expect a reply from the back end.
Command & Control
Messages
flowing upstream (right to left) from back end components like Business Applications often
represent invocations of services
It seems reasonable to assume that the number of messages flowing upstream (Telemetry) will be orders of magnitude larger than the number of messages flowing downstream (Command & Control). The aggregated overall number of messages flowing upstream is expected to be in the range of several hundred thousand to millions per second. Note that in this architecture the same (cloud-based) infrastructure is shared by multiple solutions.
The IoT Connector component provides the central link between the device-facing Protocol Adapters, additional re-usable back end components, e.g. Device Management or Software Provisioning, and last but not least the IoT solutions leveraging the devices' data and services. Solution developers can use the IoT Connector to uniformly and transparently interact with all kinds of devices without the need for caring about the particular communication protocol(s) the devices use. Multiple solutions can use the same IoT Connector instance
running in a shared cloud environment
in order to
. The IoT Connector ensures that only those components can consume data and control devices that have been granted authorization by the device owner. In this regard the IoT Connector can be considered an IoT specific message broker targeted at cloud deployment scenarios.
The IoT Connector component needs to fulfill a set of

, in particular regarding
horizontal scalability
, that are specific to both the deployment environment (cloud) and the intended architectural platform characteristics (as opposed to embedding a connectivity layer into applications individually). However, these requirements are not specific to any particular application domain. From a technical point of view it makes no difference if a sensor reading received via a LWM2M protocol adapter represents a temperature or the relative humidity. In both cases the IoT Connector's responsibility is to forward the messages containing the values to (potentially multiple) authorized consumers without introducing too much latency.
Features at a glance
Secure message dispatching
Support for different message exchange patterns
Used for cloud service federation
Provides interfaces to support implementation of protocol adaptors which allow:
Sending telemetry data
Receiving device control messages (from applications/solutions)
Registering authorized consumers of telemetry data received from connected devices

Scope:
Eclipse Kuksa unifies technologies across the vehicle, IoT, cloud, and security domains in order to provide an open source ecosystem to developers addressing challenges of the electrified and connected vehicle era. In-vehicle and cloud applications as well as their development infrastructure, maintenance approaches, security, and over-the-air (OTA) update and upgrade management are, with a few exceptions, completely within the scope of Eclipse Kuksa.
Currently, vehicle connectivity applies to mobile networks (and related infrastructure such as clouds, servers, etc.), other vehicles, and local infrastructures (traffic lights, local entities cf. edge computing). Although proprietary approaches provide partial solutions, developers have no access to either open source solutions nor comprehensive ecosystems that allow common connected vehicle development initiatives across suppliers, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and tooling enterprises. Eclipse Kuksa brings comprehensive connectivity solutions to the public while combining diverse technologies of vehicle, IoT, cloud, and security domains.
While safety is out of scope, Eclipse Kuksa addresses maintenance through providing, but not applying, OTA updates or upgrades, Cloud, and in-vehicle applications, as well as state-of-the-art platforms and technologies for in-vehicle communication and data transmission. Demonstration applications will be made available, but sophisticated cloud and in-vehicle applications are generally subject to community or closed-source development processes. Working with this premise, Eclipse Kuksa will support all the necessary development technologies required for such applications.
