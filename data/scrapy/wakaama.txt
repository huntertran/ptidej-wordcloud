What is Eclipse Wakaama?
Wakaama is not a library but files to be built with an application. It is written in C and designed to be portable on POSIX compliant systems.
Two compilation switches are used: LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE and LWM2M_SERVER_MODE. Defining LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE enables the LWM2M Client interfaces. Defining LWM2M_SERVER_MODE enables the LWM2M Server interfaces. Both can be defined at the same time.
Wakaama is mono-threaded. An application can call a HandlePacket API to feed Wakaama with received LWM2M packets and a Step API to perform any pending LWM2M operations.
Wakaama provides APIs for a server application to send commands to registered LWM2M Clients. On client applications, Wakaama checks received commands for syntax and access rights and then dispatches them to the relevant objects.
Licenses: Eclipse Distribution License 1.0 (BSD)Eclipse Public License 2.0 Main companies supporting this project over the last three months.
Getting started
Follow the examples
Get the code by cloning the repository.
Wakaama provides sample clients and server in its 'examples' directory. To
try them just launch 'cmake' in any of its subdirectories then 'make'.
You can find detailled instructions in the README at the root of the repository.
You can try the wakaama sample client with the [Leshan Sandbox] by running:
"./lwm2mclient -4 -h leshan.eclipse.org"

Compiling
Wakaama is not a library but files to be built with an application.
Wakaama uses CMake >= 3. Look at examples/server/CMakeLists.txt for an
example of how to include it.
Several compilation switches are used:
LWM2M_BIG_ENDIAN if your target platform uses big-endian format.
LWM2M_LITTLE_ENDIAN if your target platform uses little-endian format.
LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE to enable LWM2M Client interfaces.
LWM2M_SERVER_MODE to enable LWM2M Server interfaces.
LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_MODE to enable LWM2M Bootstrap Server interfaces.
LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP to enable LWM2M Bootstrap support in a LWM2M Client.
LWM2M_SUPPORT_TLV to enable TLV payload support (implicit except for LWM2M 1.1 clients)
LWM2M_SUPPORT_JSON to enable JSON payload support (implicit when defining LWM2M_SERVER_MODE)

LWM2M_SUPPORT_SENML_JSON to enable SenML JSON payload support (implicit for LWM2M 1.1 or greater when defining LWM2M_SERVER_MODE or LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_MODE)
LWM2M_OLD_CONTENT_FORMAT_SUPPORT to support the deprecated content format values for TLV and JSON.
LWM2M_VERSION to specify which version of the LWM2M spec to support.
Clients will support only that version. Servers will support that version and below.
By default the latest version is supported. To specify version 1.0, for example, pass
-DLWM2M_VERSION="1.0" to cmake.
Depending on your platform, you need to define LWM2M_BIG_ENDIAN or LWM2M_LITTLE_ENDIAN.
LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE and LWM2M_SERVER_MODE can be defined at the same time.
Examples
There are some example applications provided to test the server, client and bootstrap capabilities of Wakaama.
The following recipes assume you are on a unix like platform and you have cmake and make installed.
Server example
Create a build directory and change to that.
cmake [wakaama directory]/examples/server
make
./lwm2mserver [Options]
The lwm2mserver listens on UDP port 5683. It features a basic command line
interface. Type 'help' for a list of supported commands.
Options are:
-4 Use IPv4 connection. Default: IPv6 connection
Test client example
Create a build directory and change to that.
cmake [wakaama directory]/examples/client
make

./lwm2mclient [Options]
DTLS feature requires the tinydtls submodule. To include it, on the first run,
use the following commands to retrieve the sources:
git submodule init
git submodule update
You need to install autoconf and automake to build with tinydtls.
Build with tinydtls:
Create a build directory and change to that.
cmake -DDTLS=1 [wakaama directory]/examples/client
make
./lwm2mclient [Options]
The lwm2mclient features nine LWM2M objects:
Security Object (id: 0)
Server Object (id: 1)
Access Control Object (id: 2) as a skeleton
Device Object (id: 3) containing hard-coded values from the Example LWM2M
Client of Appendix E of the LWM2M Technical Specification.
Connectivity Monitoring Object (id: 4) as a skeleton
Firmware Update Object (id: 5) as a skeleton.
Location Object (id: 6) as a skeleton.

./lwm2mclient -b
Simpler test client example
In the any directory, run the following commands:
Create a build directory and change to that.
cmake [wakaama directory]/examples/lightclient
make
./lightclient [Options]
The lightclient is much simpler that the lwm2mclient and features only four
LWM2M objects:
Security Object (id: 0)
Server Object (id: 1)
Device Object (id: 3) containing hard-coded values from the Example LWM2M
Client of Appendix E of the LWM2M Technical Specification.
Test Object (id: 31024) from the lwm2mclient as described above.
The lightclient does not feature any command-line interface.
Options are:
-n NAME Set the endpoint name of the Client. Default: testlightclient
-l PORT Set the local UDP port of the Client. Default: 56830
-4 Use IPv4 connection. Default: IPv6 connection

Wakaama is not a library but files to be built with an application. It is written in C and designed to be portable on POSIX compliant systems.
Two compilation switches are used: LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE and LWM2M_SERVER_MODE. Defining LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE enables the LWM2M Client interfaces. Defining LWM2M_SERVER_MODE enables the LWM2M Server interfaces. Both can be defined at the same time.
Wakaama is mono-threaded. An application can call a HandlePacket API to feed Wakaama with received LWM2M packets and a Step API to perform any pending LWM2M operations.
Wakaama provides APIs for a server application to send commands to registered LWM2M Clients. On client applications, Wakaama checks received commands for syntax and access rights and then dispatches them to the relevant objects.
