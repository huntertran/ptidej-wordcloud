Scope:
tinydtls provides a light-weight implementation of the
DTLS
protocol that can be used in devices with tight memory constraints, i.e. in the order of 100 KiB flash memory and about 10 KiB RAM. The cipher suites supported by tinydtls are limited to
TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
and
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
that are mandatory-to-implement for
CoAP
. In scope:
Integration of new cipher suites as they become available and are recommended for use with CoAP, e.g. the proposed
TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
to achieve forward secrecy in the PSK mode of CoAP.

Implementation of DTLS extensions that are useful in constrained environments, e.g. the maximum fragment length negotiation specified in
RFC6066
.
Provide an interface for using hardware acceleration for cryptographic computations such as AES or ECC.
Include optional
lua binding
for rapid prototyping of DTLS-enabled applications.
Optimize memory usage and runtime behavior.
Improve code quality, including error handling and robustness.
Out of scope:
Development of new cipher suites.
Implementing application logic except for example code that illustrates how to use the library.
Support for CoAP's certificate mode.

Substitution of obolete ECC code (to be replaced by sodium or micro-ecc)
Compatibility:
OIC folks propose API changes to reflect their needs. It is intended to make these changes as little intrusive as possible.

) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section.
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
TZI
began development of tinydtls in 2011 to estimate the memory footprint of a minimal Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) engine. At that time, the Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group in the IETF scrutinized various options for securing the Constrained Application Protocol (
CoAP
). One question addressed the applicability of DTLS together with two new cipher suites that have been proposed for resource-limited network nodes, i.e.
TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
for Pre-Shared Key (PSK) mode, and
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
for Raw Public Key (RPK) mode. As these new cipher suites as well as the use of
raw public keys
in DTLS were still in an early phase of standardization, no known DTLS implementation provided support. It would not have been too hard to enhance existing open source DTLS implementations, though. But in turn, investigating the bare minimum that is required to run a minimal DTLS stack would have implied significant changes to the existing code. Developing the DTLS engine from scratch also allowed to support not only POSIX-compliant systems but also embedded operating systems such as
Contiki
. Since its initial release, tinydtls has become an important tool for experimenting with DTLS in constrained devices by users from academia as well as industry. It has been used as a blueprint and reference platform during development of other DTLS implementations such as

CoAP
. In scope:
Integration of new cipher suites as they become available and are recommended for use with CoAP, e.g. the proposed
TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
to achieve forward secrecy in the PSK mode of CoAP.
Implementation of DTLS extensions that are useful in constrained environments, e.g. the maximum fragment length negotiation specified in
RFC6066
.
Provide an interface for using hardware acceleration for cryptographic computations such as AES or ECC.
Include optional
lua binding
for rapid prototyping of DTLS-enabled applications.
Optimize memory usage and runtime behavior.
Improve code quality, including error handling and robustness.
Out of scope:
Development of new cipher suites.
Implementing application logic except for example code that illustrates how to use the library.
Support for CoAP's certificate mode.

Description:
tinydtls is a library for Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) covering both the client and the server state machine. It is implemented in C and provides support for the mandatory cipher suites specified in
CoAP
.
Why Here?:
Currently, the library is used by
Wakaama
to facilitate security on the transport layer. Wakaama and other CoAP implementations need DTLS support for secure communication at transport layer. Hosting the project at Eclipse can facilitate integration with other projects such as
libcoap
or
Wakaama
. Users that want to use DTLS with their Eclipse projects currently have to do the integration part by themselves. As this is a difficult task, errors that affect the overall security of their projects are more likely.
Licenses:
Eclipse Distribution License 1.0 (BSD)
Eclipse Public License 1.0
Legal Issues:
The library contains an implementation of the Rijndael algorithm (AES) from OpenBSD. The license information is available in the source file
rijndael.c

. The SHA256 implementation included with tinydtls is licensed under BSD (taken from
Aaron D. Gifford
). The implementation of the ECC curve secp256r1 was originally developed by Chris K Cockrum and has been put under MIT license. Additional contributions to tinydtls are from Hauke Mehrtens.
Future Work:
Adding
luadtls
to the [tinydtls] code base.
Integration with
libcoap
Support third-party crypto libraries such as
micro-ecc
API for hardware acceleration
