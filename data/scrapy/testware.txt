It is the aim of the project to supply a rich set of TTCN-3 test suites and test cases for IoT technologies to enable developers in setting up a comprehensive test environment of their own, if needed from the beginning of a project. TTCN-3 has been defined and standardized by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute in ETSI ES 201873 and related extension packages. It is implemented and supported in Eclipse IoT by the Eclipse Titan project.
The initial contribution of IoT-Testware to Eclipse will focus on protocols like CoAP and MQTT. This list will be extended during the project. To ensure test and implementation technology independence, and the test suites will be realized in TTCN-3 and implemented with Titan. The test suites will contain tests for conformance, interoperability, performance, robustness, and security aspects.
Eclipse Titan has already protocol modules for IoT including type systems and codec. IoT-Testware will rely on these type systems and develop codec libraries and test cases based on them.
The IoT-Testware test suites will have a well-defined test suite structure (TSS) and a set of protocol implementation conformance statements (PICS) as well as protocol implementation extra information for testing (PIXIT). The work will follow the standardized approach as defined in ISO “Conformance Test Methodology and Framework” IS 9646 and the best practices as described by ETSI White Paper No 3 “Achieving Technical Interoperability – the ETSI Approach”.

Eclipse IoT-Testware 0.1.0 Release Review
Type: ReleaseState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, January 15, 2020Project: Eclipse IoT-TestwareRelease:
0.1.0
Description: The release 0.1.0 will be the first minor release of the IoT-Testware.
The biggest features are standardized test solutions for the IoT protocols MQTT and CoAP.
Architectural Issues: Originally, the IoT-Testware was a CLI tool only, thus the extensibility and the architectural quality in general was limited. We solved the problem by introducing a simple architecture based on docker. Heart of the docker virtualization is an installation script realized with python. It is open for extensions. A more detailed describtion can be found in our documentation.
Security Issues: There are no concrete consideration made concerning security.
Non-Code Aspects: We would like to list the followng aspects:
Our project documentation
Articles about the IoT-Testware
Our talk at the EclipseCon 2018
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not applicable (project doesn't provide UI)Usability Details: There are no concrete consideration made concerning usability.
End of Life: There are no concrete consideration made concerning end of life.
Standards: Our test solutions, including conformance, performance and robustness (fuzzing), based on the developing ETSI standards delveloped in the WG MTS-TST.
Note: The standards are publicly accessible for ETSI members or as soon as they are in a final stage (arround May 2020).
Communities: We have a strong relationship with the Eclipse Titan project. The IoT-Testware project is using the Eclipse Titan project intensely that is reflected in the Eclipse Titan forum.
Furthermore, we are listed in the following communities:
awesome-mqtt
AIOTI IoT LSP Standard Framework Concepts (sec. 5.3.2)
Additionally, we have shown activities in the MQTT Discussion Group @ Google-Groups.

help command¶
You can refer to the help command if you don’t know how to continue at any point.
Simply run one the following command:
python install.py -h
python install.py --help
The result gives you a first idea, what is possible with the script. The output looks like this:
-h
show this help message and exit
-p PROTO
sets a protocol that will be cloned together with its
dependencies
-b
build the project and create a Makefile
--path PATH
specify optionally your root directory, where all
dependencies will be stored
-e NAME

-v
progress status output is verbose
protocol command¶
The protocol command is the a mandatory flag. It will scan your working directory to check whether all dependencies are met. In case there is something missing, the script will download the missing dependencies automatically.
The command demands a parameter representing the interesting protocol.
Let’s assume you would like to run tests against a CoAP implementation. Run one of the following command to get the CoAP conformance test suite and all it’s dependencies:
python install.py -p coap
python install.py --protocol coap
Use the same procedure for any available protocol.
build command¶
This optional command can be used to build the IoT-Tesware. It builds a Makefile first and creates an executable afterwards. You can only build one protocol at a time. It is determined by the protocol command.
To build the CoAP test suite for example, run one of the following commands:
python install.py -p coap -b
python install.py -p coap --build
path command¶

When you run the install script, it creates a folder structure under ~/Titan by default. This is your base directory where the IoT-Testware and all it’s dependencies are stored:
IoT-Testware
You find the test suites for the protocols you have chosen via the protocol command. It creates a folder for every protocol separately in the form of iottestware.<PROTOCOL>
Libraries
Collection of libraries needed for the specific IoT-Testware protocol.
ProtocolModules
The protocol modules, provided in developer resources, are included inside this directory. The subset of protocol modules are protocol dependent. They define the protocol types.
TestPorts
To bridge the gap between the test suite and the system under test (SUT), test ports are needed. They are provided by Eclipse Titan project.
executable command¶
With this command it is possible to name the executable that is generated when calling the build command. In contrast, the install script chose a default name for the executable following the scheme:
iottestware.<PROTOCOL>
To set your own name for the resulting executable, let’s say “myExecutable” simply run one of this command:

verbose command¶
If you set this command, the console output will be verbose and give you more information during the process. By default, the output is quite, meaning only important messages are shown.
To switch the verbose output on, you add either `` -v `` or `` –verbose `` to your command like in the following examples:
python install.py -p coap --verbose -e myExecutable
python install.py -p coap -b -v
python install.py --verbose --protocol coap

According to the Eclipse’s IoT Developer Survey from the past years, Security, Interoperability and Connectivity are the key challenges for IoT. While these topics constantly rank in the top five, comprehensive open-source solutions are still rare.
This session will introduce the attendees to the roots and motivation of the Eclipse IoT-Testware. Building on this, the major concerns of future IoT will be examined, possible solutions proposed and underpinned with examples.
By accomplishing the session the attendees will be able to overview the problem state and understand the urgent need for open-source testing solutions. Furthermore, such a solution – the Eclipse IoT-Testware – will be put in the attendees’ hands.
Therefore the session will cover the following topics:
Eclipse IoT-Testware
motivation and scope
how to: access and operation
benefits and value of the outcome
The role of TTCN-3 in industry
A link to international standardization

This proposal has been approved and the Eclipse IoT-Testware project has been created.
Eclipse IoT-Testware
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse Technology
Background: The open source community has produced a lot of excellent technology, frameworks and products that help with implementing IoT applications. A developer usually selects an appropriate set of technology and components and incorporates them into an application. The chosen components need to support the implementation of all relevant aspects of an IoT solution including device connectivity, management, monitoring, and business logic and last but not least security enforcement at all levels.
Implementing test suites and cases covering the many aspects, levels, interfaces and protocols ensuring scalability, interoperability and security is a tedious task. There is currently a lot of redundant pre competitive activities ongoing with limited access and impact to the IoT community.
Scope: It is the scope of the project to support conformance, interoperability, robustness, and security testing of IoT devices and services via TTCN-3 test suites and cases. The project should help companies to improve their IoT product quality though sharing of pre-competitive test suites.
Description: It is the aim of the project to supply a rich set of TTCN-3 test suites and test cases for IoT technologies to enable developers in setting up a comprehensive test environment of their own, if needed from the beginning of a project. TTCN-3 has been defined and standardized by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute in ETSI ES 201873 and related extension packages. It is implemented and supported in Eclipse IoT by the Titan project.
The initial contribution of IoT-Testware to Eclipse will focus on protocols like CoAP and MQTT. This list will be extended during the project. To ensure test and implementation technology independence, and the test suites will be realized in TTCN-3 and implemented with Titan. The test suites will contain tests for conformance, interoperability, robustness, and security aspects.
Eclipse Titan has already protocol modules for CoAP and MQTT including type systems and codec. IoT-Testware will rely on these type systems and develop codec libraries and test cases based on them.
The IoT-Testware test suites will have a well-defined test suite structure (TSS) and a set of protocol implementation conformance statements (PICS) as well as protocol implementation extra information for testing (PIXIT). The work will follow the standardized approach as defined in ISO “Conformance Test Methodology and Framework” IS 9646 and the best practices as described by ETSI White Paper No 3 “Achieving Technical Interoperability – the ETSI Approach”.
Why Here?: Eclipse IoT-Testware will collaborate with the Eclipse Titan project as the Eclipse open source solution for executing TTCN-3, even though the project will be TTCN-3 tool independent (and e.g. other tools such as the Spirent TTworkbench could be used instead).
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 1.0Legal Issues: The currently available parts of the implementation and IP are completely owned by Fraunhofer FOKUS and will be made available under EPL according to the Eclipse Foundation regulations.
