Understand Industry devices
Languages of the world
Imagine the following: You go on vacation to a foreign country and want to get by. Usually you will neither have the time nor the resources to learn a new language for each trip. Luckily this is not necessary. A handful of simple phrases such as
hello
,
I am hungry
, etc. are already sufficient to cope with many situations. To have such phrases at hand you don’t need to be fluent in a language, a mini phrase book will already cover a good portion. Thus, to master common situations in different languages you will be well served by a collection of mini phrase books in different languages.
Machines in production
A simple approach to send and understand such industry-specific content implemented for multiple systems would ease the use of the existing Eclipse iot stack and thereby help a lot on the way to a connected industry.
Collaboration with partner
Production Performance Management Protocol (
PPMP
)
Through hands-on experience and collaboration with customers and partners we learned which information is key in understanding industry devices. For example, when sending measurements, the currently produced part or lot number together with machine identification are crucial to get any useful interpretation out of the information.
We started to capture this information in a simple payload specification and just like in the introducing language example where you can use phrases via phone, letter or in person, the payload is meant to be sent over different protocols (REST, MQTT, AMQP). This payload is the Production Performance Management Protocol (
PPMP
).
In order to, first, leverage the Eclipse IoT stack in Industry 4.0 scenarios and, second, build a lively community around the specification, we consider the Eclipse iot working group as the premier place to host Unide.

FAQ
What is Unide?
Noticeably in the recent years, there’s a continuous increase in demand, price pressure and complexity in manufacturing. Things need to move faster, be more flexible, and fulfill higher quality standards. Often, optimization in this regard is referred to as Production Performance Management (PPM). The basis for this optimization is information from the machines and devices related to a product, such as:
Torque and angle for a tightening process
Influx / efflux of throttle plate test station
Energy consumption of spindles in a cutting process
Nowadays, brand new machines and software are often shipped with powerful communication capabilities. For older machines, smaller factories and SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), it can be a challenge to catch up with the complex IT standards that come along. In fact, sometimes the hardware itself imposes limits.
Nevertheless, in a manufacturing environment, monitoring makes most sense if there are no blind spots. To achieve that, upgrading machines and software is one option, retrofitting another. For the latter, the hurdle should be as low as possible. Yet, there should be a few guidelines for a one-way exchange of the most necessary information (machine messages, measurements):
The structure of the data shall be:
flexible enough to be carried via multiple protocols,
in order to not reinvent the wheel and leverage on existing technology

PPMP Specification
Rationale
Noticeably in recent years, there is a continuous increase in demand, price pressure and complexity in manufacturing. Things need to move faster, be more flexible, and fulfill higher quality standards forcing manufacturers to optimize their processes.
Production facilities and their performance have a huge impact on the overall performance of manufacturing processes. However, to identify bottlenecks and possibilities for improvements detailed data from machines are required.
Such data is surely provided by machines either via modern protocols such as OPC UA or via proprietary access methods but it is not provided in a common and easily accessible format, which can be used to do performance analysis and optimization. This renders holistic process improvement efforts infeasible for many, especially smaller organizations.
The Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) specifies a format that allows to capture data that is required to do performance analysis of production facilities. It allows monitoring backends to collect and evaluate key metrics of machines in the context of a production process. It is doing that by allowing to relate the machine status with currently produced parts.
The specification is structured into three payload formats: Measurement payload, message payload and process payload. The Measurement payload contains measurements from machines such as the temperature of a machine at a specific point in time together with the currently produced part. The message payload contains arbitrary messages sent by a machine, e.g. alerts or the like. A process message consists of information about a discrete e.g. tightening or welding process with all their characterizing data, which are needed to describe and analyze it.
The default way of transporting the json payload is via http to allow for an easy integration into various backend systems. Other transportation methods are possible and welcome.
Version 3 is still marked with a star (*), because it is not finally released with server and binding implementations and might be subject to minor fixes (addressed via
github
)

Frequently Asked Questions
We assembled a few frequently asked questions about the Production Performance Protocol (PPMP) and the Unide project. You're welcome to raise your questions in the
Unide forum
.
What does "Unide" stand for?
The projects name is derived from understand industry devices. Other ideas like connect industry machines turned out to have meanings in foreign languages or being trademarked already.
Regarding the logo: Unide and PPMP's goal is to enable you to connect machines and receive their measurements / alerts. The logo represents that. It has you ('
U
') highlighted and connects to rings. As a side note, we found that the words almost look like
you-nice

New Eclipse Foundation Committer and Contributor Agreements FAQ
Resources for Committers
Due Diligence Process:
This document provides a quick pictorial overview of the due diligence process.
Third Party Dependencies:
This document contains the guidelines for the review of third-party dependencies.
Committer Guidelines:
This document outlines the issues to be aware of and the processes one should follow when working as a committer on Eclipse.org projects. A committer is a person that has been granted commit rights to systems on the Eclipse.org servers such as git repositories, web pages, download servers, mailing lists and so forth.
Contribution Questionnaire:
A Contribution Questionnaires (CQ) is the main interface between Eclipse committers and the Intellectual Property Management Team. Prior to committing a significant contribution of content to an Eclipse Foundation project, the committer must fill out this questionnaire and submit it to the Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) for approval. In addition to the EMO, the relevant PMC must also provide a technical review and approval of the contribution. Follow the link to find out more about what we mean by "significant contribution". Bug fixes or minor enhancements do not require PMC or EMO approval.
"About" Templates:
This provides templates for the "about.html" ("About") files used to describe EPL-licensed content.
Default Copyright and License Notice:
The standard copyright and license notice should appear in all source files where possible. Variations on this notice may be required (for example where a license other than the EPL governs the use of the file).
IP Logs:
An IP Log is a record of the intellectual property contributions to a project. This includes such as a list of all committers, past and present, that have worked on the code and (especially) those who have made contributions to the current code base.

Industry benefits of Unide
This open source project aims to make PPM affordable for smaller organizations by reducing cost and complexity of data communication. Through sample implementations of a simple information structure (Production Performance Management Protocol - PPMP) tailored to manufacturing environments, we want to encourage the community to use, share, and evolve this structure together.
PPMP has already been introduced as part of a PPM testbed at a medium-sized Bosch plant, working with many SMEs as partners and suppliers. Furthermore, this testbed aims to create an ecosystem which allows SMEs and larger companies to collaborate efficiently.
The PPMP takes an important role by ensuring interoperability between different types of devices and software. It is designed to gather and aggregate machine and sensor data from different devices. It focuses on defining the JSON payload which can be transferred via a variety of transports (REST, AMQP, MQTT). The primary goals of PPMP are:
Integrating devices (across domains; e.g. manufacturing or energy) for data aggregation and gathering purposes
Providing a very lightweight and easy-to-use solution for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
Scope
The Eclipse Unide project publishes the current version of Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) and develops simple server/client implementations. The implementations store the payloads in a database and displays them through a simple user interface. Everyone can then use these samples for their custom condition monitoring applications.
The project will contain:

Communicating Parties
Two parties are involved in a PPMP message exchange: the sender and the receiver. The sender pushes a message to the receiver. Usually the sender is a machine or a sensor of a machine.
The receiver waits for messages. It offers a API that allows for sending either measurement payloads or message payloads.
The communication is unidirectional. Only the sender can contact the receiver and send messages. No feedback from receiver to sender is provided.
payload
whereas Unide is the project that aims to provide sample implementations and further development of this protocol in and with the Eclipse Open Source community. Nevertheless, PPMP is an open suggestion, and everyone is welcome to using it, even without contributing to the Unide project.
Why introducing another industry protocol?
There are already plenty of transport protocols (REST, AMQP, etc.) available. PPMP aims to provide the very industry specific semantic structure for their payload. So it aims to complete such IoT transport infrastructure and bridge the gap to the manufacturing domain. OPC-DA/UA on the other hand covers full service oriented architecture, security concerns and information model, which makes it more complex and costly to implement and operate. In some use cases, this is not necessary.
Why have you choosen JSON as syntax?
JSON is a good fit regarding understandability and size. Having a structured and comprehensible basis is the first step for acceptance in the industry. In the spirit of Donald E. Knuth ("
premature optimization is the root of all evil
"), further compacting is possible in a later stage.
Why are time and measurement points separated in multiple arrays?
We have discussed multiple options for
series
: having an array of
tupels (
[[0, 23.34],[...],...]
),
plain objects (
),
objects with time as key (
{ "0": [23.34,...],...}
) and other.
When parsing, we had to recognize, that unsigned long int for time and floating point measurements are of different types. Also, all former variants are more verbose due to additional brackets, commas or quotation marks. We believe that the current version is a good compromise between readability and structure.
I'm interested in Unide/PPMP. How can I contribute?
The first goal of Unide is to provide sample client/server implementations of PPMP. Secondly, we're looking forward to improving PPMP in future versions together with the eclipse community.

PPMP Specification:
Machine message and measurement interfaces

Client:
Chrome / nw.js App

Node.js/Python client running on Raspberry Pi
Server:
(REST) Server including persistence and simple data visualization
Multiple examples for different technologies
Description
Eclipse Unide provides a lightweight Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) server-client implementations (using JSON, REST and other). The core of the protocol are two interface definitions:
PPMP Measurement Interface: This is a public REST API with the purpose of receiving time series and machine data.
PPMP Messages Interface: This is a public REST API with the purpose of receiving machine messages.
Why Here?
The PPMP extends the existing Eclipse IoT world by providing an easy and lightweight format for gathering data from industry sensors and machines, focusing on normalizing time series and alert messages. It can be transported by protocols like REST, AMQP, MQTT. As PPMP, these technologies do also not require complex and expensive middleware nor do their systems cause additional license fees. Eclipse is an excellent platform for developing PPMP sample implementations and evolving the format hands-on with the community. In fact, it could even join forces with existing Eclipse IoT projects like

Why have you included content-spec uri, if that can also be expressed in the a REST url already?
content-spec

“Specification Content” is the collection of interface definitions for the application or user interfaces (“Interfaces”) provided by the work to which your Contribution was made, descriptions of the structure and semantic behavior of those Interfaces, and data formats and protocols associated with those Interfaces, all of which as are reasonably necessary to enable the development of independent implementations of those Interfaces. For the sake of clarity, Specification Content does not include implementation detail of how the Eclipse project code or your Contribution implements the Interfaces in the Specification and the Specification Grant provide above would not cover such additional material.
To the extent you submit or otherwise make available to an Eclipse Foundation Specification Project (as that term is defined by the Intellectual Property Policy) any ideas, concepts, methods or other information, you agree that you will not assert, based on such submissions, any intellectual property rights that are essential to any implementation of the submission, against the Eclipse Foundation, its contributors, or its licensees, with respect to any implementation of such Specification (as that term is defined by the Eclipse Foundation Specification Process). To further clarify, such submissions include, but are not limited to, submissions made to any public communications channel such as an email list, forum, or bug report.
To the extent you wish to upload, submit, or otherwise make Non-Code Content (as defined below) available to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site, you may make that material available under the terms and conditions of the EPL or any other license stipulated for that purpose at
