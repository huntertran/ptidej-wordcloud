Understand Industry devices
Languages of the world
Imagine the following: You go on vacation to a foreign country and want to get by. Usually you will neither have the time nor the resources to learn a new language for each trip. Luckily this is not necessary. A handful of simple phrases such as
hello
,
I am hungry
, etc. are already sufficient to cope with many situations. To have such phrases at hand you don’t need to be fluent in a language, a mini phrase book will already cover a good portion. Thus, to master common situations in different languages you will be well served by a collection of mini phrase books in different languages.
Machines in production
A simple approach to send and understand such industry-specific content implemented for multiple systems would ease the use of the existing Eclipse iot stack and thereby help a lot on the way to a connected industry.
Collaboration with partner
Production Performance Management Protocol (
PPMP
)
Through hands-on experience and collaboration with customers and partners we learned which information is key in understanding industry devices. For example, when sending measurements, the currently produced part or lot number together with machine identification are crucial to get any useful interpretation out of the information.
We started to capture this information in a simple payload specification and just like in the introducing language example where you can use phrases via phone, letter or in person, the payload is meant to be sent over different protocols (REST, MQTT, AMQP). This payload is the Production Performance Management Protocol (
PPMP
).
In order to, first, leverage the Eclipse IoT stack in Industry 4.0 scenarios and, second, build a lively community around the specification, we consider the Eclipse iot working group as the premier place to host Unide.

FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions
We assembled a few frequently asked questions about the Production Performance Protocol (PPMP) and the Unide project. You're welcome to raise your questions in the
Unide forum
.
What does "Unide" stand for?
The projects name is derived from understand industry devices. Other ideas like connect industry machines turned out to have meanings in foreign languages or being trademarked already.
Regarding the logo: Unide and Production Performance Management Protocol's goal is to enable you to connect machines and receive their measurements / alerts. The logo represents that. It has you ('
U
') highlighted and connects to rings. As a side note, we found that the words almost look like
you-nice
.
What's the difference between Unide and the Production Performance Management Protocol?
The Production Performance Mangement Protocol (PPMP) is the name of the structure of the
payload
whereas Unide is the project that aims to provide sample implementations and further development of this protocol in and with the Eclipse Open Source community. Nevertheless, the Production Performance Management Protocol is an open suggestion, and everyone is welcome to using it, even without contributing to the Unide project.
Why introducing another industry protocol?
There are already plenty of transport protocols (REST, AMQP, etc.) available. The Production Performance Management Protocol aims to provide the very industry specific semantic structure for their payload. So it aims to complete such IoT transport infrastructure and bridge the gap to the manufacturing domain. OPC-DA/UA on the other hand covers full service oriented architecture, security concerns and information model, which makes it more complex and costly to implement and operate. In some use cases, this is not necessary.
Why have you choosen JSON as syntax?
JSON is a good fit regarding understandability and size. Having a structured and comprehensible basis is the first step for acceptance in the industry. In the spirit of Donald E. Knuth ("
premature optimization is the root of all evil
"), further compacting is possible in a later stage.
Why are time and measurement points separated in multiple arrays?
We have discussed multiple options for
series
: having an array of
tupels (
[[0, 23.34],[...],...]

Production Performance Management Protocol Specification
Rationale
Noticeably in recent years, there is a continuous increase in demand, price pressure and complexity in manufacturing. Things need to move faster, be more flexible, and fulfill higher quality standards forcing manufacturers to optimize their processes.
Production facilities and their performance have a huge impact on the overall performance of manufacturing processes. However, to identify bottlenecks and possibilities for improvements detailed data from machines are required.
Eclipse unide - Welcome
),
plain objects (
),
objects with time as key (
{ "0": [23.34,...],...}
) and other.
When parsing, we had to recognize, that unsigned long int for time and floating point measurements are of different types. Also, all former variants are more verbose due to additional brackets, commas or quotation marks. We believe that the current version is a good compromise between readability and structure.
I'm interested in Unide/Production Performance Management Protocol. How can I contribute?
The first goal of Unide is to provide sample client/server implementations of the Production Performance Management Protocol. Secondly, we're looking forward to improving the Production Performance Management Protocol in future versions together with the eclipse community.
If you want to contribute with source code, use cases or implementing it in your devices, let us know and discuss in the
unide forum
or by forking / filing an issue on
github
.
Why have you included content-spec uri, if that can also be expressed in the a REST url already?
content-spec
is included in the payload, because the Production Performance Management Protocol does not rely on a specific transport protocol (like REST).

Such data is surely provided by machines either via modern protocols such as OPC UA or via proprietary access methods but it is not provided in a common and easily accessible format, which can be used to do performance analysis and optimization. This renders holistic process improvement efforts infeasible for many, especially smaller organizations.
The Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) specifies a format that allows to capture data that is required to do performance analysis of production facilities. It allows monitoring backends to collect and evaluate key metrics of machines in the context of a production process. It is doing that by allowing to relate the machine status with currently produced parts.
The specification is structured into three payload formats: Measurement payload, message payload and process payload. The Measurement payload contains measurements from machines such as the temperature of a machine at a specific point in time together with the currently produced part. The message payload contains arbitrary messages sent by a machine, e.g. alerts or the like. A process message consists of information about a discrete e.g. tightening or welding process with all their characterizing data, which are needed to describe and analyze it.
The default way of transporting the json payload is via http to allow for an easy integration into various backend systems. Other transportation methods are possible and welcome.
Validation
Did you know that you can easily validate your Production Performance Management Protocol payload against the published online version of the Production Performance Management Protocol? For exapmle,
jsonschemavalidator.net
provides an online validation frontend. Just use your payload as JSON input and the respective github link to the Production Performance Management Protocol specification as a

What is Unide?
Noticeably in the recent years, there’s a continuous increase in demand, price pressure and complexity in manufacturing. Things need to move faster, be more flexible, and fulfill higher quality standards. Often, optimization in this regard is referred to as Production Performance Management (PPM). The basis for this optimization is information from the machines and devices related to a product, such as:
Torque and angle for a tightening process
Influx / efflux of throttle plate test station
Energy consumption of spindles in a cutting process
Nowadays, brand new machines and software are often shipped with powerful communication capabilities. For older machines, smaller factories and SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), it can be a challenge to catch up with the complex IT standards that come along. In fact, sometimes the hardware itself imposes limits.
Nevertheless, in a manufacturing environment, monitoring makes most sense if there are no blind spots. To achieve that, upgrading machines and software is one option, retrofitting another. For the latter, the hurdle should be as low as possible. Yet, there should be a few guidelines for a one-way exchange of the most necessary information (machine messages, measurements):
The structure of the data shall be:
flexible enough to be carried via multiple protocols,
in order to not reinvent the wheel and leverage on existing technology
similar in each case,
to be able to use the same software to interpret the data

Communicating Parties
Two parties are involved in a Production Performance Management Protocol message exchange: the sender and the receiver. The sender pushes a message to the receiver. Usually the sender is a machine or a sensor of a machine.
easily understandable,
so that implementation in a custom environment won’t be a hurdle
as simple as possible,
to not produce an opinionated framework
and yet containing enough information for the use cases,
We decided the least common denominator of necessary information are the mandatory fields, common relevant information to be optional, and the possibility for further extension points through metadata.
Industry benefits of Unide
This open source project aims to make PPM affordable for smaller organizations by reducing cost and complexity of data communication. Through sample implementations of a simple information structure (Production Performance Management Protocol - PPMP) tailored to manufacturing environments, we want to encourage the community to use, share, and evolve this structure together.
The Production Performance Management Protocol has already been introduced as part of a PPM testbed at a medium-sized Bosch plant, working with many SMEs as partners and suppliers. Furthermore, this testbed aims to create an ecosystem which allows SMEs and larger companies to collaborate efficiently.
The Production Performance Management Protocol takes an important role by ensuring interoperability between different types of devices and software. It is designed to gather and aggregate machine and sensor data from different devices. It focuses on defining the JSON payload which can be transferred via a variety of transports (REST, AMQP, MQTT). The primary goals of the Production Performance Management Protocol are:
Integrating devices (across domains; e.g. manufacturing or energy) for data aggregation and gathering purposes
Providing a very lightweight and easy-to-use solution for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
Scope
The Eclipse Unide project publishes the current version of Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) and develops simple server/client implementations. The implementations store the payloads in a database and displays them through a simple user interface. Everyone can then use these samples for their custom condition monitoring applications.
The project will contain:

The receiver waits for messages. It offers a API that allows for sending either measurement payloads or message payloads.
The communication is unidirectional. Only the sender can contact the receiver and send messages. No feedback from receiver to sender is provided.

The Production Performance Management Protocol extends the existing Eclipse IoT world by providing an easy and lightweight format for gathering data from industry sensors and machines, focusing on normalizing time series and alert messages. It can be transported by protocols like REST, AMQP, MQTT. As the Production Performance Management Protocol, these technologies do also not require complex and expensive middleware nor do their systems cause additional license fees. Eclipse is an excellent platform for developing Production Performance Management Protocol sample implementations and evolving the format hands-on with the community. In fact, it could even join forces with existing Eclipse IoT projects like

grinding machine is being continuously monitored allowing to have real time
health checks and prevent unexpected failures.
This scenario consists of the following building blocks: device, gateway,
backend. The communication between them happens seamlessly thanks to the
Production Performance management Protocol (PPMP).
The device, i.e. the grinding machine, has been retrofitted with an
acceleration sensor attached to one of its critical components. The data
provided by this sensor is routed to the gateway in the form of a
Production Performance Management Protocol
Measurement Message
.
The gateway receives the raw acceleration measurements, calculates some
statistical characteristics and and applies some machine learning techniques
to them in order to evaluate the condition of the grinding machine. Then both
the statistical values and the condition are routed to the backend, again in
the form of a Production Performance Management Protocol Measurement Message.

Each entry in

This way for example, even small base64 encoded binary data, as send from iolink devices, can be included. 'REF' could be used in multipart messages to reference to other sections or even external content.

$_time

processes
Production facilities and their performance have a huge impact on the overall performance of manufacturing processes. However, to identify bottlenecks and possibilities for improvements detailed data from machines are required.
Such data is surely provided by machines either via modern protocols such as OPC UA or via proprietary access methods but it is not provided in a common and easily accessible format, which can be used to do performance analysis and optimization. This renders holistic process improvement efforts infeasible for many, especially smaller organizations.
The Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) specifies a format that allows to capture data that is required to do performance analysis of production facilities. It allows monitoring backends to collect and evaluate key metrics of machines in the context of a production process. It is doing that by allowing to relate the machine status with currently produced parts.
The specification is structured into three payload formats: Measurement payload, message payload and process payload. The Measurement payload contains measurements from machines such as the temperature of a machine at a specific point in time together with the currently produced part. The message payload contains arbitrary messages sent by a machine, e.g. alerts or the like. A process message consists of information about a discrete e.g. tightening or welding process with all their characterizing data, which are needed to describe and analyze it.
The default way of transporting the json payload is via http to allow for an easy integration into various backend systems. Other transportation methods are possible and welcome.
Validation
Did you know that you can easily validate your Production Performance Management Protocol payload against the published online version of the Production Performance Management Protocol? For exapmle,
jsonschemavalidator.net
provides an online validation frontend. Just use your payload as JSON input and the respective github link to the Production Performance Management Protocol specification as a

html logfile before transformation to the Production Performance Management Protocol
application-context.xml
Main entry file to start camel routes. It contains a general Production Performance Management Protocol validation REST endpoint that reuses the route from
ppmp-validate-context.xml
The backend, usually in the cloud, is any component that "speaks PPMP" and
performs meaningful operations on the incoming messages. Most frequently it
is responsible for storing the arriving data and making it available to apps
that want to consume it. Common responsibilities of these apps are the
representation or display of the data (e.g. dashboards), or workflows
management (e.g. the grinding machine is in bad condition and an inspection
must be carried out).
The backend can be swapped effortless with any entity adhering to the Production Performance Management Protocol standard.
In the Eclipse PPM Testbed at least two different backends have been used:
One directly based on
Unide
One based on
CONTACT Elements for IoT
.
Hands-on demonstration
In order to make this scenario more hands-on and interesting, within the
Production Performance Management Testbed repository
a common definition.json schema is used for sections that are used in multiple telegrams. With the help of JSON schema 'anyOf', sections inherit and can extend from these base definitions.
Next steps
The most recent updates and this post should finalize the v3 schema. Vetos with suggestions that find a consensus fairly soon after posting are stil accepted
via github issues
. Major changes and suggestions should rather be addressed to a v4.
The bindings and server should be updated to accept and validate v3 as well. After updating further dependencies, creating eclipse CQs and undergoing the release process, everything should be wrapped up in the unide release 0.3.0.

open the

remove the

add your own

start a run directly (with bundling to a zip file) with:

gateway.
Grinding Machine simulator
Let's start with the first component. First
cd
to
unide-grinding-machine
and then create the conda environment:
And then in order to use this environment, we need to activate it.
Run
unide-grinding-machine -h
to get familiar with the CLI. With this
executable we can generate some machine grinding data, and (for the moment)
print messages to the console. To do so, run
unide-grinding-machine send random
and you should get a large message on the console. This is the Production Performance Management Protocol
message ought to be sent to the gateway.
We don't have a gateway so far, but don't worry, we will get to that in a
minute. Don't close this console!

and start the server
Point your browser to
http://localhost:8090
and see the servers documentation running on your local server! At this point, Production Performance Management Protocol validation (via HTTP POST to
/rest/v2/validate
) is enabled, but no persistence.
If you want to send data to the server, a quick way is via
Postman App
, which is available as native app or
Chrome app
. Once installed and started, you can easily use the "Import > Import From Link" feature to get the prepared
unide.postman_collection.json
and the corresponding
unide.postman_environment
. You should now have Machine/Measurement/Process messages and requests prepared in the Collections tab. In order to send, you could extend the URL with "/validate" and hit "Send" button. If you get the response
Ppmp Message of type 'xy' is valid
the unide REST server works as expected!

A process message consists of information about a discrete e.g. tightening or welding process with all their characterizing data, which are needed to describe and analyze it.
The default way of transporting the json payload is via http to allow for an easy integration into various backend systems. Other transportation methods are possible and welcome.
Validation
Did you know that you can easily validate your Production Performance Management Protocol payload against the published online version of the Production Performance Management Protocol? For exapmle,
jsonschemavalidator.net
provides an online validation frontend. Just use your payload as JSON input and the respective github link to the Production Performance Management Protocol specification as a
$ref
in the schema. For example:

Measurement Payload
The measurement message is the format to exchange simple (non-structured, non-complex ) measurement data. It also allows to transport multiple measurement data (eg. values over time), called 'series'.
Minimal message example
Multiple message example
http://localhost:9090
and see the
hello world!
in your browser
If you prefer a visual model of these camel xml definitions, you could also make use of
JBoss Fuse Tooling
which is available for
Eclipse Workbench 4.3+
through
the Marketplace
. Be aware that this might cause additional overhead.
JBoss Tools for Eclipse Workbench
If you want to make use of any other of the (as of camel 2.21.0)
281+ components
, you should add the respective maven dependency to the
pom.xml
Gateway simulator
Open a new console, and similarly to the previous point, first
cd
to
unide-grinding-machine-gateway
, create the environment (
conda env create --prefix=env
) and activate it (
source activate env
).
The run the command
unide-grinding-machine-gateway -h
to test that everything
is in place. You should get the CLI documentation.
Now, let's fire up the gateway by calling
unide-grinding-machine-gateway start_server
, and a message like this should show up:
We are getting closer. Leave the gateway running.

Persistence
Influx DB
Download
the InfluxDB Time-Series Data Storage and unzip or install it on your system. By default, it opens an http port at 8086. In order to make use of it, the configuration file should be modified, e.g. to:
After starting the database and the unide REST server, it should be possible to send POST requests to
http://localhost:8090/rest/v2
. This path receives all message types. To query the database after, use:
http://localhost:8086/query?pretty=true&u=root&p=root&db=Measurements&q=SELECT * FROM "ppmp_measurements"
or the other databases that are documented on the
running server instance
, respectively.
SQL (timescale, h2)
Download the appropriate jdbc driver, e.g.
h2-*.jar
, modify the configuration file, e.g. for h2:
Start the Production Performance Management Protocol Server with the jdbc dependency on the classpath, e.g.:
Now, all the data send to the REST server is persisted in the file

Testing
Testing is an important part of the development cycle, especially for the core components that have to work reliably in a production environment.
The project includes example tests in the
src/test
folder:
java
contains the actual java unit tests that make use of
CamelSpringTestSupport
to wire xml CamelContext configuration, test data and expected results together
resources
contains the spring xml configuration that is used by the java test classes and resamble the actual configurations from
src/main/resources
data
contains testdata for the data flows and the transformation
Tests can easily be run from within an IDE (eclipse, visual code studio etc.) or via commandline
You will see the output of the test runs. If it looks like this, it works as expected:
Summary
Communication Device-Gateway
Let's go back to the previous console where we had the
unide-grinding-machine
environment and call again the
unide-grinding-machine
program, but this time
passing the as an argument where the gateway is listening to messages.
If you take peek at the gateway output, you should see new information printed
out, which is a Production Performance Management Protocol message containing the result of the classification
algorithms applied to the device data we just sent to it.
We are getting somewhere! But still, it is not extremely useful to print some
characters into a console, is it?
Communication Device-Gateway-Backend
There is only a small but relevant point missing: the routing from the gateway
to the backend. We need a backend and the Unide project provides a service that
can be used as a playground for these purposes. So let's restart the gateway,
this time passing the Unide endpoint:
test.mv.db
.
For concurrent db actions (reading while writing), use the h2 tcp server instead. h2 is not recommended for production use!

Now we can use the
unide-grinding-machine
to send raw data to the gateway
which in turn sends its results to the backend. In order to be able to
identify this data later, we are going to define a proper device ID (argument
--device-id
), and also tell it to send data once each 10 seconds (argument
--period
):
Once started, a continuous flow of data is pumped through each component until
it reaches the backend, allowing us to use the applications that consume this
data. For instance, the basic backend provided by Unide offers a
Grafana
based
dashboard that offers live monitoring of the statistical values calculated in the
gateway:

Eclipse Unide
publishes the current version of Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) and develops simple server/client implementations. The implementations store the payloads in a database and displays them through a simple user interface. Everyone can then use these samples for their custom condition monitoring applications.
Getting started
For installing the Unide server and binding implementations use Maven.
Installation
Run
mvn clean install
