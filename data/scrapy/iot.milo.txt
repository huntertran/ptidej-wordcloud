OPC Unified Architecture is an interoperability standard that enables the secure and reliable exchange of industrial automation data while remaining cross-platform and vendor neutral. The specification, currently version 1.03, is developed and maintained by the OPC Foundation with the guidance of individual software developers, industry vendors, and end-users. It defines the interface between Clients and Servers, including access to real-time data, monitoring of alarms and events, historical data access, and data modeling.

The mission of the top-level project is to provide open source technology that will be used to build IoT solutions for industry and consumers. It will focus on:
Standards and Protocols implementations that can easily be consumed by end solution developers as well as framework developers
Frameworks and Services that abstract the complexity of hardware, communication and data stack manipulation
Tools that facilitate the development of connected systems
Solutions that build ready-to-run solutions based on the other building blocks
This document describes the composition and organization of the project, roles and responsibilities of the participants, and development process for the project.

Eclipse Milo does have an active user base coming from the original project at "digitalpetri". It was presented as a new project during EclipseCon Europe 2016 and several IoT projects are interested in interfacing or integrating Eclipse Milo.
During the first release a new commiter was added to the project.
Due to the fact that Milo is a library/module with no direct end user involvement it is hard to give any details about end user activities.

Scope:
The project provides:
a stack implementation, compatible with the latest version (1.03) of the UA specifications.
a SDK built on the stack that enables development of compliant UA client and server applications.
The separation between stack and SDK may seem arbitrary at first, but the distinction is common within the OPC-UA community and vendors as it allows SDKs that serve different needs to be built upon a common stack.

Eclipse Kuksa
Internet of Things
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.
