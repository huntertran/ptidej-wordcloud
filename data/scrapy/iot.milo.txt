OPC Unified Architecture is an interoperability standard that enables the secure and reliable exchange of industrial automation data while remaining cross-platform and vendor neutral. The specification, currently version 1.03, is developed and maintained by the OPC Foundation with the guidance of individual software developers, industry vendors, and end-users. It defines the interface between Clients and Servers, including access to real-time data, monitoring of alarms and events, historical data access, and data modeling.

Scope:
The project provides:
a stack implementation, compatible with the latest version (1.03) of the UA specifications.
a SDK built on the stack that enables development of compliant UA client and server applications.
The separation between stack and SDK may seem arbitrary at first, but the distinction is common within the OPC-UA community and vendors as it allows SDKs that serve different needs to be built upon a common stack.

Wednesday, December 21, 2016

Release:
0.1.0
Description:
[1]
will be provided in an Eclipse compliant way.
Milo is an open-source implementation of OPC-UA. It includes a high-performance stack (channels, serialization, data structures, security) as well as client and server SDKs built on top of the stack.
[1]
https://github.com/digitalpetri
Standards:
Eclipse Milo does implement the binary protocol of OPC UA also know as IEC 62541. It will provide client and server SDK beside the core protocol stack.
Communities:
Eclipse Milo does have an active user base coming from the original project at "digitalpetri". It was presented as a new project during EclipseCon Europe 2016 and several IoT projects are interested in interfacing or integrating Eclipse Milo.
During the first release a new commiter was added to the project.
Due to the fact that Milo is a library/module with no direct end user involvement it is hard to give any details about end user activities.
The community is working on GitHub at
https://github.com/eclipse/milo
