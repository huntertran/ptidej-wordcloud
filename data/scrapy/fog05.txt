Early IoT applications, especially those addressing the consumer market, have been embracing cloud-centric architectures in which data is pushed up to the cloud. It is within the cloud the everything takes place before eventually pushing some data or action back to the edge. This architectural approach leverages the availability and operational maturity of the cloud but it is not generally applicable in IoT / Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).
Figure1– Cloud centric architecture.
The cloud-centric paradigm quickly shows its limitations in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and in general with Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). More specifically, the following assumptions, at the foundation of cloud-centric architectures, are generally violated in IIoT applications:
Connectivity. Cloud-centric architectures assume that things are sufficiently often connected. While this is mostly true for IoT applications, it is far from being the common case in IIoT applications. As an example, autonomous agricultural vehicles, or robots in a smart farm are often deployed in locations with very poor connectivity.
Latency. Cloud-centric architectures assume applications can tolerate the latency associated with pushing data from things to the cloud, processing information on the cloud and eventually sending back some control information. This latency, is orders of magnitude higher of the reaction times required by several IIoT applications, such as, autonomous vehicles, smart factories and smart grids.
Throughput. Cloud-centric architectures assume that the throughput required to push data from things to the cloud may be massive when looking at the aggregate traffic, but it is generally composed by limited individual flows. In IIoT the situation is quite different as, often, there are data flows with high individual throughput and in several applications the aggregate volume is incredibly high. This makes it unfeasible or not very effective to stream these massive volumes of data to a data centre.
Cost of Connectivity. Consumer IoT (CIoT) commonly assumes that the cost of connectivity is negligible. This stems from the fact that consumer pays for connectivity – either via their mobile data plan or their home internet connection. In IIoT the situation is completely different, it is the owner of the system that pays for connectivity. This cost is non-negligible in applications with large number of data streams, such as Smart Grids as well as for applications deployed in remote areas such as oil exploitation rigs that can only rely on expensive satellite communication where 1MByte of data can cost as much as $8!
Security. Cloud-centric architectures operate under the assumption that end-users are comfortable in giving away their data. While this may be true for CIoT applications, the situation is completely different in IIoT. Information is a strategic asset which the vast majority of companies, operating in an industrial, do not want to leave their premises.
Fog computing has emerged as an architectural approach to deal with the limitations exposed by cloud-centric architectures in the context of CPS and IIoT applications. fog05 is an infrastructure designed from first principle to address the needs of fog computing.
Figure2– fog05 end-to-end resource virtualisation.
fog05 makes available a set of abstractions to unify the compute, storage and communication fabric end-to-end, thus allowing applications to be managed, monitored and orchestrated across the cloud to thing continuum.
In other terms, fog05 provides the same abstraction of an elastic compute, storage and communication fabric but in a decentralised fashion. The main advantages of this architectural approach, when compared with cloud computing, is the ability to keep the data and the processing close to where it makes the most sense, which in many cases is close to where the data is produced.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the "5" in fog05 beside representing the letter "S" in hackers jargon, it refers to 5G and specifically to Multi-access Edge Computing. fog05 addresses the needs of MEC and is compatible with ETSI MEC manifests.

Both modules provides different abstractions an APIs.
Fog Infrastrucutre Manager
This module virtualises the hardware infrastructure, such as
computational, communication, storage and I/O resources.
It provides key primitives for the management of the infrastructure and
the application deployed in it.
An example on how to interact with the FIM can be found in getting started guide.
It also provide a set of abstraction.
The FIM is designed to be distributed, without any controller node. The system state is managed in a location-transparent manner
leveraging Zenoh for data distribution and sharing across the system.

Scope: Eclipse fog05 aims at providing a fog computing platform that provides the equivalent of cloud IaaS along with some foundational PaaS services.
In other terms, the main focus of fog05 is in providing a scalable infrastructure to:
Virtualise compute, storage and communication end-to-end -- from cloud to thing.
Provide a unified abstraction to provision, manage and monitor applications that may be deployed in the cloud to things continuum.
Provide data virtualisation, as this is a foundational service upon which fog-based analytics, monitoring, etc. will be built.
Whilst monitoring and management is in the scope of fog05, and dynamic resource management is one of the main area in which we plan to contribute, tools for visualisation are out of scope. Third party tools or other projects will leverage fog05 API to provide

Such networks are usually virtualized, and span across different nodes, even end-to-end, they can also be attached to
physical networks.
Router
An Eclipse fog05 router is a networking element able to interconnect two or more networks.
It can also connect a network to the physical networking infrastructure.
Port
A port in Eclipse fog05 is used to represent a network connection between a deployable unit and a network.
Ports are also present in router to connect the router to the different networks, a port can have a floating IP assigned to it.
Fog Deployment Unit (FDU)
In Eclipse fog05 a Fog Deployment Unit, abbreviated to FDU, is an indivisible unit of deployment, such as, a binary executable, a Unikernel,
a container or a virtual machine.
An FDU requires a certain kind of resources as a precondition to its execution.
The life-cycle of an FDU is defined by a Finite State Machine.

We can now clone the Eclipse fog05 repository and build the orchestation engine
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05 -b 0.2.x
$ cd fog05/src/force
$ make
$ sudo install -m 0755 /usr/local/bin
From debian packages
For each release .deb files are generated for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and works also with newer versions of Ubuntu. Those files can be found in the release page on GitHub, and are available for x86_64 and aarch64.
To install the force we can simply run
$ wget https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/releases/download/v0.2.2/fog05-force_0.2.2-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo apt install ./fog05-force_0.2.2-1_amd64.deb
It will create the folder /etc/fos in which we can found the configuration file force.json and the force, and configures the systemd service force to start it.
The configuration file contains the address of the zenoh router used by the orchestrator.
From docker
If you have docker and docker-compose enable in you machine you can download the docker-compose.yaml

Architecture
Instead of relying on a centralized architecture (like cloud-management-systems)
it is based on a decentralized architecture.
Eclipse fog05 allows users to manage and deploy different types of applications,
packaged as containers, VMs, binaries and so on. This possibility is achieved
thanks to Eclipse fog05 plugin architecture.
More specifically, Eclipse fog05 is a Fog Infrastructure-as-a-Service solution
composed by two major components:
The Fog Orchestration Engine (FOrcE)
The Fog Infrastructure Manager (FIM)
These components provides the abstractions to deploy your applications in the
Fog and Edge environment.
Unified abstractions
Common API and information model for management.

Eclipse Incubation
Eclipse fog05 ™ is an incubating project under the Eclipse Foundation.
such as DB servers, controllers and so on.
We made this choice because the problem Eclipse fog05 is trying to address it the management
on the Fog infrastructure which by definition is distributed, heterogenous, mobile and with
intermittent connectivity. This environment has driven all the design choices in Eclipse fog05,
and so in very short time we found ourself with the problem to how access the system state in such environment.
As each node may have intermittent connectivity, can move from one place to another in the system, we needed
a way to provide location-transparent access to the state of each node as well as build the system state starting from
the state of each single node.
We moved towards build all the piece of software in a state-less fashion and leveraging the location-transparency state
access for storing and retrieving state information.
All the state information in Eclipse fog05 are stored in Zenoh a distributed Key-value store, that support location-transparency access,
scalability, URI as Keys, it provides a eventual consistency model and mechanisms to trigger computations (and so build an RPC on top).
How Eclipse fog05 uses Zenoh
In Eclipse fog05 all the components are designed to be state-less, and to store all the information in Zenoh.

Introduction
Location transparent state access and distribution
Hello World!
Edit on GitHub
To kick off our tour of Eclipse fog05 and to demonstrate use and access of the Fog Infrastructure Manager, we will start with the obligatory “hello world”
example.
This example will deploy a docker container that just prints “Hello World!”
Let's get started.
First, we need to install containerdm the containerd plugin for Eclipse fog05 and the fog05 client API.
$ wget https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/releases/download/v0.2.1/containerd.io_1.3.4-1_amd64.deb
$ wget https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/releases/download/v0.2.1/fog05-plugin-fdu-containerd_0.2.1-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo apt install ./containerd.io_1.3.4-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo apt install ./fog05-plugin-fdu-containerd_0.2.0-1.deb
$ sudo pip3 install fog05==0.2.1
Eclipse fog05 provides an unified API for the management of the virtualization infrastructure.
Operating System Plugins
Eclipse fog05 can run on different operating systems, it just need the
right OS Plugin.
Networking Plugins
Eclipse fog05 can manage networking fabrics for which a Networking plugin is
present.
Heterogenous applications
Support of heterogenous runtimes, hypervisors and networking.
Deploy heterogenous applications composed by VMs, containers, ROS2, native applications.
Runtime Plugins
Eclipse fog05 can manage and open-ended set of hypervisors and container
technologies for which a Runtime Plugin was implemented.
Single Descriptor
Eclipse fog05 allows you to define your application in a single descriptor.
No matters if it is composed by heterogeneous components.
Linux bridge with VxLAN virtual networks, and routers in isolated network namespaces.
Runtime Plugin
The Runtime plugin implements the life-cycle management for FDU, is has to strictly follow the state machine defined for the FDU and provide handles for the state management and monitoring for the running FDUs.
Runtime plugins have to implement an interface in order to be recognized by fog05.
In Eclipse fog05 the following Runtime plugin are implemented:
KVM Virtual Machine
Linux Containers (LXD)
Native applications (Linux and Windows)
The following ones are going to be implemented soon:
containerd (docker) containers
ROS2 Robotic framework
Device Plugin
This kind of plugin is the one that abstract the three previous one, and it is designed to allow the deployment and discovery of micro-controller and IoT board that does not have an operating system.
It is difficult to provide a real interface to be implemented for the device plugin, we plan to provide an example implementation for a micro-controller that can be used as base for other implementations.

Information are organized following a tree structure in order to facilitate queries in Zenoh.
State separation
The whole system state is organized in two different portions.
Public State
Private State
Each of them is then distinct in two different sub-portions.
Actual State
Desired State
As you can image from the name Public and Private stores respectively information that can be accessed globally and locally, while Actual and Desired stores respectively actual state information and set-point for the system.
Each of those portion have different read and write permissions, described in the following image.
This separation allows to avoid write concurrency on the Public Actual state as only the node can write is own state, while on the Public Desired this is not an issue as the node will be able to order the requests. Each node owns only its state, the system state is built with the union of the public state of each node in the system.
As a consequence there is no central nodes and each node can act as entry point for the system.
This diagram shows how the agent and the plugins interact through Zenoh.
The agent listen to all the portion of the state, while plugins only listen the private portion, this portion is mainly used for agent-plugin communication, while the public one is used for inter-node and user-agent communication, the agent converts requests coming in the public desired portion to requests to the right plugin in the private desired portion.
As already described in the architecture section, the Zenoh server can be deployed in the same node of the agent or in a another one.
Once it is installed we can use it
From source
Installing the rust environment is quite trival
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs -o /tmp/rust.sh && chmod +x /tmp/rust.sh
$ /tmp/rust.sh --default-toolchain nightly -y
Once we have our rust environment we need to clone the Eclipse fog05 repository and to build fosctl
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05 -b 0.2.x
$ cd src/utils/fosctl
$ make
$ sudo install -m 0755 ./fosctl /usr/local/bin/
From debian package
It is sufficient to download the debian package from fog05's release page and install it.
$ wget https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/releases/download/v0.2.2/fog05-fosctl_0.2.2-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo apt install ./fog05-fosctl_0.2.2-1_amd64.deb
fosctl usage
Use of fosctl is quite easy, you have three base commands add,get and delete that applies to different kind of resouces:
Once it is installed let's start the fog05 services
$ sudo systemctl start containerd
$ sudo systemctl start zenoh
$ sudo systemctl start fos_agent
$ sudo systemctl start fos_linux
$ sudo systemctl start fos_linuxbridge
$ sudo systemctl start fos_ctd
Next we need to write the descriptor for this container.
Let's call it fdu_helloworld.json:
{
"id": "hello-world-docker",
"name": "hello-world",
"computation_requirements": {
"cpu_arch": "x86_64",
"cpu_min_freq": 0,
"cpu_min_count": 1,
"ram_size_mb": 64.0,
Lightweight
Eclipse fog05 is designed to be deployed from big servers to micro-controllers.
Decentralized state
Because Eclipse fog05 uses Zenoh for location-transparency state access and management.
It can be deployed on resource constrained devices and leverage other nodes for state management.
Modular
Eclipse fog05 is built with a plugin architecture and his components can be deployed separately.
Installation
If you want to try Eclipse fog05 you can find installation instruction here
Example
A basic example of an LXD container descriptor that can be deployed by Eclipse fog05
{
"id": "lxd_example_fdu",
"name": "test_1",
"computation_requirements": {
Deployment
All the component of Eclipse fog05 are designed to be deployed in a distributed manner, in order to address the system heterogeneity.
In particular the minimal set to run a fog05 node is to have an agent and a set of plugins running on it, while in the case of micro-controllers the minimal set is composed by only the device plugin. Other components such as the Zenoh routers can be either deployed in a fog05 node or on different machines.
This composable deployment allows to reduce the footprint and optimize the resource utilization of the infrastructure software.
Fog Orchestration Engine
The Fog Orchestration Engine is responsible for the end-to-end orchestration and management of applications and services in the Fog infrastructure.
It enforces the constraints defined by the application/service and provides an allocation algorithm for the components of an application/service.
The FOrcE is designed to work in a decentralized fashion leveraging Zenoh for state distribution and storage.
It is able to instantiate deployments on a Kubernetes cluster hence enabling End-to-End services composed by both fog05's FDUs and Kubernetes deployments.
FOrcE architecture is illustrated in the picture below:
It consist of:
An unified API able to cover both fog05 and Kubernetes concepts.
A Close Loop Orchestration Engine that monitors, schedules and provide a replica-based self-healing mechanism to the deployed applications.
$ opam install dune.1.11.4 atdgen.2.0.0 conf-libev ocp-ocamlres -y
$ opam pin add apero-core https://github.com/atolab/apero-core.git#0.4.6 -y
$ opam pin add dynload-sys https://github.com/atolab/apero-core.git#0.4.6 -y

$ opam pin add zenoh-proto https://github.com/atolab/zenoh.git#0.3.0 -y
$ opam pin add zenoh-ocaml https://github.com/atolab/zenoh.git#0.3.0 -y
$ opam pin add yaks-common https://github.com/atolab/yaks-common.git#0.3.0 -y
$ opam pin add yaks-ocaml https://github.com/atolab/yaks-ocaml.git#0.3.0 -y
$ opam pin add fos-sdk https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/sdk-ocaml.git#0.2.x -y
$ opam pin add fos-fim-api https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/api-ocaml.git#0.2.x -y
Then we need to get the Eclipse Zenoh daemon, fog05 uses version 0.3.0 building instruction can be found here
We can now clone the Eclipse fog05 agent repository and build and install the agent
Theme: Tokio website theme
Tree structure
We said that the state is organized as a tree structure, this helps in the separation of the state of each node and in the definition on the storage and URIs to be used in Zenoh.
There are a total of four different trees, organized in two groups.
Public trees
Private trees
Trees in the same group differs only for the first portion of the URI, while between different groups the tree structure is different.
Below you can find the structures
Public
--- [a|d]gfos
|--- <system id>
|---- users
| |--- <user id>
| |--- info
|
|--- configuration
fim
cloud
entity
instance
The help can be issued by fosctl -h and it provides information for each command and each resource.
Let's add a new FIM to our orchestation engine.
$ fosctl add fim 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 tcp/192.168.122.206:7447
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
FIM Operations
We need to pass the UUIDv4 of the FIM we want to add (it is used to identify the FIM by the orchestartor) and the locator to access the Zenoh of that FIM
We can also list the available FIMs
$ fosctl get fim
+--------------------------------------+
| UUID |

$ sudo make install
The installation creates the folder /etc/fos in which we can found the configuration file agent.json and the agent itself. It creates as well the systemd files for starting and stopping the service fos_agent
After installing the agent is required to install at least the OS, Network Manager and one FDU plugin.
Linux Plugin
To install the OS plugin, we need Python3 and a set of dependencies
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-pip cmake build-essential python3-lxml
$ git clone https://github.com/atolab/zenoh-c -b 0.3.0 && cd zenoh && make && sudo make install && cd ..

$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/sdk-python -b 0.2.x cd sdk-python && make && sudo make install && cd ..
Then we can clone and install the Linux Plugin
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/plugin-os-linux -b 0.2.x
$ cd plugin-os-linux

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
And finally we can remove a FIM
$ fosctl delete fim 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Cloud Operations
We can also add a Cloud site, which is a Kubernetes cluster, let's do this
import time
from fog05 import FIMAPI
from fog05_sdk.interfaces.FDU import FDU
def read_file(filepath):
with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
data = f.read()
return data

We can add an new entity to the catalog, some examples can be found here
$ fosctl add entity entity.json
3c02af14-5826-449f-bfaa-9a8dd54d04ff
We can list available entities
$ fosctl get entity
+--------------------------------------+----------------+
| Entity UUID | ID |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+
| 3c02af14-5826-449f-bfaa-9a8dd54d04ff | example-entity |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+
We can ask for detailed information about an entity
$ fosctl get entity 3c02af14-5826-449f-bfaa-9a8dd54d04ff
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------+---------+
| UUID | ID | Name | Version |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------+---------+
| 3c02af14-5826-449f-bfaa-9a8dd54d04ff | example-entity | example simple entity | 0.0.1 |
api.fdu.terminate(inst_info.get_uuid())
api.close()
exit(0)
We can save this file as fos_deploy.py and run it using python3
$ python3 fos_deploy.py

Eclipse Incubation
All new projects start in the incubation phase (a project in the incubation phase is said to be incubating). The classification of a project in the incubation phase is not a statement about the quality of the project’s code; rather, the incubation phase is more about the project team’s progress in practicing the open and public processes necessary to establish the three communities (developers, adopters, and users) around the project.

Eclipse fog05 with ETSI OSM Orchestrator
Edit on GitHub
Eclipse fog05 is compatible with ETSI OSM, and can be used as a VIM by this one.
Current interoperability is limited to simple NS using LXD containers as VNFs.
Let's suppose we have a multi node fog05 deployment and we want to connect this deployment to OSM to instantiate VNFs.
First let's add the VIM account to OSM
Following paramater can be added
arch cpu architecture used when creating the VDUs for this VIM account eg. x86_64, aarch64, default is x86_64.
hypervisor hypervisor supported by this VIM account, can be one of: LXD, KVM, BARE, DOCKER, ROS2, at least one node of the system as to be able to manage the selected hypervisor, currently only LXD is supported within the OSM connector.

Instance operations
Once we have added an entity we usually want to instantiate it.
So we can add an instance for a given entity specifing the FIM and/or Cloud in which we want to instantiate
fosctl add instance -f 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 54435d55-ba1f-408e-99ac-f8209d79c7ef
dfb3b37e-0036-4778-8e1d-12bbb37a1570
In this case we are just specifing the FIM where to instantiate, the cloud will be passed using the -c flag.
We can look at the status of this instance
$ fosctl get instance dfb3b37e-0036-4778-8e1d-12bbb37a1570
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------+-------+

Ok, I used 0.2.1 but I will try with 0.2.0
Mario Mesas
@marzmesas
Awesome
According to version 0.2.0, there should not be any problem with OSM instantiation
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
that should be the case, but the OSM connector was updated before the release of 0.2.1

Write a Runtime Plugin
Edit on GitHub
Runtime Plugin
The Runtime plugin implements the life-cycle management for FDU, is has to strictly follow the state machine defined for the FDU and provide handles for the state management and monitoring for the running FDUs.
This picture represent the state machine that an FDU has to follow.
States
Each FDU can be in one of those nine states:
UNDEFINED
Images need to be already present at the VIM.
Example NS
Here you can find and example of network service that can be instantiated to the Eclipse fog05 VIM using OSM.
The network service is composed by a single VNF based on an Alpine Linux LXD image.
alpine-vnfd.yaml
vnfd:vnfd-catalog:
vnfd:
- id: alpine_vnfd
name: alpine_vnf
short-name: alpine_vnf

In this state the FDU is registered in the catalog but there are no instances in the system
DEFINED
In this state a FDU instance was created in a node, but it is only created, meaning that an instance UUID was assigned to it.
CONFIGURE
The FDU instance was configured in a node, the image was fetched, resources allocated, and the instance was defined in the underlying hypervisor/container engine.
Or in case of native application the namespace was created.
RUNNING
The FDU instance is started, the instance is started in the underlying hypervisor/container engine or the native application process is started.

Sure, if you manage to succeed please let me know
I'll just follow your steps to check what I missed
Mario Mesas
@marzmesas
Hi Gabriele, were you able to instantiate with 0.2.0?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
I’m working on it, I had some issues with the testing infrastructure
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Just forgot to mention you have to change the address in the script that creates the VIM
tested with 0.2.1 and indeed it seems that there is a timer, btw with 0.2.1 you can just use OSM to check if the service is up, it takes around 1min to update the information from the VIM
The output should be osm ns-list

Monitoring of the instance begin at this stage.
MIGRATING
The FDU instance is instructed for migration, this leads to two different states on the source and destination node.
Source node instance transits to TAKE_OFF, when it is ready for migration, while destination instance transits to LANDING when ready for migration.
After migration the instance in the source node is destroyed, while in destination node the instance is in RUNNING state.
Migration is supported only for collaborative FDUs.
PAUSE
The execution of the instance is freezed. This state is supported only for certain FDUs.
SCALING
The instance is scaled up or down. This state is supported only for certain FDUs.

Hi all, if I want to deploy an nginx web server from Dockerhub on fog05, what would be the steps ? :)so that I can use the webserver at the end.
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Hi @meeeehdiiii_twitter, if you already followed the “Hello World” example you can have your FDU descriptor based on the one of the example, just need to point to the right image from dockerhub, this means updating the uri in the image section of the descriptor to your image on dockerhub eg. in the case of the simple alpine:nginx image it would become like this …
“image”:{
“uri”:””docker.io/library/nginx:alpine”,
"checksum": "",
"format": “"
}

State transitions
The Runtime plugin has to implement state transition for the FDU is able to manage.
define_fdu
It takes as parameter the FDU instance record and create the instance in the node.
In case of success updates the status using update_fdu_status
In case of error returns an error using write_fdu_error
undefine_fdu
Takes the instance UUID as parameter and destroy the instance from the node.
In case of success updates the status using update_fdu_status
In case of error returns an error using write_fdu_error
configure_fdu
Takes the instance UUID as parameter and create all the resources needed for the execution of the FDU, creates the instance in the hypervisor/container engine if needed, creates the needed networking
components by calling the Network Manager plugin.
In case of success updates the status using update_fdu_status
In case of error returns an error using write_fdu_error

If you want your fog05 installation to be able to use VLANs for virtual networks instead of overlay VxLANs you need to change the configuration on all nodes.

Then to use it you need to attach that fdu to a virtual network managed by fog05.Like you can see in this demo: https://github.com/atolab/eclipse-fog05-ros2-demo
Mehdi
@meeeehdiiii_twitter
@gabrik Thanks, I tried both (nginx, and ros2-demo) but it was not successfull yet.when I try to run the ros2-demo, I get "No Nodes in the system".or I get "Error 404 with message No node found for this FDU" when I use the Linux zenoh.service daemon instead of the eclipse/zenoh docker image. The error comes from this line: inst_info = a.fdu.define(fdu_id)And I start the script with python3 deploy.py localhost:7447I have the following components running on my LinuxMint:fos_agent , fos_ctd, fos_linux, fos_linuxbridge, containerd, zenohDo I have all required components to run the ros2-demo or do I need additional components/ nodes ?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
For the ROS2 demo you need to install ROS2 and the ROS2 plugin. But as you plan to just unse nginx you do not need to run all the ROS2 demo, it is just a good starting point to see how to describe a virtual network and the FDUs attached to that.The error you get seems related at the failing of some check during the instantiation process.Can you check the output of journalctl -u fos_agent | grep eval_check_fdu when you get the error?

@meeeehdiiii_twitter
Is this documentation still valid? https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/wiki/InstallationI wanted to install the CLI but cannot find the install scripts...Can the CLI already be used to deploy microservices?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
The CLI is not valid anymore, the only way to interact is using the APIs that are available in Go, Python3 and OCaml
We are working in the rewrite of the code base and thus tools like the CLI will be developed while rewriting

Hi @gabrik, I have a problem with containerd migration as the migration command never completes. I have two nodes that can both run my test container but when I execute the migration the command is stuck. >>> api.fdu.migrate(inst_info.get_uuid(),'9806ff42-cecc-48c1-9f44-da51955d4732')

Hi again, do you guys have a web server as an example application which can run on top of fog05 ? I didn't manage to do it with Docker and nginx...( Is it possible with any other virtualization technoloy which is tested already? )
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
You can use an LXD container with nginx and everything should be fine

GitHub - eclipse-fog05/sdk-go: sdk for go plugins
@meeeehdiiii_twitter
@gabrik I am pretty new to lxd. Does it mean it would have to pull, and run an lxd, then install nginx inside it. And then create a tarball. and this tarball can then be used in the deployment file for fog05 ?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Yes exactly
Mehdi
@meeeehdiiii_twitter
@gabrik okey thank you! I will try that later. I like the plugin mechanisms of fog05 a lot and that different virtualization technologies can run on fog05 just with a plugin and if the node supports that technology. I have some other questions regarding fog05 principles:
Currently, there is the LinuxBridge network plugin. Is the communication of distributed applications on different nodes in different physical networks a relevant and important topic for fog05 ? The LinuxBridges on both edge nodes have to find themselves over e.g. VPN in order to support distributed communication, right? Another approach would be to let them communicate over a centralized controlplane. But there will be no contralized controlplane. And fog05 mentions just layer2-networking, but no overlay networking. Is distributed communication out of scope of fog05 ?
except the plugin-net-linuxbridge, are there any other networks plugins that fog05 plans to support later?

@gabrik Thanks for the hints. I am currently writing my master thesis about cloud/edge computing topics; and fog05 has interesting topics.
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Hi all,we are happy to announce fog05 version 0.2.2 that comes with:
Decentralized Orchestration Engine!
K8s interoperability
A new and shiny fosctl utility that allows deployments on both fog05 and K8s clusters!
More details on fosclt can be found here: https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/introducing-fosctl/While installation instruction for the orchestration engine are available here: https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/force-installation/

Hi @gabrik I think there is some problem during the installation of the native plugin: running a native application doesn't work and I get this error message in the log "sudo: fos_containerize: command not found". I checked the binary in /usr/bin and its size is 0. Replacing it with the correct file as written in the Makefile (sudo ln -sf /etc/fos/plugins/plugin-fdu-native/utils/containerize /usr/bin/fos_containerize) makes the native plugin work again.Also, I cannot seem to get a connection to the internet from within a native application run through fog05 but I remember that a few months I was able to: has something changed?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Hi @marcogozzi thanks for reporting this, I guess there is an error in the makefile/debian file.Regarding connectivity issue, by default the native plugin isolates the binaries in a separate namespace, so network is isolated if not connected to a virtual network that then is able to reach the internet or bridged to an existing virtual bridge.You can disable isolation, it is a configuration flag in /etc/fos/plugins/plugin-fdu-native/native_plugin.json just changing isolation to false

Thanks, I didn't notice that flag.By the way, I think there is a similar issue with the linux net plugin as the file /urs/bin/fos_get_address also has size 0 and it is created by another Makefile. I hope it can help you fix the problem.
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Indeed both should be links to the binaries inside the plugin directory, with a quick check the fos_containerize link is broken, while the other one seems fine. Will fix this ASAP
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
@marcogozzi the issue is solved for both native and linuxbridge plugin, you can find the latest releases here: https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/plugin-fdu-native/releases/tag/v0.2.2 and here: https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/plugin-net-linuxbridge/releases/tag/v0.2.2

Hi @afzalj-t you can just install it from the .deb files that you can found here: https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/releases/tag/v0.2.2There also a guide in the docs: https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/installation/#from-debian-packages While debugging can be done using the system log, journalctl -u <fog05 component> -f the fog05 components depends on the component you have installed

Type: CreationState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, May 16, 2018Project: Eclipse fog05Proposal:
Eclipse fog05
fog05 has been designed from first principle to address the requirements characteristic of fog and multi-access edge computing (MEC). fog05 provides a decentralised infrastructure that unifies computing, networking and storage fabrics end-to-end, while addressing the challenges imposed by resource heterogeneity.
Finally, it is worth point out that fog05 has leveraged of the experience we have gained through our experience with fog computing which dates back to its inception. As an example, we were part of the team that in 2015 demonstrated the first fog computing platform operting smart cities services in Barcelona.
Scope: Eclipse fog05 aims at providing a fog computing platform that provides the equivalent of cloud IaaS along with some foundational PaaS services.
In other terms, the main focus of fog05 is in providing a scalable infrastructure to:
Virtualise compute, storage and communication end-to-end -- from cloud to thing.
Provide a unified abstraction to provision, manage and monitor applications that may be deployed in the cloud to things continuum.
Provide data virtualisation, as this is a foundational service upon which fog-based analytics, monitoring, etc. will be built.
Whilst monitoring and management is in the scope of fog05, and dynamic resource management is one of the main area in which we plan to contribute, tools for visualisation are out of scope. Third party tools or other projects will leverage fog05 API to provide
Description: Early IoT applications, especially those addressing the consumer market, have been embracing cloud-centric architectures in which data is pushed up to the cloud. It is within the cloud the everything takes place before eventually pushing some data or action back to the edge. This architectural approach leverages the availability and operational maturity of the cloud but it is not generally applicable in IoT / Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).
Figure1– Cloud centric architecture.
The cloud-centric paradigm quickly shows its limitations in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and in general with Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). More specifically, the following assumptions, at the foundation of cloud-centric architectures, are generally violated in IIoT applications:

Description: Eclipse fog05 allows the end-to-end management of compute, storage, networking and I/O fabric in the Edge and Fog Environment. Instead of relying on a centralized architecture (like cloud-management-systems) it is based on a decentralized architecture.
Eclipse fog05 allows users to manage and deploy different types of applications, packaged as containers, VMs, binaries and so on. This possibility is achieved thanks to Eclipse fog05 plugin architecture.
Support for:
- LXD containers
- KVM virtual machines
- native applications
- docker containers (experimental)
API and SDK available in:
- OCaml
- Python 3
- Go
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verified

Issues
Connectivity. Cloud-centric architectures assume that things are sufficiently often connected. While this is mostly true for IoT applications, it is far from being the common case in IIoT applications. As an example, autonomous agricultural vehicles, or robots in a smart farm are often deployed in locations with very poor connectivity.
Latency. Cloud-centric architectures assume applications can tolerate the latency associated with pushing data from things to the cloud, processing information on the cloud and eventually sending back some control information. This latency, is orders of magnitude higher of the reaction times required by several IIoT applications, such as, autonomous vehicles, smart factories and smart grids.
Throughput. Cloud-centric architectures assume that the throughput required to push data from things to the cloud may be massive when looking at the aggregate traffic, but it is generally composed by limited individual flows. In IIoT the situation is quite different as, often, there are data flows with high individual throughput and in several applications the aggregate volume is incredibly high. This makes it unfeasible or not very effective to stream these massive volumes of data to a data centre.
Cost of Connectivity. Consumer IoT (CIoT) commonly assumes that the cost of connectivity is negligible. This stems from the fact that consumer pays for connectivity – either via their mobile data plan or their home internet connection. In IIoT the situation is completely different, it is the owner of the system that pays for connectivity. This cost is non-negligible in applications with large number of data streams, such as Smart Grids as well as for applications deployed in remote areas such as oil exploitation rigs that can only rely on expensive satellite communication where 1MByte of data can cost as much as $8!
Security. Cloud-centric architectures operate under the assumption that end-users are comfortable in giving away their data. While this may be true for CIoT applications, the situation is completely different in IIoT. Information is a strategic asset which the vast majority of companies, operating in an industrial, do not want to leave their premises.
Fog computing has emerged as an architectural approach to deal with the limitations exposed by cloud-centric architectures in the context of CPS and IIoT applications. fog05 is an infrastructure designed from first principle to address the needs of fog computing.
Figure2– fog05 end-to-end resource virtualisation.
fog05 makes available a set of abstractions to unify the compute, storage and communication fabric end-to-end, thus allowing applications to be managed, monitored and orchestrated across the cloud to thing continuum.
In other terms, fog05 provides the same abstraction of an elastic compute, storage and communication fabric but in a decentralised fashion. The main advantages of this architectural approach, when compared with cloud computing, is the ability to keep the data and the processing close to where it makes the most sense, which in many cases is close to where the data is produced.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the "5" in fog05 beside representing the letter "S" in hackers jargon, it refers to 5G and specifically to Multi-access Edge Computing. fog05 addresses the needs of MEC and is compatible with ETSI MEC manifests.
Why Here?: ADLINK has taken the corporate decision of supporting Eclipse and creating an ecosystem of technologies for edge/fog computing in the context of Eclipse IoT. Eclipse Cyclone was the first step in that direction, fog05 is the logical consequence.
When evaluating the different open source foundations, we selected Eclipse and specifically Eclipse IoT because of its focus on IoT, its transparent community approach and its extremely active marketing.
Initial Contribution: fog05 is already a usable fog infrastructure. Its code base is avilable at https://github.com/atolab/fog05

Status message
This proposal has been approved and the Eclipse fog05 project has been created.
Eclipse fog05
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse IoT
fog05 has been designed from first principle to address the requirements characteristic of fog and multi-access edge computing (MEC). fog05 provides a decentralised infrastructure that unifies computing, networking and storage fabrics end-to-end, while addressing the challenges imposed by resource heterogeneity.
Finally, it is worth point out that fog05 has leveraged of the experience we have gained through our experience with fog computing which dates back to its inception. As an example, we were part of the team that in 2015 demonstrated the first fog computing platform operting smart cities services in Barcelona.
Scope: Eclipse fog05 aims at providing a fog computing platform that provides the equivalent of cloud IaaS along with some foundational PaaS services.
In other terms, the main focus of fog05 is in providing a scalable infrastructure to:
Virtualise compute, storage and communication end-to-end -- from cloud to thing.
Provide a unified abstraction to provision, manage and monitor applications that may be deployed in the cloud to things continuum.
Provide data virtualisation, as this is a foundational service upon which fog-based analytics, monitoring, etc. will be built.
Whilst monitoring and management is in the scope of fog05, and dynamic resource management is one of the main area in which we plan to contribute, tools for visualisation are out of scope. Third party tools or other projects will leverage fog05 API to provide
Description: Early IoT applications, especially those addressing the consumer market, have been embracing cloud-centric architectures in which data is pushed up to the cloud. It is within the cloud the everything takes place before eventually pushing some data or action back to the edge. This architectural approach leverages the availability and operational maturity of the cloud but it is not generally applicable in IoT / Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).

fog05 has also dependencies on other Open Source projects that we run. Some of these projects are not yet part for eclipse and we plan to contribute them as fog05 sub-projects, other may naturally become part of Eclipse Cyclone. These are:
- Eclipse Cyclone
- Eclipse Cyclone Python API http://github.com/atolab/python-cdds/
- Eclipse Cyclone OCaml API http://github.com/atolab/ocaml-cdds
- DStore http://github.com/atolab/python-dstore/
fog05 core is written on OCaml and Python.
Legal Issues: To the best of our knowledge fog05 name or trademark is not owned by any party.
We own the domain fog05.io and agree to transfer it to Eclipse by submiting the proper transfer agreement.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 2.0Project Scheduling: As we are already running and Open Source project we are ready to do the initial contribution immediately.
Future Work: Our main areas of focus are the following:
- fog05 Agent: We are rewriting the core of the agent in OCaml in order to improve performance, security and to allow for deployments on the MirageOS (http://mirage.io) unikernel. This kind of deployment (depicted below), will allow us to have an extremely small surface of attack. For those of you that are not aware of the MirageOS they have had a bit-coin challenge for a few years and nobody has managed to hack into this unikernel yet.
- Plugin API: Currently fog05 plugins are written in python. We are working to make it possible for user to write a plugin in any programming language they wish to.
- Distributed Store (DStore): We are also re-writing the distributed store implementation in OCaml to improve performance, security and safety compared to the current version written in python.
- Dynamic Resource Management: fog05 currently uses a first-fit algorithm to place deployable entities on available resources. We plan to work on optimisation algorithms to improve the placement strategy and potentially dynamically adapt it.

Figure1– Cloud centric architecture.
The cloud-centric paradigm quickly shows its limitations in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and in general with Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). More specifically, the following assumptions, at the foundation of cloud-centric architectures, are generally violated in IIoT applications:
Connectivity. Cloud-centric architectures assume that things are sufficiently often connected. While this is mostly true for IoT applications, it is far from being the common case in IIoT applications. As an example, autonomous agricultural vehicles, or robots in a smart farm are often deployed in locations with very poor connectivity.

Cloud-centric architectures assume applications can tolerate the latency associated with pushing data from things to the cloud, processing information on the cloud and eventually sending back some control information. This latency, is orders of magnitude higher of the reaction times required by several IIoT applications, such as, autonomous vehicles, smart factories and smart grids.

In IIoT the situation is quite different as, often, there are data flows with high individual throughput and in several applications the aggregate volume is incredibly high. This makes it unfeasible or not very effective to stream these massive volumes of data to a data centre.
Cost of Connectivity. Consumer IoT (CIoT) commonly assumes that the cost of connectivity is negligible. This stems from the fact that consumer pays for connectivity – either via their mobile data plan or their home internet connection. In IIoT the situation is completely different, it is the owner of the system that pays for connectivity. This cost is non-negligible in applications with large number of data streams, such as Smart Grids as well as for applications deployed in remote areas such as oil exploitation rigs that can only rely on expensive satellite communication where 1MByte of data can cost as much as $8!

The Open Fog Consortium is currently considering to adopt fog05 as the reference implementation of the reference architecture and as one of the fog plarforms to use in fog testbeds.
ITRI (https://www.itri.org.tw/eng/)
ITRI is a the biggest Taiwanese Governmental R&D centre, whose mission is to accelerate innovation and technology adoption. ITRI has adopted fog05 for all fog computing, MEC and 5G initiatives.
UC3M (https://www.uc3m.es/Home)
The networking and edge computing group at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, leader by professors Arturo Azcorra and Antonio Oliva, are actively collaborating with us and contributing to fog05.
5G Coral EU Project
The 5G Coral EU project has adopted fog05 as the infrastructure for MEC and its actively contributing to its R&D.
Huawei
fog05 along and some of the services provided such as its decentralised key/value store are of extreme interest to Huawei Corporate R&D. Huawei has been actively discussing requirements and directions of these technologies.

fog05 node agent
Why Here?: ADLINK has taken the corporate decision of supporting Eclipse and creating an ecosystem of technologies for edge/fog computing in the context of Eclipse IoT. Eclipse Cyclone was the first step in that direction, fog05 is the logical consequence.
When evaluating the different open source foundations, we selected Eclipse and specifically Eclipse IoT because of its focus on IoT, its transparent community approach and its extremely active marketing.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 2.0Legal Issues: To the best of our knowledge fog05 name or trademark is not owned by any party.
We own the domain fog05.io and agree to transfer it to Eclipse by submiting the proper transfer agreement.
Project Scheduling: As we are already running and Open Source project we are ready to do the initial contribution immediately.
Future Work: Our main areas of focus are the following:
- fog05 Agent: We are rewriting the core of the agent in OCaml in order to improve performance, security and to allow for deployments on the MirageOS (http://mirage.io) unikernel. This kind of deployment (depicted below), will allow us to have an extremely small surface of attack. For those of you that are not aware of the MirageOS they have had a bit-coin challenge for a few years and nobody has managed to hack into this unikernel yet.
- Plugin API: Currently fog05 plugins are written in python. We are working to make it possible for user to write a plugin in any programming language they wish to.
- Distributed Store (DStore): We are also re-writing the distributed store implementation in OCaml to improve performance, security and safety compared to the current version written in python.
- Dynamic Resource Management: fog05 currently uses a first-fit algorithm to place deployable entities on available resources. We plan to work on optimisation algorithms to improve the placement strategy and potentially dynamically adapt it.

Source Code
Initial Contribution: fog05 is already a usable fog infrastructure. Its code base is avilable at https://github.com/atolab/fog05
fog05 has also dependencies on other Open Source projects that we run. Some of these projects are not yet part for eclipse and we plan to contribute them as fog05 sub-projects, other may naturally become part of Eclipse Cyclone. These are:
- Eclipse Cyclone
- Eclipse Cyclone Python API http://github.com/atolab/python-cdds/
