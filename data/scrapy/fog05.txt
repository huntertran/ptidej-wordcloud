Early IoT applications, especially those addressing the consumer market, have been embracing cloud-centric architectures in which data is pushed up to the cloud. It is within the cloud the everything takes place before eventually pushing some data or action back to the edge. This architectural approach leverages the availability and operational maturity of the cloud but it is not generally applicable in IoT / Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).
Figure1– Cloud centric architecture.
The cloud-centric paradigm quickly shows its limitations in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and in general with Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). More specifically, the following assumptions, at the foundation of cloud-centric architectures, are generally violated in IIoT applications:
Connectivity.
Cloud-centric architectures assume that things are sufficiently often connected. While this is mostly true for IoT applications, it is far from being the common case in IIoT applications. As an example, autonomous agricultural vehicles, or robots in a smart farm are often deployed in locations with very poor connectivity.
Latency.
Cloud-centric architectures assume applications can tolerate the latency associated with pushing data from things to the cloud, processing information on the cloud and eventually sending back some control information. This latency, is orders of magnitude higher of the reaction times required by several IIoT applications, such as, autonomous vehicles, smart factories and smart grids.
Throughput.
Cloud-centric architectures assume that the throughput required to push data from things to the cloud may be massive when looking at the aggregate traffic, but it is generally composed by limited individual flows. In IIoT the situation is quite different as, often, there are data flows with high individual throughput and in several applications the aggregate volume is incredibly high. This makes it unfeasible or not very effective to stream these massive volumes of data to a data centre.
Cost of Connectivity
. Consumer IoT (CIoT) commonly assumes that the cost of connectivity is negligible. This stems from the fact that consumer pays for connectivity – either via their mobile data plan or their home internet connection. In IIoT the situation is completely different, it is the owner of the system that pays for connectivity. This cost is non-negligible in applications with large number of data streams, such as Smart Grids as well as for applications deployed in remote areas such as oil exploitation rigs that can only rely on expensive satellite communication where 1MByte of data can cost as much as $8!
Security.
Cloud-centric architectures operate under the assumption that end-users are comfortable in giving away their data. While this may be true for CIoT applications, the situation is completely different in IIoT. Information is a strategic asset which the vast majority of companies, operating in an industrial, do not want to leave their premises.
Fog computing has emerged as an architectural approach to deal with the limitations exposed by cloud-centric architectures in the context of CPS and IIoT applications.
fog05
is an infrastructure designed from first principle to address the needs of fog computing.
Eclipse fog05

Figure2–
fog05
end-to-end resource virtualisation.
fog05
makes available a set of abstractions to unify the compute, storage and communication fabric end-to-end, thus allowing applications to be managed, monitored and orchestrated across the cloud to thing continuum.
In other terms,
fog05
provides the same
abstraction
of an elastic compute, storage and communication fabric but in a decentralised fashion. The main advantages of this architectural approach, when compared with cloud computing, is the ability to keep the data and the processing close to where it makes the most sense, which in many cases is close to where the data is produced.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the "
5
" in
fog05
beside representing the letter "S" in hackers jargon, it refers to 5G and specifically to Multi-access Edge Computing.
fog05
addresses the needs of MEC and is compatible with ETSI MEC manifests.

Review Information
Eclipse fog05 allows the end-to-end management of compute, storage, networking and I/O fabric in the Edge and Fog Environment. Instead of relying on a centralized architecture (like cloud-management-systems) it is based on a decentralized architecture.
Eclipse fog05 allows users to manage and deploy different types of applications, packaged as containers, VMs, binaries and so on. This possibility is achieved thanks to Eclipse fog05 plugin architecture.
Support for:
- LXD containers
- KVM virtual machines
- native applications
- docker containers (experimental)
API and SDK available in:
- OCaml
- Python 3
- Go

An Eclipse fog05
node
represents a locus of resources. Examples of fog05 nodes are: server, an RPi, an embedded board.
In order to expose its resources in the system each node has either a running fog05 agent or a device plugin.
Network
In Eclipse fog05 a
network
represent a level-2 or level-3 network between a collection of deployable components.
Such networks are usually virtualized, and span across different nodes, even end-to-end, they can also be attached to physical networks.
Router
An Eclipse fog05

is a networking element able to interconnect two or more networks.
It can also connect a network to the physical networking infrastructure.

Location transparent state access and distribution
Edit on GitHub
Eclipse fog05 uses Zenoh to provide location-transparent access to the system state and to distribute this state.
Distributed state
Eclipse fog05 is designed from the beginning to not rely in any
centralized
construct, such as DB servers, controllers and so on.
We made this choice because the problem Eclipse fog05 is trying to address it the management on the Fog infrastructure which by definition is distributed, heterogenous, mobile and with intermittent connectivity. This environment has driven all the design choices in Eclipse fog05, and so in very short time we found ourself with the problem to how access the system state in such environment.

We can now clone the Eclipse fog05 agent repository and build and install the agent
The installation creates the folder
/etc/fos
in which we can found the configuration file
agent.json
and the

itself. It creates as well the systemd files for starting and stopping the service
fos_agent
After installing the agent is required to install at least the OS, Network Manager and one FDU plugin.
Linux Plugin
To install the OS plugin, we need Python3 and a set of dependencies
Then we can clone and install the Linux Plugin

node
may have intermittent connectivity, can move from one place to another in the system, we needed a way to provide
location-transparent
access to the state of each
node
as well as build the system state starting from the state of each single
node
.
We moved towards build all the piece of software in a state-less fashion and leveraging the
location-transparency
state access for storing and retrieving state information.
All the state information in Eclipse fog05 are stored in
Zenoh
a distributed Key-value store, that support location-transparency access, scalability, URI as Keys, it provides a
eventual consistency
model and mechanisms to trigger computations (and so build an RPC on top).
How Eclipse fog05 uses Zenoh
New features:
- Docker container management
- ROS2 Applicaiton management
- Isolation of binaries and ROS2 applications that runs on the same host
- New APIs for more fine-grained life management of the FDUs.

In Eclipse fog05 all the components are designed to be state-less, and to store all the information in Zenoh. Information are organized following a tree structure in order to facilitate queries in Zenoh.
State separation
The whole system state is organized in two different portions.
Public State
Private State
Each of them is then distinct in two different sub-portions.
Actual State
Desired State
As you can image from the name
Public
and
Private
stores respectively information that can be accessed globally and locally, while
Actual
and
Desired
stores respectively actual state information and set-point for the system.
Each of those portion have different read and write permissions, described in the following image.

Eclipse fog05
aims at providing a fog computing platform that provides the equivalent of cloud IaaS along with some foundational PaaS services.
In other terms, the main focus of
fog05
is in providing a scalable infrastructure to:
Virtualise compute, storage and communication end-to-end -- from cloud to thing.
Provide a unified abstraction to provision, manage and monitor
applications
that may be deployed in the cloud to things continuum.
Provide data virtualisation, as this is a foundational service upon which fog-based analytics, monitoring, etc. will be built.
Whilst monitoring and management is in the scope of
fog05
, and dynamic resource management is one of the main area in which we plan to contribute, tools for visualisation are out of scope. Third party tools or other projects will leverage

delete
that applies to different kind of resouces:
fim

The help can be issued by
fosctl -h
and it provides information for each command and each resource.
Let's add a new FIM to our orchestation engine.

We need to pass the UUIDv4 of the FIM we want to add (it is used to identify the FIM by the orchestartor) and the locator to access the Zenoh of that FIM

Deployment
All the component of Eclipse fog05 are designed to be deployed in a distributed manner, in order to address the system heterogeneity. In particular the minimal set to run a fog05
node
is to have an
agent
and a set of
plugins
running on it, while in the case of micro-controllers the minimal set is composed by only the

node
or on different machines.

What is Eclipse fog05?
Edit on GitHub
Eclipse fog05 allows the end-to-end management of compute, storage, networking and I/O fabric in the Edge and Fog Environment. Instead of relying on a centralized architecture (like cloud-management-systems) it is based on a decentralized architecture.
Eclipse fog05 allows users to manage and deploy different types of applications, packaged as containers, VMs, binaries and so on. This possibility is achieved thanks to Eclipse fog05 plugin architecture.
More specifically, Eclipse fog05 is a Fog Infrastructure-as-a-Service solution composed by two major components:
The Fog Orchestration Engine (FOrcE)
The Fog Infrastructure Manager (FIM)
These components provides the abstractions to deploy your applications in the Fog and Edge environment.
Private
The usage of this structure is implemented in the
YaksConnector
object implemented in the SDK for different languages.

Eclipse Incubation
All new projects start in the incubation phase (a project in the incubation phase is said to be incubating). The classification of a project in the incubation phase is not a statement about the quality of the project’s code; rather, the incubation phase is more about the project team’s progress in practicing the open and public processes necessary to establish the three communities (developers, adopters, and users) around the project.
Eclipse Foundation
The Eclipse Foundation provides our global community of individuals and organizations with a mature, scalable, and business-friendly environment for open source software collaboration and innovation. The Foundation is home to the Eclipse IDE, Jakarta EE, and over 350 open source projects, including runtimes, tools, and frameworks for a wide range of technology domains such as the Internet of Things, automotive,geospatial, systems engineering, and many others.

Eclipse fog05 is compatible with ETSI OSM, and can be used as a VIM by this one. Current interoperability is limited to simple NS using LXD containers as VNFs.
Let's suppose we have a multi node fog05 deployment and we want to connect this deployment to OSM to instantiate VNFs.
First let's add the VIM account to OSM
Following paramater can be added
arch
cpu architecture used when creating the VDUs for this VIM account eg. x86_64, aarch64, default is x86_64.
hypervisor
hypervisor supported by this VIM account, can be one of: LXD, KVM, BARE, DOCKER, ROS2, at least one node of the system as to be able to manage the selected hypervisor, currently only LXD is supported within the OSM connector.
Images need to be already present at the VIM.
Example NS
Here you can find and example of network service that can be instantiated to the Eclipse fog05 VIM using OSM. The network service is composed by a single VNF based on an Alpine Linux LXD image.
alpine-vnfd.yaml
alpine-nsd.yaml
VLAN Configuration (optional)

A
Close Loop Orchestration Engine
that monitors, schedules and provide a replica-based self-healing mechanism to the deployed applications.
A set of
connectors
to communicate with different FIM deployments and Kubernetes clusters.
Users interact with
FOrcE
by the means of fosctl a command line utility that uses FOrcE's REST interface for interaction.

that should be the case, but the OSM connector was updated before the release of 0.2.1

In this state the FDU is registered in the catalog but there are no instances in the system
DEFINED
In this state a FDU instance was created in a node, but it is only created, meaning that an instance UUID was assigned to it.
CONFIGURE
The FDU instance was configured in a node, the image was fetched, resources allocated, and the instance was defined in the underlying hypervisor/container engine. Or in case of native application the namespace was created.
RUNNING
The FDU instance is started, the instance is started in the underlying hypervisor/container engine or the native application process is started. Monitoring of the instance begin at this stage.

Just forgot to mention you have to change the address in the script that creates the VIM
tested with 0.2.1 and indeed it seems that there is a timer, btw with 0.2.1 you can just use OSM to check if the service is up, it takes around 1min to update the information from the VIM
The output should be

The FDU instance is instructed for migration, this leads to two different states on the source and destination node. Source node instance transits to TAKE_OFF, when it is ready for migration, while destination instance transits to LANDING when ready for migration. After migration the instance in the source node is destroyed, while in destination node the instance is in RUNNING state. Migration is supported only for collaborative FDUs.
PAUSE
The execution of the instance is freezed. This state is supported only for certain FDUs.
SCALING
The instance is scaled up or down. This state is supported only for certain FDUs.

GitHub - eclipse-fog05/examples: example descriptors and api usage
Mehdi
@meeeehdiiii_twitter
Hi all, if I want to deploy an nginx web server from Dockerhub on fog05, what would be the steps ? :)
so that I can use the webserver at the end.
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Hi
@meeeehdiiii_twitter
, if you already followed the “Hello World” example you can have your FDU descriptor based on the one of the example, just need to point to the right image from dockerhub, this means updating the
uri
in the
image
section of the descriptor to your image on dockerhub eg. in the case of the simple alpine:nginx image it would become like this
Then to use it you need to attach that fdu to a virtual network managed by fog05.
Like you can see in this demo:

Thanks, I tried both (nginx, and ros2-demo) but it was not successfull yet.
when I try to run the ros2-demo, I get "No Nodes in the system".
or I get "Error 404 with message No node found for this FDU" when I use the Linux zenoh.service daemon instead of the eclipse/zenoh docker image. The error comes from this line:
inst_info = a.fdu.define(fdu_id)
And I start the script with
python3 deploy.py localhost:7447
I have the following components running on my LinuxMint:
fos_agent , fos_ctd, fos_linux, fos_linuxbridge, containerd, zenoh

Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
fog05
to address these short comings.
fog05
has been designed from first principle to address the requirements characteristic of fog and multi-access edge computing (MEC).
fog05
provides a decentralised infrastructure that unifies computing, networking and storage fabrics end-to-end, while addressing the challenges imposed by resource heterogeneity.
Finally, it is worth point out that
fog05
has leveraged of the experience we have gained through our experience with fog computing which dates back to its inception. As an example, we were part of the team that in 2015 demonstrated the first fog computing platform operting smart cities services in Barcelona.
Scope:
Eclipse fog05
aims at providing a fog computing platform that provides the equivalent of cloud IaaS along with some foundational PaaS services.

Do I have all required components to run the ros2-demo or do I need additional components/ nodes ?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
For the ROS2 demo you need to install ROS2 and the ROS2 plugin. But as you plan to just unse nginx you do not need to run all the ROS2 demo, it is just a good starting point to see how to describe a virtual network and the FDUs attached to that.
The error you get seems related at the failing of some check during the instantiation process.
Can you check the output of
journalctl -u fos_agent | grep eval_check_fdu
when you get the error?

I wanted to install the CLI but cannot find the install scripts...
Can the CLI already be used to deploy microservices?

In other terms, the main focus of
fog05
is in providing a scalable infrastructure to:
Virtualise compute, storage and communication end-to-end -- from cloud to thing.
Provide a unified abstraction to provision, manage and monitor
applications
that may be deployed in the cloud to things continuum.
Provide data virtualisation, as this is a foundational service upon which fog-based analytics, monitoring, etc. will be built.
Whilst monitoring and management is in the scope of
fog05
, and dynamic resource management is one of the main area in which we plan to contribute, tools for visualisation are out of scope. Third party tools or other projects will leverage
fog05
API to provide
Description:
Early IoT applications, especially those addressing the consumer market, have been embracing cloud-centric architectures in which data is pushed up to the cloud. It is within the cloud the everything takes place before eventually pushing some data or action back to the edge. This architectural approach leverages the availability and operational maturity of the cloud but it is not generally applicable in IoT / Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).
Figure1– Cloud centric architecture.
The cloud-centric paradigm quickly shows its limitations in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and in general with Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). More specifically, the following assumptions, at the foundation of cloud-centric architectures, are generally violated in IIoT applications:

The CLI is not valid anymore, the only way to interact is using the APIs that are available in Go, Python3 and OCaml
We are working in the rewrite of the code base and thus tools like the CLI will be developed while rewriting

Hi again, do you guys have a web server as an example application which can run on top of fog05 ? I didn't manage to do it with Docker and nginx...
( Is it possible with any other virtualization technoloy which is tested already? )

Connectivity.
Cloud-centric architectures assume that things are sufficiently often connected. While this is mostly true for IoT applications, it is far from being the common case in IIoT applications. As an example, autonomous agricultural vehicles, or robots in a smart farm are often deployed in locations with very poor connectivity.
Latency.
Cloud-centric architectures assume applications can tolerate the latency associated with pushing data from things to the cloud, processing information on the cloud and eventually sending back some control information. This latency, is orders of magnitude higher of the reaction times required by several IIoT applications, such as, autonomous vehicles, smart factories and smart grids.
Throughput.
Cloud-centric architectures assume that the throughput required to push data from things to the cloud may be massive when looking at the aggregate traffic, but it is generally composed by limited individual flows. In IIoT the situation is quite different as, often, there are data flows with high individual throughput and in several applications the aggregate volume is incredibly high. This makes it unfeasible or not very effective to stream these massive volumes of data to a data centre.
Cost of Connectivity
. Consumer IoT (CIoT) commonly assumes that the cost of connectivity is negligible. This stems from the fact that consumer pays for connectivity – either via their mobile data plan or their home internet connection. In IIoT the situation is completely different, it is the owner of the system that pays for connectivity. This cost is non-negligible in applications with large number of data streams, such as Smart Grids as well as for applications deployed in remote areas such as oil exploitation rigs that can only rely on expensive satellite communication where 1MByte of data can cost as much as $8!
Security.
Cloud-centric architectures operate under the assumption that end-users are comfortable in giving away their data. While this may be true for CIoT applications, the situation is completely different in IIoT. Information is a strategic asset which the vast majority of companies, operating in an industrial, do not want to leave their premises.
Fog computing has emerged as an architectural approach to deal with the limitations exposed by cloud-centric architectures in the context of CPS and IIoT applications.
fog05
is an infrastructure designed from first principle to address the needs of fog computing.

You can use an LXD container with nginx and everything should be fine
Mehdi
@meeeehdiiii_twitter
@gabrik
I am pretty new to lxd. Does it mean it would have to pull, and run an lxd, then install nginx inside it. And then create a tarball. and this tarball can then be used in the deployment file for fog05 ?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Yes exactly
Mehdi
@meeeehdiiii_twitter
@gabrik
okey thank you! I will try that later. I like the plugin mechanisms of fog05 a lot and that different virtualization technologies can run on fog05 just with a plugin and if the node supports that technology. I have some other questions regarding fog05 principles:
Currently, there is the LinuxBridge network plugin. Is the communication of distributed applications on different nodes in different physical networks a relevant and important topic for fog05 ? The LinuxBridges on both edge nodes have to find themselves over e.g. VPN in order to support distributed communication, right? Another approach would be to let them communicate over a centralized controlplane. But there will be no contralized controlplane. And fog05 mentions just layer2-networking, but no overlay networking. Is distributed communication out of scope of fog05 ?

Project:
Eclipse fog05
Proposal:
Eclipse fog05
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
fog05
to address these short comings.
fog05
has been designed from first principle to address the requirements characteristic of fog and multi-access edge computing (MEC).
fog05
provides a decentralised infrastructure that unifies computing, networking and storage fabrics end-to-end, while addressing the challenges imposed by resource heterogeneity.
Finally, it is worth point out that
fog05
has leveraged of the experience we have gained through our experience with fog computing which dates back to its inception. As an example, we were part of the team that in 2015 demonstrated the first fog computing platform operting smart cities services in Barcelona.

fog05
end-to-end resource virtualisation.
fog05
makes available a set of abstractions to unify the compute, storage and communication fabric end-to-end, thus allowing applications to be managed, monitored and orchestrated across the cloud to thing continuum.
In other terms,
fog05
provides the same
abstraction
of an elastic compute, storage and communication fabric but in a decentralised fashion. The main advantages of this architectural approach, when compared with cloud computing, is the ability to keep the data and the processing close to where it makes the most sense, which in many cases is close to where the data is produced.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the "
5
" in
fog05
beside representing the letter "S" in hackers jargon, it refers to 5G and specifically to Multi-access Edge Computing.
fog05
addresses the needs of MEC and is compatible with ETSI MEC manifests.
Why Here?:
ADLINK has taken the corporate decision of supporting Eclipse and creating an ecosystem of technologies for edge/fog computing in the context of Eclipse IoT. Eclipse Cyclone was the first step in that direction,

except the plugin-net-linuxbridge, are there any other networks plugins that fog05 plans to support later?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Hi
@meeeehdiiii_twitter
, yes the communication, I will rather say, networking between distributed applications is in the scope of fog05. The LinuxBridge plugin indeed creates L2 overlay networks between different FDUs (an FDU is anything that fog05 can manage eg. VMs, Containers, binaries), current implementation is using VxLAN with multicast discovery of the end-points, so it works well inside a LAN. There is plan to add to the LinuxBridge plugin also the possibility to create L3 overlay networks (using GRE) and Point-to-Point VxLAN (thus allowing FDUs in differents LANs to communicate). We tend to preferr decentralized solutions but for in case of nodes in different LANs what we see is that the use of a common rendez vous point is needed, (point-to-point VxLAN or GRE) and then inside LANs the communication can still leverage on VxLAN with multicast end-point discovery.
We are also investigating the possibility to provide a out-of-the-box virtual network to be used by default by fog05 FDUs, something like the docker0 bridge from Docker, to facilitate users in their first approach.
As already stated before, we are currently working on a rewrite and redesign of some internal components in rust (
https://www.rust-lang.org/
) and this involves offcourse the networking plugins and their interface.
I hope this answers your questions, in any case please feel free to ask.

Thanks for the hints. I am currently writing my master thesis about cloud/edge computing topics; and fog05 has interesting topics.

Eclipse fog05
aims at providing a fog computing platform that provides the equivalent of cloud IaaS along with some foundational PaaS services.
In other terms, the main focus of
fog05
is in providing a scalable infrastructure to:
Virtualise compute, storage and communication end-to-end -- from cloud to thing.
Provide a unified abstraction to provision, manage and monitor
applications
that may be deployed in the cloud to things continuum.
Provide data virtualisation, as this is a foundational service upon which fog-based analytics, monitoring, etc. will be built.
Whilst monitoring and management is in the scope of
fog05
, and dynamic resource management is one of the main area in which we plan to contribute, tools for visualisation are out of scope. Third party tools or other projects will leverage
fog05
API to provide

fog05
is the logical consequence.
When evaluating the different open source foundations, we selected Eclipse and specifically Eclipse IoT because of its focus on IoT, its transparent community approach and its extremely active marketing.
Licenses:
Eclipse Public License 2.0
Legal Issues:
To the best of our knowledge fog05 name or trademark is not owned by any party.
We own the domain fog05.io and agree to transfer it to Eclipse by submiting the proper
transfer agreement
.
Project Scheduling:
As we are already running and Open Source project we are ready to do the initial contribution immediately.
Future Work:
Our main areas of focus are the following:
-
fog05 Agent:
We are rewriting the core of the agent in OCaml in order to improve performance, security and to allow for deployments on the MirageOS (http://mirage.io) unikernel. This kind of deployment (depicted below), will allow us to have an extremely small surface of attack. For those of you that are not aware of the MirageOS they have had a bit-coin challenge for a few years and nobody has managed to hack into this unikernel yet.

Early IoT applications, especially those addressing the consumer market, have been embracing cloud-centric architectures in which data is pushed up to the cloud. It is within the cloud the everything takes place before eventually pushing some data or action back to the edge. This architectural approach leverages the availability and operational maturity of the cloud but it is not generally applicable in IoT / Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).
Figure1– Cloud centric architecture.
The cloud-centric paradigm quickly shows its limitations in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and in general with Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). More specifically, the following assumptions, at the foundation of cloud-centric architectures, are generally violated in IIoT applications:
Connectivity.
Cloud-centric architectures assume that things are sufficiently often connected. While this is mostly true for IoT applications, it is far from being the common case in IIoT applications. As an example, autonomous agricultural vehicles, or robots in a smart farm are often deployed in locations with very poor connectivity.
Latency.
Cloud-centric architectures assume applications can tolerate the latency associated with pushing data from things to the cloud, processing information on the cloud and eventually sending back some control information. This latency, is orders of magnitude higher of the reaction times required by several IIoT applications, such as, autonomous vehicles, smart factories and smart grids.
Throughput.
Cloud-centric architectures assume that the throughput required to push data from things to the cloud may be massive when looking at the aggregate traffic, but it is generally composed by limited individual flows. In IIoT the situation is quite different as, often, there are data flows with high individual throughput and in several applications the aggregate volume is incredibly high. This makes it unfeasible or not very effective to stream these massive volumes of data to a data centre.
Cost of Connectivity
. Consumer IoT (CIoT) commonly assumes that the cost of connectivity is negligible. This stems from the fact that consumer pays for connectivity – either via their mobile data plan or their home internet connection. In IIoT the situation is completely different, it is the owner of the system that pays for connectivity. This cost is non-negligible in applications with large number of data streams, such as Smart Grids as well as for applications deployed in remote areas such as oil exploitation rigs that can only rely on expensive satellite communication where 1MByte of data can cost as much as $8!
Security.
Cloud-centric architectures operate under the assumption that end-users are comfortable in giving away their data. While this may be true for CIoT applications, the situation is completely different in IIoT. Information is a strategic asset which the vast majority of companies, operating in an industrial, do not want to leave their premises.
Fog computing has emerged as an architectural approach to deal with the limitations exposed by cloud-centric architectures in the context of CPS and IIoT applications.

Plugin API:
Currently
fog05
plugins are written in python. We are working to make it possible for user to write a plugin in any programming language they wish to.
-
Distributed Store (DStore):
We are also re-writing the distributed store implementation in OCaml to improve performance, security and safety compared to the current version written in python.
-
Dynamic Resource Management:
fog05 currently uses a first-fit algorithm to place deployable entities on available resources. We plan to work on optimisation algorithms to improve the placement strategy and potentially dynamically adapt it.

Eclipse fog05
Hi
@gabrik
I think there is some problem during the installation of the native plugin: running a native application doesn't work and I get this error message in the log "sudo: fos_containerize: command not found". I checked the binary in /usr/bin and its size is 0. Replacing it with the correct file as written in the Makefile (sudo ln -sf /etc/fos/plugins/plugin-fdu-native/utils/containerize /usr/bin/fos_containerize) makes the native plugin work again.
Also, I cannot seem to get a connection to the internet from within a native application run through fog05 but I remember that a few months I was able to: has something changed?
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Hi
@marcogozzi
thanks for reporting this, I guess there is an error in the makefile/debian file.
Regarding connectivity issue, by default the native plugin isolates the binaries in a separate namespace, so network is isolated if not connected to a virtual network that then is able to reach the internet or bridged to an existing virtual bridge.
You can disable isolation, it is a configuration flag in
/etc/fos/plugins/plugin-fdu-native/native_plugin.json
just changing isolation to false

end-to-end resource virtualisation.
fog05
makes available a set of abstractions to unify the compute, storage and communication fabric end-to-end, thus allowing applications to be managed, monitored and orchestrated across the cloud to thing continuum.
In other terms,
fog05
provides the same
abstraction
of an elastic compute, storage and communication fabric but in a decentralised fashion. The main advantages of this architectural approach, when compared with cloud computing, is the ability to keep the data and the processing close to where it makes the most sense, which in many cases is close to where the data is produced.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the "

Introduction
Location transparent state access and distribution
Hello World!
Edit on GitHub
To kick off our tour of Eclipse fog05 and to demonstrate use and access of the Fog Infrastructure Manager, we will start with the obligatory “hello world” example. This example will deploy a docker container that just prints “Hello World!”
Let's get started.
First, we need to install
containerd
m the containerd plugin for Eclipse fog05 and the fog05 client API.
Once it is installed let's start the fog05 services
Next we need to write the descriptor for this container. Let's call it
fdu_helloworld.json
:
Let's imagine that our descriptor was saved in our
$HOME
directory, we can use this simple python script to deploy the “hello world” example
We can save this file as

The End-to-End Compute, Storage and Networking Virtualisation solution.
Eclipse fog05 is an open source project that aims at providing a decentralised infrastructure for provisioning and managing compute, storage, communication and I/O resources available anywhere across the network. Eclipse fog05 addresses highly heterogeneous systems even those with extremely resource-constrained nodes.
Get started
Unified abstractions
Common API and information model for management. Eclipse fog05 provides an unified API for the management of the virtualisation infrastructure.
Operating System Plugins
Eclipse fog05 can run on different operating systems, it just need the right OS Plugin.
Networking Plugins
Eclipse fog05 can manage networking fabrics for which a Netwoking plugin is present.
Learn more
Heterogenous applications
Support of heterogenous runtimes, hypervisors and networking. Deploy heterogenous applications composed by VMs, containers, ROS2, native applications.
Runtime Plugins
Eclipse fog05 can manage and open-ended set of hypervisors and container technologies for which a Runtime Plugin was implemented.
Single Descriptor
Eclipse fog05 allows you to define your application in a single descriptor. No matters if it is composed by heterogeneous components.

@marcogozzi
Thanks, I didn't notice that flag.
By the way, I think there is a similar issue with the linux net plugin as the file /urs/bin/fos_get_address also has size 0 and it is created by another Makefile. I hope it can help you fix the problem.
Gabriele Baldoni
@gabrik
Indeed both should be links to the binaries inside the plugin directory, with a quick check the fos_containerize link is broken, while the other one seems fine. Will fix this ASAP

the issue is solved for both native and linuxbridge plugin, you can find the latest releases here:

fog05
beside representing the letter "S" in hackers jargon, it refers to 5G and specifically to Multi-access Edge Computing.
fog05
addresses the needs of MEC and is compatible with ETSI MEC manifests.
Why Here?:
ADLINK has taken the corporate decision of supporting Eclipse and creating an ecosystem of technologies for edge/fog computing in the context of Eclipse IoT. Eclipse Cyclone was the first step in that direction,
fog05
is the logical consequence.
When evaluating the different open source foundations, we selected Eclipse and specifically Eclipse IoT because of its focus on IoT, its transparent community approach and its extremely active marketing.
Initial Contribution:
fog05
is already a usable fog infrastructure. Its code base is avilable at
https://github.com/atolab/fog05
fog05
has also dependencies on other Open Source projects that we run. Some of these projects are not yet part for eclipse and we plan to contribute them as fog05 sub-projects, other may naturally become part of Eclipse Cyclone. These are:
- Eclipse Cyclone
- Eclipse Cyclone Python API

Our main areas of focus are the following:
-
fog05 Agent:
We are rewriting the core of the agent in OCaml in order to improve performance, security and to allow for deployments on the MirageOS (http://mirage.io) unikernel. This kind of deployment (depicted below), will allow us to have an extremely small surface of attack. For those of you that are not aware of the MirageOS they have had a bit-coin challenge for a few years and nobody has managed to hack into this unikernel yet.
-
Plugin API:
Currently
fog05
plugins are written in python. We are working to make it possible for user to write a plugin in any programming language they wish to.
-
Distributed Store (DStore):
We are also re-writing the distributed store implementation in OCaml to improve performance, security and safety compared to the current version written in python.
-
Dynamic Resource Management:
fog05 currently uses a first-fit algorithm to place deployable entities on available resources. We plan to work on optimisation algorithms to improve the placement strategy and potentially dynamically adapt it.
