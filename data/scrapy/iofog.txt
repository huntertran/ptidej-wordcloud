Added documentation to support new Environment variables for Docker Containers

Ported all CI to Azure Pipelines
Simplified Packaging, Tagging and Release process for public artifacts
Implemented initial cross component integration tests suite in Test Runner repo

Integrated Snyk for continual security and vulnerability analysis
Cleaned up, refactored and retired old/crufty repos, branches and code we no longer needed
API Certification: The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".Architectural Issues: We paid down a ton of legacy tech debt in this release, removing a slew of old repos, and defunct branches from the repos we wanted to keep. Additionally, we aligned all compoents to build from a new set of baseline docker images. Additionally, we reimplemented CI on top of Azure pipelines to give us true CI, not just periodic builds (which had been the case on Travis).
For this release we have submitted all outstanding CQs and removed libs that were questionable from a license stand point.
Lastly, a new Test Runner repo contains a full stack integration test suite (or at least the initial version of it) that will test a fully deployed system post CI snapshot builds.
Security Issues: We have integrated Snyk as a tool into our build pipeline to immediately alert on security issues.
Non-Code Aspects: New release artifacts are available on PackageCloud. Single one line install for most components. We have upgrade documentation at iofog.org and simplified the Demo and tutorial flow and experience for a completely new ioFog user.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verifiedCommunities: We have added new committers to the project, and actively supported all users on the ioFog Discuss forums.

Release Plan
Review Information
1.3.0 brings new quality of life improvements as well as a set of backend changes that extend and unify ioFog's capabilities.
ioFog Kubernetes support has been improved by expanding the ioFog Kubernetes Operator's capabilities. Now orchestration of ioFog Kubernetes is handled by the Operator. Previously, Helm and iofogctl were handling this orchestration themselves, in disparate ways.
ioFog Controller has been updated to allow for external databases to be used instead of the embedded SQLite default database. Helm and iofogctl have been updated to allow users to integrate their external databases during the deployment process.
The unified CLI, iofogctl, has been improved to allow users more granular control over resources like Connectors and Microservices. Users can now view realtime deployment status of Microservices through iofogctl due to improvements to both ioFog Controller and Agent.
The iofog-go-sdk has been updated to provide an HTTP client for ioFog Controller's REST API.

Release Plan
Review Information
Majore ioFog release 2.0.0 brings new ioFog Edge Compute Network (ECN) model, with legacy Connector being replaced by much more robust Router based on Apache Qpid, with Kubernetes integration enabled by Red Hat's project Skupper.
The major release also stabilizes Controller to Agent API specification, so that custom implementations of Agents are now possible, such as Agents in Golang or on Android.
Many other smaller features have been added to the ioFog Engine, such as better Docker image pruning, registry management and more robust centralised logging support.

API Certification: The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".Architectural Issues: We have made major improvements in the architecture of Controller, simplifying deployment and unifying a new visualizer into the distro. Additionally, ioFog agent install now seamlessly supports making the necessary changes to ARM Docker envionrments to remove a bunch of headache for end users.
The addition of iofogctl as a unified CLI drove us to expose further management and monitoring APIs via REST, so the entire platform is now configurabler and manageable via REST.
Security Issues: Inceased identity verification between ioFog Connector and ioFog Controller to allow for widely distributed deployments to operate more securely.
Non-Code Aspects: We have added further documentation tutorials that include
ioFog platform deployment to kubernetes
Installing ioFog via HELM to Kubernetes
iofogctl command line tool and management/deployment of ioFog
Updated all of the demo/tutorial documentation
Improved the API documentation
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verified

Code snippets:
ioFogClient implements all methods to communicate with ioFog (via local API).
IOMessage represent all message communication between ioFog and Containers.
IOMessageUtils class is convenient to encode and decode byte arrays.
ioFogAPIListener - listener's interface for requests to ioFog.
set up custom host, port and container's ID (in case of no params default values for host and port will be used: 'ioFog', 54321):
ioFogClient ioFogClient = new ioFogClient("iofog", 54321, "TEST_CONTAINER_ID");
REST calls
post new ioMessage to ioFog via REST call (could trigger onError, onBadRequest and onMessageReceipt listener's methods):
IOMessage message = new IOMessage();
MyIOFAPIListener ioFogListener = new MyIOFAPIListener(); // implementation of listener's interface
ioFogClient ioFogClient = new ioFogClient("iofog", 54321, "TEST_CONTAINER_ID");

Eclipse ioFog 2.0.0

Issues
Release Plan
Review Information(active tab)
Description: Majore ioFog release 2.0.0 brings new ioFog Edge Compute Network (ECN) model, with legacy Connector being replaced by much more robust Router based on Apache Qpid, with Kubernetes integration enabled by Red Hat's project Skupper.
The major release also stabilizes Controller to Agent API specification, so that custom implementations of Agents are now possible, such as Agents in Golang or on Android.
Many other smaller features have been added to the ioFog Engine, such as better Docker image pruning, registry management and more robust centralised logging support.

Eclipse ioFog 1.3.0
Primary tabsOverview
Issues
Release Plan
Review Information(active tab)
Description: 1.3.0 brings new quality of life improvements as well as a set of backend changes that extend and unify ioFog's capabilities.
ioFog Kubernetes support has been improved by expanding the ioFog Kubernetes Operator's capabilities. Now orchestration of ioFog Kubernetes is handled by the Operator. Previously, Helm and iofogctl were handling this orchestration themselves, in disparate ways.
ioFog Controller has been updated to allow for external databases to be used instead of the embedded SQLite default database. Helm and iofogctl have been updated to allow users to integrate their external databases during the deployment process.
The unified CLI, iofogctl, has been improved to allow users more granular control over resources like Connectors and Microservices. Users can now view realtime deployment status of Microservices through iofogctl due to improvements to both ioFog Controller and Agent.
The iofog-go-sdk has been updated to provide an HTTP client for ioFog Controller's REST API.

Test Message Generator
As developers build ioElement containers, they start by building the code in a non-container environment. They need to test the code before spending the time turning it into a published container, but they can't actually test the processing of messages or connection to the ioFog instance without going through the publishing and deployment process.
Test Message Generator is a surrogate version of the ioFog Local API. It mimics the API endpoints of the real ioFog Local API, including offering the Control Websocket and Message Websocket. It runs on "localhost" so it can be reached directly on the computer that is being used to build the ioElement container.
A developer can precisely mimic the production environment on their build machine by mapping a host. If they map "127.0.0.1" with the host name "iofog" then their local code will be able to operate with the same "http://iofog:54321/" endpoints found in the SDKs and described in the API specification.
Configuration (under files folder examples) :
The developer can set up a list of fully defined ioMessages that the Test Message Generator will output in messages.xml . The messages will be send randomly.
The messages that are posted into the Test Message Generator will be stored in receivedmessages.xml file.
Configuration JSON for the ioElement container that the Test Message Generator will give as output can be specified in containerconfig.json file.
"new configuration" control message and "new message" data message will be send to the ioElement container at the interval specified by the developer im milliseconds at config.xml:

The ioFog Test Runner provides a convenient way to run multiple smoke test suites on a deployed Edge Compute Network (ECN).
The suite by default does not run any non-smoke tests, i.e. tests that would invalidate or potentially break the ECN, therefore it can be used on staging a productions ECNs to verify correct deployment.
The following test suites are available:
Controller REST API smoke tests
Agent CLI smoke tests
Basic microservice deployment integration tests
Note that some of additional test suites are automatically skipped as of this release of Test Runner.
Prerequisites
You must have iofogctl configured with its default namespace pointing to the ECN you want to test

iofogctl is a CLI for the installation, configuration, and operation of ioFog
Edge Compute Networks (ECNs).
It can be used to remotely manage multiple ECNs from a single host. It is built for ioFog users and DevOps engineers
wanting to manage ECNs. It is modelled on existing tools such as Terraform or kubectl that can be used to automate
infrastructure-as-code.

Homebrew tap for iofogctl
container needs to be run with 2 options to grant access: --net=host --privileged
Upon startup the container will start scanning if bluetooth is powered on and upon discovering devices it will store them locally and generate an internal ID. In most cases the container will work with this locally stored devices unless the scanning is restarted. If container received command to restart scanning it will delete all previously stored devices and start scanning anew ( which results in generating new local IDs for devices).
Container will return 'Timeout exception' in case if it didn't get any results of processing.
device with specified mac was't found while scanning anew
device is inactive and container hang up on trying to connect to it
after connecting to device container hang up on discovering services
Container provides next REST endpoints :
Set Device Identifier (POST)
This endpoint provides the possibility to set config for bluetooth-rest-api system container, upon receiving config container will wipe out all previously stored devices and restart scanning. 'name' - will tell container differentiate devices' uniqueness by localname, 'mac' - will tell container differentiate devices' uniqueness by mac address
Endpoint 1
http://localhost:10500/config/scan
POST JSON raw body
{ "deviceIdentifier" : "name"/"mac" }
Response
"New config applied. Scanning restarted"
iofog/nodejs-sdk
send new message to ioFog (sendNewMessage)
fetch next unread messages from ioFog (getNextMessages)
fetch messages for time period and list of accessible publishers (getMessagesByQuery)
get config options (getConfig)
create ioMessage JSON object (ioMessage)
connect to ioFog Control Channel via WebSocket (wsControlConnection)
connect to ioFog Message Channel via WebSocket (wsMessageConnection) and publish new message via this channel (wsSendMessage)
Code snippets:
import module:
var ioFogClient = require('@iofog/nodejs-sdk');
set up custom host, port and container's ID (in case of no params default values for host and port will be used: 'ioFog', 54321)
and pass main callback to trigger when ioFogClient initialization is done:
ioFogClient.init( 'iofog', 54321, null,
// any code to perform after ioFog is initialized
-e AGENT_KEY="/root/.ssh/id_rsa" \
iofog/test-runner:latest
Note that whenever AGENTS is specified, you need to mount appropriate ssh keys to /root/.ssh of the test-runner containers. The keys can be in any default SSH position: ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
Test Results
The output of this test-suite currently is a single XML File that is Junit-XML compliant.
This can be used in development pipelines on most DevOps infrastructure to display test results
in easy to consume factor.
This is used in Azure Pipelines to display each builds pass/fail for both entire test suites
as well as for specific tests we may see multiple failures in, to help identify issues that may not be consistent.
The test output is file is TEST-RESULTS.xml and is stored in /root/test-results of the test-runner container.

In order to create the cluster role binding on GKE, you need to have roles/container.admin permission. If your account doesn't have the role, it can be added using the following:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=user:person@company.com --role=roles/container.admin
Next, create service account for Tiller and bind cluster-admin role.
kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller-svacc
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-crb --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller-svacc
Initialize Helm And Install Tiller
Now is the time to use our service account to initialize Helm.
helm init --service-account tiller --wait
Note that on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), we will also need to specify node selectors for Tiller.
helm init --service-account tiller --node-selectors "beta.kubernetes.io/os"="linux" --wait
Install ioFog Stack
Add this Helm repository to our Helm repository index and install the ioFog stack and Kubernetes services
helm repo add iofog https://eclipse-iofog.github.io/helm
We can list all available versions of the ioFog Helm chart using helm search -l iofog/iofog. From Helm 2.16 onwards, only charts with production versions are listed by default. To list all versions, including development versions, use helm search -l --devel iofog
To install a specific version of ioFog, use helm install:
helm install \

IoMessage represent all message communication between ioFog and Containers.
IoMessageUtils class is convenient to encode and decode byte arrays.
IIoFogRestApiHandler and IIoFogWebSocketApiHandler - interfaces for handling requests to ioFog via REST and WS APIs respectively.
Set up custom host, port and container's ID (in case of no params default values for host and port will be used: 'iofog', 54321):
var restHandler = new RestHandler(); // implementation of the IIoFogRestApiHandler interface
var restClient = new IoFogRestApiClient(restHandler, "iofog", 54321); // creating instance of REST API ioFog client
var wsHandler = new WsHandler(); // implementation of the IIoFogWebSocketApiHandler interface
var restClient = new IoFogRestApiClient(wsHandler, "iofog", 54321); // creating instance of WS API ioFog client
You can also use custom ContainerId for testing purposes by specifying SELFNAME environment variable.
REST calls (could trigger OnException, OnBadRequest handler's methods):
Post new IoMessage to ioFog via REST call
var message = new IoMessage();
var handler = new RestHandler(); // implementation of the IIoFogRestApiHandler interface
var client = new IoFogRestApiClient(handler); // creating instance of REST API ioFog client
var response = await client.PostMessageAsync(message);
Get list of IoMessages by time frame for accessible publishers from ioFog via REST call
var handler = new RestHandler(); // implementation of the IIoFogRestApiHandler interface

What is Connector?
Is an internetworking aid for ioFog nodes
Provides “double opt-in” connections for secure IoT connectivity
We call this module "Connector" because it acts as a virtual connection between ioFog nodes.
Connector installs on any common version of Linux. It handles the traffic between Fog nodes. You can have as many Connector instances in a Iofog deployment as you want.
When you put Connector, anywhere on your network (it can be even public Internet), anywhere that is visible to fog nodes, the Connector facilitates this talk to each other, it facilitates opening a port on public internet to talk to the fog. Thus you can reach microservices remotely, and microservices come in together from different locations.

Build from Source
This project uses go modules so it must be built from outside of your $GOPATH.
Go 1.13+ is a prerequisite. Install all other dependancies with:
make bootstrap
Make sure that your $PATH contains $GOBIN, otherwise make build will fail on the basis that command rice is not found.
See all make commands by running:
make
To build and install, go ahead and run:
make build install
iofogctl --help
iofogctl is installed in /usr/local/bin
Running Tests
Run project unit tests:
make test
This will output a JUnit compatible file into reports/TEST-iofogctl.xml that can be imported in most CI systems.

1. In order to install Connector, you need to have Java installed on your machine.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
2 Install Connector
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/iofog/iofog-connector/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install iofog-connector
3. Setup certificates if needed (After installation there are configs.json, server-cert.pem and server-key.pem files present in the /etc/iofog-connector directory)
- configs.json contains the list of existing connections
- server-cert.pem is a public key that tells that Iofog-Controller is allowed to Connector
- server-key.pem is a private key that has its own identity and uses it to talk to ioFog agent
4. Add iofog-connector.conf config file to Connector
sudo echo '{
"ports": [
"6000-6001",
"7000-7002",
"30000-39999",

Connection to Installed ioFog
Once the installation is complete, you will be able to connect to the ioFog Controller on K8s using iofogctl.
iofogctl connect k8s-ctrl --kube-config ~/.kube/config --email user@domain.com --pass any123password345
Once you are connected, you can use iofogctl to deploy edge Agents. Then, you can use kubectl or iofogctl to deploy microservices to your edge Agents.
Multiple Edge Compute Networks
If we want to have multiple instances of ioFog on the same Kubernetes cluster, it is necessary to tell Helm not to install custom resource definitions. This can be done by overriding the createCustomResources (default: true) variable.
helm install \
--set createCustomResources=false \
--set controlPlane.user.email=user@domain.com \

To use websocket connections you should implement listeners as follows:
class MyControlListener(IoFogControlWsListener):
def on_control_signal(self):
# do smth on control signal
class MyMessageListener(IoFogMessageWsListener):
def on_receipt(self, message_id, timestamp):
# do smth with message receipt
def on_message(self, io_msg):
# do smth with new message
After that you can establish websocket connections:
client.establish_message_ws_connection(MyMessageListener())
client.establish_control_ws_connection(MyControlListener())
Each of those connections will be managed in a separate thread.
After successful connection to message websocket you can send to it:

iofog/iofog
Only use this option when the ioFog custom resource exists, either from another Helm installation or manual installation using iofogctl.
To check if the custom resources exist, run kubectl get crd | grep iofog. If the resources exist, we must use createCustomResources=false so that Helm does not try to create them again.
Uninstall ioFog Stack
To uninstall ioFog stack, simply delete the Helm release, where the release name refers to --name arguments used during installation.
helm delete --purge my-ecn
Note that due to Helm's handing of custom resource definitions, all such definitions are orphaned when a release is created and thus need to be deleted manually.

Connector API
Connector exposes API and it’s API where you have a set of identities. Fog Controller has the proper identity and it’s able to tell Connector “I want you to open up some connections”. Fog Controller uses Connector API to tell it to do and Connector simply replies whether it is successful or not successful.
ioFog Agent connects to Connectors and through connecting Connectors traffic is able to move between fog nodes. In addition Connector has the capability to open traffic to the outside world so the outside users can get route into fog node.
Connector offers two connectivity types:
1) The first type, called a public pipe, provides a way to securely access Fog software and data from anywhere on in the world. Connector punches through firewalls and NATed networks to perform automatic internetworking of the Fog.
Let’s describe what mapping is. Mapping is a way for describing a port opening, no matter whether you create a public or private pipe. It is an object that has an internal and an external port.
Endpoint: /api/v2/mapping/add
Method: POST
Header Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
"maxconnections" means how many connection threads the ioFog agent will make with the Connector . You can have many users at the same time.
"heartbeatabsencethreshold" means if we don’t have a heartbeat signal from the ioFog agent within 20 sec, we kill that connection thread.

Imagine a world where you can choose self-contained pieces of code (called microservices) and make them run anywhere you want at the push of a button. Where you can remotely control the code that is running on twenty iPhones in workers' pockets, thirty servers running in a factory building, and ten computers running in the trucks that ship your products... and you can do it all with the same single technology. Imagine a world where you move the processing close to where the data is happening, and where you can finally separate streams of information from the end applications that use them. This world will be brought to life by iofog, and a big part of the vision is the ioFog product that runs on the various computers.
This repository is the production code base for the x86 Linux version of the ioFog product.
ioFog is a service that runs constantly in the background on a Linux machine. It is the agent that turns a Linux computer into a piece of the iofog I/O compute fog.
There should be an ioFog code base for every processing platform that becomes part of the I/O compute fog. Network connectivity, process invocation, thread management, and other details of an ioFog will vary from platform to platform. The same ioFog principles apply to every version, but the implementation of the principles should match the native languages and structures best suited for the platform.
Status
Principles of an ioFog Agent:
Never go down
Respond immediately to the fog controller
Operate flawlessly when offline
Report status frequently and reliably
Execute instructions with no understanding of the bigger picture
Provide a high-performance message bus and local API
Enforce the configured resource consumption constraints strictly
Allow the most flexible and powerful processing element model possible
Be able to instantiate processing elements from any available source
Be able to communicate with any reachable fog controller
Allow processing elements to implement security and connectivity as they would natively

Endpoint 16
Response
{
"data": "base64 encoded data"
}
Subscribe to characteristic's notify event (GET)
This endpoint sets notify property to true for specified characteristic's cID for specified service sID and device dID/Mac Address and returns url where buffered values can be picked up. If timeout parameter is specified (in millisecond) it'll be applied, otherwise RESTBlue will use the default value 1 min (60000 milliseconds).
This timeout is specified to handle usecase when device is still connected and advertising, but RESTBlue stopped receiving any data on notify subscription.
When picking up buffered notify data:
If RESTBlue doesn't receive any data for more than specified timeout it will unsubscribe and remove notify buffer url and return 500 status code with error:TIMEOUT_DATA.
In case if device disconnected while being subscribed the response will be OK with device_disconnected:true and last batch of data.

You can test the release Gatsby build using npm run-script build, and to preview the website locally, follow instructions in Local Deployment.
Cut a new major/minor version and publish (maintainers only)
To create a new version of documentation (usually for new major release), we need to first update the npm package version and then create a new version of the documentation.
Note that the staging documentation in content/docs/next will be used to create the new version.
If there are any fixed in the previous documentation, it is advisable to propagate them into the staging documentation first before proceeding.
npm version 1.2.0 --no-git-tag-version
node scripts/copy-docs.js 1.2.0
After this you are ready to checkin the new version.

ioFog Demo
This repository demonstrates the capabilities of ioFog. It spins up the ioFog stack (Agent, Controller, and Connector) on a local machine in a Docker Compose environment. This basic ioFog stack setup constitutes a small, but fully configured Edge Compute Network (ECN).
Optionally, this demo also creates a sample application (microservices deployed on the ioFog stack).
This demo repository is used as supplementary materials for ioFog quickstart and ioFog tutorial guides.
Prerequisites
The ioFog demo requires one of the following systems and tools to be installed. The scripts in this demo do not install any of these tools, but they check for sufficient versions.

Eclipse ioFog Platform
Supported operating systems:
Linux (kernel v3.10+)
macOS 10.12+
Requires tools:
Docker 1.10+ (installation instructions)
iofogctl 1.3.0+ (installation instructions)
Try ioFog - Simple Edge Compute Network
The main interaction with this demo repository is encapsulated into a set of simple scripts: start.sh, test.sh and stop.sh. Interactions with the ioFog components can be done using a command line interface available in all the services of the stack, or using a REST API.
Spin Up The ioFog Stack
Spin up the blank ioFog stack (Agent, Controller, and Connector) on the local machine.
./start.sh
Verify the iofog stack is provisioned correctly. The automated tests run a smoke test suite on the blank ioFog stack, testing basic operations.
./test.sh
You can also verify manually that the ioFog stack containers are correctly started.
docker ps --filter "name=iofog"
When you are finished, tear down the ioFog stack and all services deployed on it.
./stop.sh

Creation Review
Eclipse ioFog Creation Review
Type: CreationState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, September 21, 2016Project: Eclipse ioFogProposal:
ioFog
Parent Project: Eclipse IoTBackground: There are many great ways to build IoT software in the cloud. And there are many great ways to store and analyze the large amounts of data produced by sensors and devices.
Yet there are few ways to build IoT software that runs in a real-world location such as a warehouse or a hospital room. Developing and deploying software to these edge locations can be time consuming, expensive, and inflexible.
ioFog was created to solve these problems. The goal is to make developing IoT edge software feel like developing for the cloud, but with even more power.
Scope: 1. A software agent, ioFog, that provides a universal runtime for IoT micro services
2. A node controller allowing to control ioFog instances
3. SDKs in multiple programming languages, allowing developers to program containerized edge applications and micro-services
4. Development tools to author and simulate various deployment scenarios

This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse IoT
Background: There are many great ways to build IoT software in the cloud. And there are many great ways to store and analyze the large amounts of data produced by sensors and devices.
Yet there are few ways to build IoT software that runs in a real-world location such as a warehouse or a hospital room. Developing and deploying software to these edge locations can be time consuming, expensive, and inflexible.
ioFog was created to solve these problems. The goal is to make developing IoT edge software feel like developing for the cloud, but with even more power.
Scope: 1. A software agent, ioFog, that provides a universal runtime for IoT micro services
2. A node controller allowing to control ioFog instances
3. SDKs in multiple programming languages, allowing developers to program containerized edge applications and micro-services
4. Development tools to author and simulate various deployment scenarios
Description: The Eclipse ioFog set of technologies is a fog computing layer that can be installed on any hardware running Linux. Once installed, it provides a universal runtime for microservices to run on the edge. In addition to a common runtime, ioFog also provides a set of useful services including a message bus, dynamic configuration of the microservices, and remote debugging.
Automated interconnection of ioFog instances is provided by the ComSat component. This relieves developers from writing code just to move data from one place to another.
Orchestration and management of microservices (the edge software) is provided by the ioAuthoring application and the ioFog instances receive their instructions through the fabric controller.
Working together, these components provide a full set of technologies for building and running IoT software the executes wherever the developer chooses.

The Eclipse ioFog Platform project provides means to spin up and deploy minimal infrastructure. Currently, we demonstrate how to achieve this on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), although since we are using
Terraform under the covers you can easily extend/contribute to support your preferred
cloud infrastructure provider.
Required Tools
In order to setup the infrastructure we will need the following tools:
Terraform (version 0.12.*, installation instructions)
GCloud SDK (quickstart guide)
Kubectl (installation instructions)
To then install a complete EdgeCompute Network (ECN), we will also need iofogctl:
iofogctl (installation instructions)
We don't have to install these tools manually now. Later in the process, we will use a script to download those dependencies and initialise terraform variable file.
Provided script ./bootstrap.sh will download those dependencies, see details below.
Required Credentials
GCP Service Account
First, we need to setup gcloud with our project. We can either establish a service account or use a personal account with GCP. In both cases, the minimal set of IAM roles required is:
Build from local images
If you have a local image version of the Agent, Controller and Connector, you can chose to build the containers using those local images.
To do so, you will need a docker image for the Agent, the Connector and the Controller.
You can provide start.sh with an option for each local package you want to use.
Example
Command:
./start.sh -a gcr.io/focal-freedom-236620/agent:latest -cn gcr.io/focal-freedom-236620/connector:latest -ct gcr.io/focal-freedom-236620/controller:latest
ECN Status
./status.sh # Will show you all iofog-related containers currently running.
Interacting With The ioFog Stack - CLI
The simplest way to interact with Agent, Controller, and Connector deployed on a machine you have access to is to use the command line interface iofogctl.
iofogctl help
For the purpose of this demo, all ioFog components are spun up in separate Docker containers. The Controller's container is called iofog-controller.

Eclipse ioFog
Kilton Hopkins is a Project Lead for ioFog
Description: The Eclipse ioFog set of technologies is a fog computing layer that can be installed on any hardware running Linux. Once installed, it provides a universal runtime for microservices to run on the edge. In addition to a common runtime, ioFog also provides a set of useful services including a message bus, dynamic configuration of the microservices, and remote debugging.
Automated interconnection of ioFog instances is provided by the ComSat component. This relieves developers from writing code just to move data from one place to another.
Orchestration and management of microservices (the edge software) is provided by the ioAuthoring application and the ioFog instances receive their instructions through the fabric controller.
Working together, these components provide a full set of technologies for building and running IoT software the executes wherever the developer chooses.
In greater detail, the fog computing layer is comprised of the following:
1. A fog computing software agent that runs on various operating systems and provides a universal runtime for IoT microservices. This is called "ioFog".
2. A fog computing node controller that runs on popular Linux distributions and gives dynamic instruction to the ioFog instances. It has an API that allows for various tooling to be built for controlling the fog computing fabric. This is called "Fabric Controller".
3. An internetworking utility that runs on popular Linux distributions and provides a way for ioFog instances to interconnect, even through private network layers and firewalls. This is called "ComSat".
4. A design-time interface for creating, saving, editing, and deploying microservices schemas that are called "tracks". It runs on popular Linux distributions and uses the Fabric Controller API to do its work. This is called "ioAuthoring".
5. Software Development Kits (SDKs) in multiple programming languages that provide developers with the convenience of programming against objects instead of using the native REST API that exists within the ioFog.
6. A local software development tool that mimics the fog computing runtime and gives developers a way to test their code against simulated situations before making the effort to package their code as a microservice. This is called "Test Message Generator".
Why Here?: The community will gain a standard development model for IoT edge processing that frees them from the constraints of specific languages and specific hardware, and a set of technologies for provisioning and managing the edge processing.

1. A fog computing software agent that runs on various operating systems and provides a universal runtime for IoT microservices. This is called "ioFog".
2. A fog computing node controller that runs on popular Linux distributions and gives dynamic instruction to the ioFog instances. It has an API that allows for various tooling to be built for controlling the fog computing fabric. This is called "Fabric Controller".

5. Software Development Kits (SDKs) in multiple programming languages that provide developers with the convenience of programming against objects instead of using the native REST API that exists within the ioFog.
6. A local software development tool that mimics the fog computing runtime and gives developers a way to test their code against simulated situations before making the effort to package their code as a microservice. This is called "Test Message Generator".
Why Here?: The community will gain a standard development model for IoT edge processing that frees them from the constraints of specific languages and specific hardware, and a set of technologies for provisioning and managing the edge processing.
By hosting our project with this community, we expect to augment our ecosystem of microservice developers and receive feedback that helps strengthen the technology.
There is strong potential for collaboration with other Eclipse IoT projects. Here are some examples:
hawkBit - by leveraging microservices running on the ioFog, remote updates can be achieved for devices that have complex update processes or connectivity that requires intellitent interfacing.
Vorto - the meta definitions of real-world objects can be represented in the ioAuthoring interface, with the implementation happening on a per-object basis through the use of microservices running on the edge near the actual physical object.
Kura - the ioFog (along with ComSat) can be used to add remote connectivity and servicability for Kura gateways that remain safely behind a firewall or NATed network. Microservices can be instantiated on the ioFog to work with Kura gateways and add layers of behavior for large groups of them.
Updated build of ioFog in September, 2016 with some additional features. This version is already in development.

Service Account User
To login with a service account and setup our project, download the service account key file from GCP. Further details on how to setup a service account are available in the GCP documentation.
You can test authenticate gcloud with the newly created service account.
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=service-account-key.json
If you no longer have the service account key file, it is possible to generate another key using gcloud or using the GCP console.
Packet API Token
The platform tools also supports deployment of agent nodes on packet. This step is entirely optional and is it possible to provide our own machines for ioFog Agents instead.
We will need Packet token to setup packet provider on terraform. First we have to upload out ssh key that will be used by automation to add to newly created instances.
Next, retrieve a Packet auth token and project ID from Packet website and save it for later.
Usage
Bootstrap Platform Tools
We can then run bootstrap to install all the required tools. It is possible to skip the installation step if we opt to instead provide the tools ourselves, please consult ./bootsrap.sh --help for details.
./bootstrap.sh --gcloud-service-account service-account-key.json
Names for all the containers created in the demo are iofog-agent, iofog-controller and iofog-connector.
The initialization scripts used to setup the ioFog stack / ECN are using the CLI interface. Feel free to refer to these for more inspiration.
Full reference of the CLI is available at the iofogctl github repository:
https://github.com/eclipse-iofog/iofogctl/tree/v1.3.0#usage
Interacting With The ioFog Stack - REST API
Full reference of the REST API for all ioFog stack components is available at the ioFog website:
https://iofog.org/docs/1.0.0/controllers/rest-api.html
https://iofog.org/docs/1.0.0/agents/local-api.html
https://iofog.org/docs/1.0.0/connectors/api-reference.html
You can try using the REST API directly on your machine with the ioFog stack running.
curl --url 'http://0.0.0.0:51121/api/v3/status'
Try ioFog - Tutorial Application Deployed On ioFog
Apart from creating just the ioFog stack, we can also deploy an ioFog application on the stack. Here we demonstrate it on the tutorial application from the ioFog website.
First, create all services for a tutorial ioFog application. You don't have to start the iofog stack manually, it will be created if necessary.

Modify Configuration File
First create a copy of the variables template file.
cp infrastructure/gcp/template.tfvars user.tfvars
Now we have to edit the user.tfvars file according to our credentials and desired infrastructure. There are three main sections in the file: general variables, agents list and packet variables. Let's start by modifying the following general variables:
Variables
Description
google_application_credentials
Path to the service account key file from Google Cloud Platform Setup
gcp_service_account
Name of the GCP service account
project_id
GCP project ID
environment
Name of the infrastructure (to identify the resources on GCP and Packet)
./start.sh tutorial
When you are done with the tutorial, you can tear down the sample application together with the ioFog stack.
./stop.sh
if you only wish to delete the tutorial application:
iofogctl delete application tutorial

Review Information
Release Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019Themes: Quality and ConsumabilityIn these release we are focusing on two main themes:
Quality: overall quality of the code base, the project health, the documentation, the CI, etc, etc. Our goal is to raise the baseline of what is expected from our components before we release them to users.
Consumability: traditionally, some ioFog components were hard to install and configure to run as a unified platform. We have focused heavily on making that a much easier experience for end users, upgraded the Demo environment tremendously and improved the overall documentation.

Packet plan of arm instances (Optional)
Deploy and Destroy Infrastructure
To deploy the new infrastructure, run:
./deploy.sh user.tfvars
Interact With Newly Deployed Infrastructure
Once the infrastructure is successfully deployed, we should be able to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. Terraform automatically setup our kubeconfig for us. To use the newly created Kubernetes cluster, we need to define KUBECONFIG environment variable to point to a kubeconfig file created by Terraform. The kubeconfig file is always in infrastructure/gcp/<environment>.kubeconfig, where <environemnt> corresponds to the settings passed in our user.tfvars file.
export KUBECONFIG="$PWD/infrastructure/gcp/<environment>.kubeconfig"
Should we need to retrieve kubeconfig for our new cluster anytime in the future or from another machine, we can use gcloud container clusters get-credentials environment --region gcp_region, where environment and gcp_region refer to previously described variables.
Terraform generated ecn.yaml file according to iofogctl specification. Most important are kubeconfig and keyfile parameters. The kubeconfig variable is the same as in Interact With Newly Deployed Infrastructure. keyfile refers to a private SSH key to access the given agent. For Packet agents, these must be uploaded to Packet according to Packet Setup (Optional). This is also where we can add additional agents (outside of the new infrastructure).
Destroy Infrastructure
To destroy the infrastructure (and all deployed ECNs), run:
./destroy.sh user.tfvars
Make sure the tfvars file is the same for both deploy and destroy invocations.

Integrated Snyk for continual security and vulnerability analysis
Cleaned up, refactored and retired old/crufty repos, branches and code we no longer needed
API Certification: The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".Architectural Issues: We paid down a ton of legacy tech debt in this release, removing a slew of old repos, and defunct branches from the repos we wanted to keep. Additionally, we aligned all compoents to build from a new set of baseline docker images. Additionally, we reimplemented CI on top of Azure pipelines to give us true CI, not just periodic builds (which had been the case on Travis).
For this release we have submitted all outstanding CQs and removed libs that were questionable from a license stand point.
Lastly, a new Test Runner repo contains a full stack integration test suite (or at least the initial version of it) that will test a fully deployed system post CI snapshot builds.
Security Issues: We have integrated Snyk as a tool into our build pipeline to immediately alert on security issues.
Non-Code Aspects: New release artifacts are available on PackageCloud. Single one line install for most components. We have upgrade documentation at iofog.org and simplified the Demo and tutorial flow and experience for a completely new ioFog user.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verifiedCommunities: We have added new committers to the project, and actively supported all users on the ioFog Discuss forums.

WebSockets
WS server listens on port 54332.
Get USB-to-Serial Web-socket Connection
This endpoint opens a message Web-socket connection to USB-to-Serial device. The messages and other commands sent
over this Web-socket are specified here. It is the responsibility of the container to establish this connection
and ensure it is running.
The PORT of USB-to-Serial device must be passed as part of the URL because otherwise it would have to be passed in
the Web-socket connection itself and that would make associated connections with different devices rather difficult.
Endpoint
Response
None - the Websocket will simply be opened successfully
Querystring Parameters
PORT - the PORT of USB-to-Serial device to connect to via the Websocket connection
(example shown here as '/dev/ttyusb0')
Signals from HAL to Client
- op code 4: (single byte command) indicates connection to device was opened (it's an answer to connection open op
code signal sent with configuration for opening connection to physical device); at this point HAL starts
listening on data from connected device.
- op code 6: indicates that HAL recieved some data from physical device (op code single byte followed by pure bytes
of data recieved from device)
- standart close frame: indicates that current connection was closed.
> status code 1000 with close frame : means that device normally closed connection
> status code 4000 with close frame : there was an exception, error will be passed in reason.
Signals from Client to HAL
- op code 3: signals HAL to open connection to device with specified configuration in passed data (op code single
byte followed by bytes of json configuration to open connection to device ); in case with USB-to-Serial: PORT
property is required.
- op code 5: signals HAL to send recieved data to connected device (op code single byte followed by pure bytes of
data to send to device)
- standart close frame: indicates that client wants to close current connection.
> status code 1000 with close frame : means that device normally closed connection
> status code 4000 with close frame : there was an exception, error will be passed in reason.
JSON Configuration for USB-to-Serial device
All available configuration properties:
'port'(required to open connection)
'baudrate'
'bytesize'
'parity'
'stopbits'
'timeout'
'xonxoff'
'rtscts'
'dsrdtr'
'write_timeout'
'inter_byte_timeout'
'data_read_timeout'(this property tells HAL to pause for specified timeout in seconds before reading data from buffer)
Example:
{ 'port': '/dev/ttyUSB0' }
