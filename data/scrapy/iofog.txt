Bug Fixes
Fixed Agent docker depending on unstable location of Java
iofog.org
Features
Added documentation to support new Environment variables for Docker Containers
Added documentation to support new CMD override for Docker Containers
Updates to the Tutorial flow to support new Demo
Project Wide Work
Ported all CI to Azure Pipelines
Simplified Packaging, Tagging and Release process for public artifacts
Implemented initial cross component integration tests suite in Test Runner repo
Added support for pushing snapshot/rc artifacts to PackageCloud
Integrated Snyk for continual security and vulnerability analysis
Cleaned up, refactored and retired old/crufty repos, branches and code we no longer needed
API Certification:
The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".
Architectural Issues:
We paid down a ton of legacy tech debt in this release, removing a slew of old repos, and defunct branches from the repos we wanted to keep. Additionally, we aligned all compoents to build from a new set of baseline docker images. Additionally, we reimplemented CI on top of Azure pipelines to give us true CI, not just periodic builds (which had been the case on Travis).

2.0.0 | projects.eclipse.org
For this release we have submitted all outstanding CQs and removed libs that were questionable from a license stand point.
Lastly, a new Test Runner repo contains a full stack integration test suite (or at least the initial version of it) that will test a fully deployed system post CI snapshot builds.
Security Issues:
We have integrated Snyk as a tool into our build pipeline to immediately alert on security issues.
Non-Code Aspects:
New release artifacts are available on PackageCloud. Single one line install for most components. We have upgrade documentation at iofog.org and simplified the Demo and tutorial flow and experience for a completely new ioFog user.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
Not verified
Communities:
We have added new committers to the project, and actively supported all users on the ioFog Discuss forums.

Release Plan
Review Information
Majore ioFog release 2.0.0 brings new ioFog Edge Compute Network (ECN) model, with legacy Connector being replaced by much more robust Router based on Apache Qpid, with Kubernetes integration enabled by Red Hat's project Skupper.
The major release also stabilizes Controller to Agent API specification, so that custom implementations of Agents are now possible, such as Agents in Golang or on Android.
Many other smaller features have been added to the ioFog Engine, such as better Docker image pruning, registry management and more robust centralised logging support.

Review Information
1.3.0 brings new quality of life improvements as well as a set of backend changes that extend and unify ioFog's capabilities.
ioFog Kubernetes support has been improved by expanding the ioFog Kubernetes Operator's capabilities. Now orchestration of ioFog Kubernetes is handled by the Operator. Previously, Helm and iofogctl were handling this orchestration themselves, in disparate ways.

Releases
ioFog v2
Get Started with ioFog v2
Major ioFog release 2 brings new ioFog Edge Compute Network (ECN) model, with legacy Connector being replaced by much more robust Apache Qpid Dispatch Router and Red Hat's project Skupper Proxy.
What's New?
ioFog Controller has been updated to allow for external databases to be used instead of the embedded SQLite default database. Helm and iofogctl have been updated to allow users to integrate their external databases during the deployment process.
The unified CLI, iofogctl, has been improved to allow users more granular control over resources like Connectors and Microservices. Users can now view realtime deployment status of Microservices through iofogctl due to improvements to both ioFog Controller and Agent.
The iofog-go-sdk has been updated to provide an HTTP client for ioFog Controller's REST API.

Architectural Issues:
We have made major improvements in the architecture of Controller, simplifying deployment and unifying a new visualizer into the distro. Additionally, ioFog agent install now seamlessly supports making the necessary changes to ARM Docker envionrments to remove a bunch of headache for end users.
The addition of iofogctl as a unified CLI drove us to expose further management and monitoring APIs via REST, so the entire platform is now configurabler and manageable via REST.
Security Issues:
Inceased identity verification between ioFog Connector and ioFog Controller to allow for widely distributed deployments to operate more securely.
Non-Code Aspects:
We have added further documentation tutorials that include
ioFog platform deployment to kubernetes
Installing ioFog via HELM to Kubernetes
iofogctl command line tool and management/deployment of ioFog
Updated all of the demo/tutorial documentation
Improved the API documentation

The major release also stabilizes Controller to Agent API specification, so that custom implementations of Agents are now possible, such as Agents in Golang or on Android.
Many other smaller features have been added to the ioFog Engine, such as better Docker image pruning, registry management and more robust centralised logging support.

Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
There are many great ways to build IoT software in the cloud. And there are many great ways to store and analyze the large amounts of data produced by sensors and devices.
Yet there are few ways to build IoT software that runs in a real-world location such as a warehouse or a hospital room. Developing and deploying software to these edge locations can be time consuming, expensive, and inflexible.
ioFog was created to solve these problems. The goal is to make developing IoT edge software feel like developing for the cloud, but with even more power.
Scope:
1. A software agent, ioFog, that provides a universal runtime for IoT micro services
2. A node controller allowing to control ioFog instances
3. SDKs in multiple programming languages, allowing developers to program containerized edge applications and micro-services
4. Development tools to author and simulate various deployment scenarios
Description:
The Eclipse ioFog set of technologies is a fog computing layer that can be installed on any hardware running Linux. Once installed, it provides a universal runtime for microservices to run on the edge. In addition to a common runtime, ioFog also provides a set of useful services including a message bus, dynamic configuration of the microservices, and remote debugging.
Automated interconnection of ioFog instances is provided by the ComSat component. This relieves developers from writing code just to move data from one place to another.
Orchestration and management of microservices (the edge software) is provided by the ioAuthoring application and the ioFog instances receive their instructions through the fabric controller.
Working together, these components provide a full set of technologies for building and running IoT software the executes wherever the developer chooses.

In greater detail, the fog computing layer is comprised of the following:
1. A fog computing software agent that runs on various operating systems and provides a universal runtime for IoT microservices. This is called "ioFog".
2. A fog computing node controller that runs on popular Linux distributions and gives dynamic instruction to the ioFog instances. It has an API that allows for various tooling to be built for controlling the fog computing fabric. This is called "Fabric Controller".
3. An internetworking utility that runs on popular Linux distributions and provides a way for ioFog instances to interconnect, even through private network layers and firewalls. This is called "ComSat".
4. A design-time interface for creating, saving, editing, and deploying microservices schemas that are called "tracks". It runs on popular Linux distributions and uses the Fabric Controller API to do its work. This is called "ioAuthoring".
5. Software Development Kits (SDKs) in multiple programming languages that provide developers with the convenience of programming against objects instead of using the native REST API that exists within the ioFog.
6. A local software development tool that mimics the fog computing runtime and gives developers a way to test their code against simulated situations before making the effort to package their code as a microservice. This is called "Test Message Generator".
Why Here?:
The community will gain a standard development model for IoT edge processing
that frees them from the constraints of specific languages and specific hardware,
and a set of technologies for provisioning and managing the edge processing.
By hosting our project with this community, we expect to augment our ecosystem of microservice developers and receive feedback that helps strengthen the technology.
There is strong potential for collaboration with other Eclipse IoT projects. Here are some examples:
hawkBit - by leveraging microservices running on the ioFog, remote updates can be achieved for devices that have complex update processes or connectivity that requires intellitent interfacing.
Vorto - the meta definitions of real-world objects can be represented in the ioAuthoring interface, with the implementation happening on a per-object basis through the use of microservices running on the edge near the actual physical object.

Test Runner
The ioFog Test Runner provides a convenient way to run multiple smoke test suites on a deployed Edge Compute Network (ECN).
The suite by default does not run any non-smoke tests, i.e. tests that would invalidate or potentially break the ECN, therefore it can be used on staging a productions ECNs to verify correct deployment.
The following test suites are available:
Controller REST API smoke tests
Agent CLI smoke tests
Basic microservice deployment integration tests
Note that some of additional test suites are automatically skipped as of this release of Test Runner.
Prerequisites
You must have iofogctl configured with its default namespace pointing to the ECN you want to test

ioFog Port Manager
Port Manager is a component of the ioFog Kubernetes Control Plane. It is responsible for managing HTTP Proxy instances to satisfy requirements specified by Public Ports created through the ioFog Controller API.
Port Manager is deployed automatically when using iofogctl >= 2.0.0.
Build from Source
Go 1.12.1+ is a prerequisite.
See all
make
Example usage of the test runner with iofogctl configuration:
Example usage of the test runner with endpoint configurations configuration:
Note that whenever AGENTS is specified, you need to mount appropriate ssh keys to /root/.ssh of the test-runner containers. The keys can be in any default SSH position: ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
Test Results
The output of this test-suite currently is a single XML File that is Junit-XML compliant. This can be used in development pipelines on most DevOps infrastructure to display test results in easy to consume factor.
This is used in Azure Pipelines to display each builds pass/fail for both entire test suites as well as for specific tests we may see multiple failures in, to help identify issues that may not be consistent.
The test output is file is
TEST-RESULTS.xml
and is stored in
/root/test-results
of the test-runner container.

helm init instructions
for more details.
In order to create the cluster role binding on GKE, you need to have
roles/container.admin
permission. If your account doesn't have the role, it can be added using the following:
Next, create service account for Tiller and bind cluster-admin role.
Initialize Helm And Install Tiller
Now is the time to use our service account to initialize Helm.
Note that on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), we will also need to specify node selectors for Tiller.
Install ioFog Stack
Add this Helm repository to our Helm repository index and install the ioFog stack and Kubernetes services
We can list all available versions of the ioFog Helm chart using
helm search -l iofog/iofog
. From Helm 2.16 onwards, only charts with production versions are listed by default. To list all versions, including development versions, use
helm search -l --devel iofog
To install a specific version of ioFog, use
helm install

Test Message Generator
As developers build ioElement containers, they start by building the code in a non-container environment. They need to test the code before spending the time turning it into a published container, but they can't actually test the processing of messages or connection to the ioFog instance without going through the publishing and deployment process.
Test Message Generator is a surrogate version of the ioFog Local API. It mimics the API endpoints of the real ioFog Local API, including offering the Control Websocket and Message Websocket. It runs on "localhost" so it can be reached directly on the computer that is being used to build the ioElement container.
A developer can precisely mimic the production environment on their build machine by mapping a host. If they map "127.0.0.1" with the host name "iofog" then their local code will be able to operate with the same "
http://iofog:54321/
" endpoints found in the SDKs and described in the API specification.

bluetooth-rest-api (REST-BLUE)
Prerequisites:
container needs to be run with 2 options to grant access: --net=host --privileged
Upon startup the container will start scanning if bluetooth is powered on and upon discovering devices it will store them locally and generate an internal ID. In most cases the container will work with this locally stored devices unless the scanning is restarted. If container received command to restart scanning it will delete all previously stored devices and start scanning anew ( which results in generating new local IDs for devices). Container will return 'Timeout exception' in case if it didn't get any results of processing.
For example, if you try to hit
endpoint you can get 'Timeout exception' for next reasons:
device with specified mac was't found while scanning anew
device is inactive and container hang up on trying to connect to it
after connecting to device container hang up on discovering services
Container provides next REST endpoints :
Set Device Identifier (POST)
This endpoint provides the possibility to set config for bluetooth-rest-api system container, upon receiving config container will wipe out all previously stored devices and restart scanning. 'name' - will tell container differentiate devices' uniqueness by localname, 'mac' - will tell container differentiate devices' uniqueness by mac address

iofogctl
is a CLI for the installation, configuration, and operation of ioFog
Edge Compute Networks (ECNs)
. It can be used to remotely manage multiple ECNs from a single host. It is built for ioFog users and DevOps engineers wanting to manage ECNs. It is modelled on existing tools such as Terraform or kubectl that can be used to automate infrastructure-as-code.
Install
Mac
Mac users can use Homebrew:
Linux
The Debian package can be installed like so:
And similarly, the RPM package can be installed like so:
Usage
Documentation
The best way to learn how to use
iofogctl
is through the
iofog.org
learning resources.
set up custom host, port and container's ID (in case of no params default values for host and port will be used: 'ioFog', 54321) and pass main callback to trigger when ioFogClient initialization is done:
REST calls
post new ioMessage to ioFog via REST call:
get list of ioMessages by time frame for accessible publishers from ioFog via REST call
get list of next unread ioMessages via REST call
get container's config via REST call
WebSocket(WS) calls
open WS Message Channel to ioFog with callback that will be executed on open socket (in this example - sends new message via this channel)
Open WS Control Channel to ioFog

Logging Container
Logging Container is a system container that gathers logs and provides REST API for adding and querying logs from containers.
Use Logger Container if you want to gather all the logs and find them easily.
As internal port use 54322.
Config:
The config for the container should look the following way:
Config explanation:
"access_tokens"
- required. array of strings, each is acceptable access token that is allowed to interact with logging service
"cleanfrequency"
- optional. string, frequency of database cleanup. Parameter is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
"ttl"
- optional. string, log entry time to live. Parameter is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

Connector installs on any common version of Linux. It handles the traffic between Fog nodes. You can have as many Connector instances in a Iofog deployment as you want.
When you put Connector, anywhere on your network (it can be even public Internet), anywhere that is visible to fog nodes, the Connector facilitates this talk to each other, it facilitates opening a port on public internet to talk to the fog. Thus you can reach microservices remotely, and microservices come in together from different locations.
Status
Connector Setup
1. In order to install Connector, you need to have Java installed on your machine.
2 Install Connector
3. Setup certificates if needed (After installation there are configs.json, server-cert.pem and server-key.pem files present in the /etc/iofog-connector directory)
4. Add iofog-connector.conf config file to Connector
5. Add Connector to Iofog-Controller database
Logs
Log files are located at '/var/log/iofog-connector'
System Requirements (Recommended)
Processor: 64 bit Dual Core or better
RAM: 1 GB minimum
Hard Disk: 5 GB minimum
Java Runtime (JRE) 8 or higher
Platforms Supported (Ubuntu Linux)
POST JSON raw body
"withresponse" isn't required (in case it's omitted the default value will be false)
Response
Get list of descriptors (GET)
This endpoint returns a list of discovered descriptors for specified characteristic cID, service sID and device dID/Mac Address
Endpoint 13
Endpoint 14
Response
Read the value from descriptor (GET)
This endpoint reads the value from specified descriptor dsID for specified characteristic cID, service sID and device dID/Mac Address
Endpoint 15
Endpoint 16
Response
Subscribe to characteristic's notify event (GET)
This endpoint sets notify property to true for specified characteristic's cID for specified service sID and device dID/Mac Address and returns url where buffered values can be picked up. If timeout parameter is specified (in millisecond) it'll be applied, otherwise RESTBlue will use the default value 1 min (60000 milliseconds). This timeout is specified to handle usecase when device is still connected and advertising, but RESTBlue stopped receiving any data on notify subscription. When picking up buffered notify data:
If RESTBlue doesn't receive any data for more than specified timeout it will unsubscribe and remove notify buffer url and return 500 status code with error:TIMEOUT_DATA.

WebSockets
WS server listens on port 54332.
Get USB-to-Serial Web-socket Connection
This endpoint opens a message Web-socket connection to USB-to-Serial device. The messages and other commands sent over this Web-socket are specified here. It is the responsibility of the container to establish this connection and ensure it is running.
The PORT of USB-to-Serial device must be passed as part of the URL because otherwise it would have to be passed in the Web-socket connection itself and that would make associated connections with different devices rather difficult.

The ioFog Agent product
Imagine a world where you can choose self-contained pieces of code (called microservices) and make them run anywhere you want at the push of a button. Where you can remotely control the code that is running on twenty iPhones in workers' pockets, thirty servers running in a factory building, and ten computers running in the trucks that ship your products... and you can do it all with the same single technology. Imagine a world where you move the processing close to where the data is happening, and where you can finally separate streams of information from the end applications that use them. This world will be brought to life by iofog, and a big part of the vision is the ioFog product that runs on the various computers.
This repository is the production code base for the x86 Linux version of the ioFog product.
ioFog is a service that runs constantly in the background on a Linux machine. It is the agent that turns a Linux computer into a piece of the iofog I/O compute fog.
There should be an ioFog code base for every processing platform that becomes part of the I/O compute fog. Network connectivity, process invocation, thread management, and other details of an ioFog will vary from platform to platform. The same ioFog principles apply to every version, but the implementation of the principles should match the native languages and structures best suited for the platform.
Status
Principles of an ioFog Agent:
Never go down
Respond immediately to the fog controller
Operate flawlessly when offline
Report status frequently and reliably
Execute instructions with no understanding of the bigger picture
Provide a high-performance message bus and local API
Enforce the configured resource consumption constraints strictly
Install

Connector API
Connector exposes API and it’s API where you have a set of identities. Fog Controller has the proper identity and it’s able to tell Connector “I want you to open up some connections”. Fog Controller uses Connector API to tell it to do and Connector simply replies whether it is successful or not successful.
ioFog Agent connects to Connectors and through connecting Connectors traffic is able to move between fog nodes. In addition Connector has the capability to open traffic to the outside world so the outside users can get route into fog node.
Connector offers two connectivity types:
1) The first type, called a public pipe, provides a way to securely access Fog software and data from anywhere on in the world. Connector punches through firewalls and NATed networks to perform automatic internetworking of the Fog.
Let’s describe what mapping is. Mapping is a way for describing a port opening, no matter whether you create a public or private pipe. It is an object that has an internal and an external port.

ioFog Demo
This repository demonstrates the capabilities of ioFog. It spins up the ioFog stack (Agent, Controller, and Connector) on a local machine in a Docker Compose environment. This basic ioFog stack setup constitutes a small, but fully configured Edge Compute Network (ECN).
Optionally, this demo also creates a sample application (microservices deployed on the ioFog stack).

to deploy edge Agents. Then, you can use
kubectl
or
iofogctl
to deploy microservices to your edge Agents.
Multiple Edge Compute Networks
If we want to have multiple instances of ioFog on the same Kubernetes cluster, it is necessary to tell Helm not to install custom resource definitions. This can be done by overriding the
createCustomResources
(default:
true
) variable.
Only use this option when the ioFog custom resource exists, either from another Helm installation or manual installation using
iofogctl
.
To check if the custom resources exist, run
kubectl get crd | grep iofog
. If the resources exist, we must use
createCustomResources=false
.

Cut a new major/minor version and publish (maintainers only)
To create a new version of documentation (usually for new major release), we need to first update the npm package version and then create a new version of the documentation. Note that the staging documentation in
content/docs/next
will be used to create the new version. If there are any fixed in the previous documentation, it is advisable to propagate them into the staging documentation first before proceeding.
After this you are ready to checkin the new version.

Try ioFog - Simple Edge Compute Network
The main interaction with this demo repository is encapsulated into a set of simple scripts:
start.sh
,
test.sh
and
stop.sh
. Interactions with the ioFog components can be done using a command line interface available in all the services of the stack, or using a REST API.
Spin Up The ioFog Stack
Spin up the blank ioFog stack (Agent, Controller, and Connector) on the local machine.
Verify the iofog stack is provisioned correctly. The automated tests run a smoke test suite on the blank ioFog stack, testing basic operations.
You can also verify manually that the ioFog stack containers are correctly started.
When you are finished, tear down the ioFog stack and all services deployed on it.
Build from local images
If you have a local image version of the Agent, Controller and Connector, you can chose to build the containers using those local images. To do so, you will need a docker image for the Agent, the Connector and the Controller. You can provide
start.sh
with an option for each local package you want to use.

ECN Status
Interacting With The ioFog Stack - CLI
The simplest way to interact with Agent, Controller, and Connector deployed on a machine you have access to is to use the command line interface
iofogctl
.
For the purpose of this demo, all ioFog components are spun up in separate Docker containers. The Controller's container is called
iofog-controller
.
Names for all the containers created in the demo are
iofog-agent
,
iofog-controller
and
iofog-connector
.
The initialization scripts used to setup the ioFog stack / ECN are using the CLI interface. Feel free to refer to these for more inspiration.
Full reference of the CLI is available at the iofogctl github repository:

Eclipse ioFog Platform
The Eclipse ioFog Platform project provides means to spin up and deploy minimal infrastructure. Currently, we demonstrate how to achieve this on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), although since we are using
Terraform
under the covers you can easily extend/contribute to support your preferred cloud infrastructure provider.
Required Tools
In order to setup the infrastructure we will need the following tools:
Terraform
(version 0.12.*,
installation instructions
)
GCloud SDK (
quickstart guide
)

Interacting With The ioFog Stack - REST API
Full reference of the REST API for all ioFog stack components is available at the ioFog website:
https://iofog.org/docs/1.0.0/controllers/rest-api.html
https://iofog.org/docs/1.0.0/agents/local-api.html
https://iofog.org/docs/1.0.0/connectors/api-reference.html
You can try using the REST API directly on your machine with the ioFog stack running.
Try ioFog - Tutorial Application Deployed On ioFog
Apart from creating just the ioFog stack, we can also deploy an ioFog application on the stack. Here we demonstrate it on the tutorial application from the ioFog website.
First, create all services for a tutorial ioFog application. You don't have to start the iofog stack manually, it will be created if necessary.
When you are done with the tutorial, you can tear down the sample application together with the ioFog stack.
if you only wish to delete the tutorial application:

Required Credentials
GCP Service Account
First, we need to setup gcloud with our project. We can either establish a service account or use a personal account with GCP. In both cases, the minimal set of IAM roles required is:
Compute Admin
Kubernetes Engine Admin
Service Account User
To login with a service account and setup our project, download the service account key file from GCP. Further details on how to setup a service account are available in the
GCP documentation
.
You can test authenticate gcloud with the newly created service account.
If you no longer have the service account key file, it is possible to
generate another key using gcloud
or using the GCP console.

. This step is entirely optional and is it possible to provide our own machines for ioFog Agents instead.
We will need Packet token to setup packet provider on terraform. First we have to
upload out ssh key
that will be used by automation to add to newly created instances.
Next, retrieve a Packet
auth token
and project ID from Packet website and save it for later.
Usage
Bootstrap Platform Tools
We can then run bootstrap to install all the required tools. It is possible to skip the installation step if we opt to instead provide the tools ourselves, please consult

Once the infrastructure is successfully deployed, we should be able to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. Terraform automatically setup our
kubeconfig
for us. To use the newly created Kubernetes cluster, we need to define
KUBECONFIG
environment variable to point to a kubeconfig file created by Terraform. The kubeconfig file is always in
infrastructure/gcp/<environment>.kubeconfig
, where
<environemnt>
corresponds to the settings passed in our
user.tfvars
file.
Should we need to retrieve kubeconfig for our new cluster anytime in the future or from another machine, we can use
gcloud container clusters get-credentials environment --region gcp_region
, where
environment
and
gcp_region
refer to previously described variables.
Terraform generated
ecn.yaml
file according to
iofogctl specification
. Most important are
kubeconfig
and
keyfile
parameters. The
kubeconfig
variable is the same as in
Interact With Newly Deployed Infrastructure
.
keyfile
refers to a private SSH key to access the given agent. For Packet agents, these must be uploaded to Packet according to
Packet Setup (Optional)
. This is also where we can add additional agents (outside of the new infrastructure).
Destroy Infrastructure
To destroy the infrastructure (and all deployed ECNs), run:
Make sure the
tfvars
file is the same for both deploy and destroy invocations.
Helpful Commands
Login to gcloud:
gcloud auth login
Kubeconfig for gke cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <<CLUSTER_NAME>> --region <<REGION>>
Delete a particular terraform resource:
terraform destroy -target=null_resource.iofog -var-file=vars.tfvars -auto-approve

Review Information
(active tab)
Description:
1.3.0 brings new quality of life improvements as well as a set of backend changes that extend and unify ioFog's capabilities.
ioFog Kubernetes support has been improved by expanding the ioFog Kubernetes Operator's capabilities. Now orchestration of ioFog Kubernetes is handled by the Operator. Previously, Helm and iofogctl were handling this orchestration themselves, in disparate ways.
ioFog Controller has been updated to allow for external databases to be used instead of the embedded SQLite default database. Helm and iofogctl have been updated to allow users to integrate their external databases during the deployment process.
The unified CLI, iofogctl, has been improved to allow users more granular control over resources like Connectors and Microservices. Users can now view realtime deployment status of Microservices through iofogctl due to improvements to both ioFog Controller and Agent.
The iofog-go-sdk has been updated to provide an HTTP client for ioFog Controller's REST API.

Eclipse ioFog
Proposal:
ioFog
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
There are many great ways to build IoT software in the cloud. And there are many great ways to store and analyze the large amounts of data produced by sensors and devices.
Yet there are few ways to build IoT software that runs in a real-world location such as a warehouse or a hospital room. Developing and deploying software to these edge locations can be time consuming, expensive, and inflexible.
ioFog was created to solve these problems. The goal is to make developing IoT edge software feel like developing for the cloud, but with even more power.
Scope:
1. A software agent, ioFog, that provides a universal runtime for IoT micro services
2. A node controller allowing to control ioFog instances
3. SDKs in multiple programming languages, allowing developers to program containerized edge applications and micro-services
4. Development tools to author and simulate various deployment scenarios
Description:
The Eclipse ioFog set of technologies is a fog computing layer that can be installed on any hardware running Linux. Once installed, it provides a universal runtime for microservices to run on the edge. In addition to a common runtime, ioFog also provides a set of useful services including a message bus, dynamic configuration of the microservices, and remote debugging.
Automated interconnection of ioFog instances is provided by the ComSat component. This relieves developers from writing code just to move data from one place to another.
Orchestration and management of microservices (the edge software) is provided by the ioAuthoring application and the ioFog instances receive their instructions through the fabric controller.

Back to the top
Working together, these components provide a full set of technologies for building and running IoT software the executes wherever the developer chooses.
In greater detail, the fog computing layer is comprised of the following:
1. A fog computing software agent that runs on various operating systems and provides a universal runtime for IoT microservices. This is called "ioFog".
2. A fog computing node controller that runs on popular Linux distributions and gives dynamic instruction to the ioFog instances. It has an API that allows for various tooling to be built for controlling the fog computing fabric. This is called "Fabric Controller".
3. An internetworking utility that runs on popular Linux distributions and provides a way for ioFog instances to interconnect, even through private network layers and firewalls. This is called "ComSat".
4. A design-time interface for creating, saving, editing, and deploying microservices schemas that are called "tracks". It runs on popular Linux distributions and uses the Fabric Controller API to do its work. This is called "ioAuthoring".
5. Software Development Kits (SDKs) in multiple programming languages that provide developers with the convenience of programming against objects instead of using the native REST API that exists within the ioFog.
6. A local software development tool that mimics the fog computing runtime and gives developers a way to test their code against simulated situations before making the effort to package their code as a microservice. This is called "Test Message Generator".
Why Here?:
The community will gain a standard development model for IoT edge processing
that frees them from the constraints of specific languages and specific hardware,
and a set of technologies for provisioning and managing the edge processing.
By hosting our project with this community, we expect to augment our ecosystem of microservice developers and receive feedback that helps strengthen the technology.
There is strong potential for collaboration with other Eclipse IoT projects. Here are some examples:
hawkBit - by leveraging microservices running on the ioFog, remote updates can be achieved for devices that have complex update processes or connectivity that requires intellitent interfacing.
Vorto - the meta definitions of real-world objects can be represented in the ioAuthoring interface, with the implementation happening on a per-object basis through the use of microservices running on the edge near the actual physical object.
Kura - the ioFog (along with ComSat) can be used to add remote connectivity and servicability for Kura gateways that remain safely behind a firewall or NATed network. Microservices can be instantiated on the ioFog to work with Kura gateways and add layers of behavior for large groups of them.
Initial Contribution:
All code and copyrights are owned by the contributing organization (iotracks, inc.).
The existing code that will be contributed consists of the ioFog Linux service, the ComSat Linux service, the ioAuthoring application for creating and managing ioFog instances and publishing microservices, and the fabric controller application for orchestrating the instantiation of microservices on ioFog instances.
Github public repository:
https://github.com/iotracks/iofabric
Third-party libraries:
Netty (Apache 2 license)
HornetQ (Apache 2 license)
Docker-Java (Apache 2 license)
Licenses:
Eclipse Public License 1.0
Project Scheduling:
Updated build of ioFog in September, 2016 with some additional features. This version is already in development.
All system components available in extensible, distributed format by January, 2017. This includes ioFog, ComSat, ioAuthoring, and the Fabric Controller.
Java, Python, and Node.js SDKs contributed immediately.
Two additional SDKs prioritized and contributed in October, 2016.
Further SDKs contributed in January, 2017.
Future Work:
Enhanced fabric controller API
IDE integration
Community activities:
Hold industry-specific developer workshops to address particular current IoT challenges
Introduce adapter microservices to provide easy integration with other projects and backend systems

Wednesday, June 19, 2019
Themes:
Quality and Consumability
In these release we are focusing on two main themes: Quality: overall quality of the code base, the project health, the documentation, the CI, etc, etc. Our goal is to raise the baseline of what is expected from our components before we release them to users. Consumability: traditionally, some ioFog components were hard to install and configure to run as a unified platform. We have focused heavily on making that a much easier experience for end users, upgraded the Demo environment tremendously and improved the overall documentation.

Added support for pushing snapshot/rc artifacts to PackageCloud
Integrated Snyk for continual security and vulnerability analysis
Cleaned up, refactored and retired old/crufty repos, branches and code we no longer needed
API Certification:
The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".
Architectural Issues:
We paid down a ton of legacy tech debt in this release, removing a slew of old repos, and defunct branches from the repos we wanted to keep. Additionally, we aligned all compoents to build from a new set of baseline docker images. Additionally, we reimplemented CI on top of Azure pipelines to give us true CI, not just periodic builds (which had been the case on Travis).
For this release we have submitted all outstanding CQs and removed libs that were questionable from a license stand point.
Lastly, a new Test Runner repo contains a full stack integration test suite (or at least the initial version of it) that will test a fully deployed system post CI snapshot builds.
Security Issues:
We have integrated Snyk as a tool into our build pipeline to immediately alert on security issues.
Non-Code Aspects:
New release artifacts are available on PackageCloud. Single one line install for most components. We have upgrade documentation at iofog.org and simplified the Demo and tutorial flow and experience for a completely new ioFog user.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
Not verified
Communities:
We have added new committers to the project, and actively supported all users on the ioFog Discuss forums.
