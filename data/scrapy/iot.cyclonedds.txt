Eclipse Cyclone DDS is an implementation of the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification (see http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/ ) and the related specifications for interoperability (see http://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/ )
With 'DATA' being 'the currency of the IOT', having a proper data-sharing technology will be a key-asset in any IOT-platform. The OMG DDS standard is recognized as a highly applicable standard for reliable and robust data-sharing in business- and mission-critical environments (
see
http://www.iiconsortium.org/IIRA.htm
and
http://www.iiconsortium.org/IICF.htm
)
and with that a great fit with the Eclipse-IOT ecosystem.
Eclipse Cyclone DDS offers unique data-sharing capabilities compared to the already existing Eclipse solutions (i.e. for messaging).
With a history of proven applicability in the military C4I domain (that are not so much unlike upcoming large-scale IOT-systems where you can also distinguish between planning-, awareness- and execution-grids that all impose specific requirements w.r.t. interoperabillity, high-volume data-sharing and deterministic/real-time data-access) we are confident that starting from day-1 this offering can significantly reduce the complexity of many IOT-systems and with that reduce their integration efforts and risks.
Furthermore we are confident that the Eclipse-IOT ecosystem will benefit even more by active participation in the evolution of this technology and the (OMG-)standard its based upon.
