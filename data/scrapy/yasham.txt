Eclipse Yasham is a highly modular cloud native platform that interconnects a wide range of consumer IoT & smart home services via extensible cloud software adapters to abstract away the specific communication protocols & requirements of cloud based services by a simplified and generic integration model towards the Eclipse Yasham consumer IoT platform. The scope of the platform is mainly about the topics: Consumer IoT, Smart Home, Smart Building and Smart Living. The flexible and modular architecture of Eclipse Yasham will allow the usage of the platform in a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) or commercial Business-to-Business (B2B) deployment scenario

Status message
This proposal has been approved and the
Eclipse Yasham
project has been created.
Eclipse Yasham
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process
) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section.
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
The current consumer IoT and smart living market suffers under the commercial interests and competition of many companies, fighting for the “ownership” of customers and try to force proprietary ecosystems, leading to more fragmentation of consumer IoT solutions. Companies and developers want to integrate/interact with the mass of consumer IoT & smart living solutions but there is no normalized, future-proof link to connect and manage the smart living/C-IoT services. Developers and companies are therefor facing high integration efforts and interoperability challenges.
Accompanied by the large number of providers there are no common protocol standards. Alliances, standardization organizations or joint ventures try to bundle protocols and standards around consumer IoT and smart home services to cover a larger number of smart living solutions, but still developers or companies have to deal with a very heterogeneous landscape.
In fact, Industries want the highest coverage for their consumer IoT customers, but are restricted by partnerships which only cover smart living services of the partners network with strong limitations by competition, resulting in range and vendor lock-in. This has led to a highly fragmented market, which makes it also difficult for customers to choose a future proof solution. There wont be the one system, protocol or standard that could possibly fulfill all potential requirements. There is a need for platforms that allow the integration of different cloud based systems, protocols or standards and that enables a uniform way for integration, user interfaces and business services.
The origins of Yasham comes from the turkish word for living and stands for the mission of the project, which is to empower an open, flexible smart living and consumer IoT platform in a heterogenous consumer IoT world. The vision and philosophy behind the Eclipse Yasham project is related to the Eclipse IoT project
Eclipse SmartHome
and
openHAB
and takes those ideas and concepts to the cloud level, rather focusing on the embedded area. However Eclipse Yasham is not restricted to be a platform for Smart Home solutions and can be combined with other IoT gateway solutions.

Why Here?:
Many Eclipse projects are widely used within the smart home and conusmer IoT industry. Eclipse Yasham will add value to the Eclipse community by enabling a consumer IoT ecosystem for smart living and smart home solutions. Yasham will also broaden the Eclipse ecosystem, which covers currently many IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) projects. Therefor Eclipse Yasham will be a good extension to the Eclipse IoT domain, next to the related
Eclipse SmartHome
framework. The Eclipse Yasham project will benefit from the visibility in the community and an extended collaboration model with interested parties.
The target of Eclipse Yasham is to deliver a complete end-to-end consumer IoT (C-IoT) & smart living ecosystem. To achieve this in the IoT domain, there is the need to keep other cross concerns in mind, too. That's why Yasham is designed as a pluggable, modular platform and does not explicitly cover all related IoT concerns like connectivity and communication with devices, authentication and authorization, over the air updates for IoT gateway by itself. The main approach is to re-use and plug already existing Eclipse IoT projects into Eclipse Yasham to extend its use case for many possible scenarios, no matter if it is a consumer IoT solution for private or business customers.
Yasham could be combined with other Eclipse IoT projects to enable thie even more complete end-to-end platform as an ecosystem:
Eclipse SmartHome as the natural choice for embedded and gateway related integration in the local network
Eclipse Vert.X could serve as the main execution runtime for higher level business services
Kura can be connected to the platform and act as IoT gateway solution
Eclipse Hono as scalable device connectivity platform
Eclipse Hawkbit for rolling out software updates for e.g. Kura or Eclipse SmartHome gateways
Eclipse Kapua as integration foundational IoT framework
Eclipse Keti as authentication and authorization service
Licenses:
Eclipse Public License 2.0
Project Scheduling:
Eclipse Yasham aims to finish the initial contribution around Q1/2019.
A first possible release is planned for Q2/2019, mainly based on the refactored initial contribution.
Future Work:
The futrue work will include continous platform improvement and releases. There will firscloud integrations contributed by home-iX in a later stage. Some parts of the platform (e.g. openHAB-cloud parts) are planned to be re-designed and re-written form NodeJS to Java/Eclipse Vert.X. The upcoming roadmap and timeline of Eclipse Yasham can be summarized as shown in this overview:
