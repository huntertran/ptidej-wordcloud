Archived Eclipse Projects
You are seeing this because the project you were looking for has been archived. When projects are archived their data(downloads,source and website), is collected into a single tar.gz file.
Please note: Some projects did not have all of the above data.
Please note: The source files (if available) included in these files are direct copies of the available CVS/SVN data. You will need to load them into a local CVS/SVN repository to access the history.
Please note: Some of these archives are larger than 3GB

Desktop IDEs
Eclipse is famous for our Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but our C/C++ IDE and PHP IDE are pretty cool too. You can easily combine language support and other features into any of our default packages, and the Eclipse Marketplace allows for virtually unlimited customization and extension.
Download
Cloud IDEs
Develop your software wherever you go. It'll be there, in the cloud, right where you left it. Use your browser to develop with hosted workspaces or install desktop packaging to experience a modern development environment for Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
IDE Platforms
Create the next generation of developer tooling with our extensible platforms. Use your imagination to build services and tools that can be assembled into new IDEs or packages tailored to your identity. We provide multiple platforms to build plug-ins for desktop tools, distributed services used by cloud IDEs, and browser interfaces. You can then publish plug-ins to our Eclipse Marketplace of 1000s.
Eclipse Platform
Tools
Extend the extensible platform.
An impressive collection of tools can be easily installed into your Eclipse desktop IDE, including GUI builders and tools for modeling, charting and reporting, testing, and more.
Marketplace
Customize and extend Eclipse and make it your own.
Use the
Eclipse Marketplace Client
to find, install, and vote for new plug-ins from our vast ecosystem of providers.
Extend
Join the Community.
Extend the desktop and web-based IDEs by writing your own plug-ins using the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE), or mash up features to build the web IDE of your dreams.

Report a potential vulnerability now
Issue reports related to vulnerabilities must be marked as "committers-only", either automatically by clicking the provide link, by the reporter, or by a committer during the triage process. Note that issues marked "committers-only" are visible to all Eclipse committers. By default, a "committers-only" issue is also accessible to the reporter and individuals explicitly indicated in the "cc" list.
Disclosure
Disclosure is initially limited to the reporter and all Eclipse Committers, but is expanded to include other individuals, and the general public. The timing and manner of disclosure is governed by the
Eclipse Security Policy

visibility in, and interaction with the wider ecosystem
- Open Collaboration

Funding organizations
Open Source: the catalyst among academics, SMEs, and large organizations
Academics bring new innovations that enable better productivity and new processes in large organizations. SMEs industrialize the innovation transferred through open source projects to support a product-based or expertise-based business model.
Research Exploitation
The Eclipse Foundation experts enable the research team to create, evolve and maintain open source software projects that capture the results of the research.
The proven processes of the Eclipse Foundation and services for IP management and community building assist the research partners throughout the lifecycle of the research project. They ensure that the open source code can be used at any given time for research or commercial exploitation.
These processes are set out in the Eclipse Foundation governance model, the Eclipse Development Process and the Eclipse IP management practices. In addition, all code is made available under the
Eclipse Public License
, a commercial-friendly Open Source license approved by the Open Source Initiative.
More exploitation opportunities
Exploitation is driven by availability, open governance, quality, and IP cleanliness. Providing the platform under an OSS license such as the
Eclipse Public License
supports these goals very well. Users and adopters can trust the open governance model that provides a level playing field and commercial exploitation under this business-friendly open source license. The Eclipse IP process ensures that the IP created is tracked and properly managed.
Extensibility, sustainability and maturity
In some industries, platforms and tools must be available for a lifecycle of well over 20 years. With the experience of the Eclipse Foundation and the Eclipse ecosystem, it is possible to provide long-term support and design the platform in a way that allows for continuous and open innovation.
Industrial applications require measurable indicators of project maturity. The Eclipse Foundation deploys assessment processes and tools in Polarsys to help members evaluate the maturity of Eclipse projects and to support projects in achieving higher maturity levels.

CROSSMINER - Eclipse Crossmeter
Software engineers spend most of their time learning to understand the software they maintain or depend on (or will depend on). The goal of this learning process is to support decision-making. In this project, we focus on the increasing dependence on open-source software (OSS) over the last years and the decisions related to depending on open-source software. Eclipse CROSSMETER will support the eﬃcient and eﬀective decision-making regarding dependence on OSS projects and components thereof. This entails both decisions on the architecture level (to decide to select and OSS project) and on the code level (to design the use of the OSS project). In particular, CROSSMETER will provide techniques and tools for extracting knowledge from existing open source components, and use such knowledge to properly select and reuse existing software to develop new systems. The activity of the developer will be continuously monitored in order to raise alerts related to the quality of the selected OSS projects and to give suggestions that can reduce the development eﬀort and increase the quality of the ﬁnal software products.

RobMoSys
RobMoSys envisions an integrated approach built on top of the current code-centric robotic platforms, by applying model-driven methods and tools.
RobMoSys will enable the management of the interfaces between different robotics-related domains in an efficient and systematic way according to each system’s needs.
RobMoSys aims to establish Quality-of-Service properties, enabling a composition-oriented approach while preserving modularity.
RobMoSys will drive the non-competitive part of building a professional quality ecosystem by encouraging the community involvement.

APPSTACLE - Eclipse Kuksa
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

Origins
The
Eclipse Project
was originally created by IBM in November 2001 and supported by a consortium of software vendors. The Eclipse Project continues to be used by millions of developers.
The Eclipse Foundation was created in January 2004 as an independent not-for-profit corporation to act as the steward of the Eclipse community. The independent not-for-profit corporation was created to allow a vendor-neutral, open, and transparent community to be established around Eclipse.
Structure
The Eclipse community consists of individual developers and organizations spanning many industries. The Foundation employs a full-time
professional staff
to provide services to the community. The Eclipse Foundation is funded by annual dues from our
members
and governed by a
Board of Directors
. Strategic Developers and Strategic Consumers hold seats on this Board, as do representatives elected by Add-in Providers and Open Source committers. Eclipse committers are typically employed by organizations or are independent developers that volunteer their time to work on the Eclipse projects.
Services
The Eclipse Foundation provides four key services to the Eclipse community: 1)
IP Management
, 2)
Ecosystem Development
, 3)

Due Diligence Process:
This document provides a quick pictorial overview of the due diligence process.
Third Party Dependencies:
This document contains the guidelines for the review of third-party dependencies.
Committer Guidelines:
This document outlines the issues to be aware of and the processes one should follow when working as a committer on Eclipse.org projects. A committer is a person that has been granted commit rights to systems on the Eclipse.org servers such as git repositories, web pages, download servers, mailing lists and so forth.
Contribution Questionnaire:
A Contribution Questionnaires (CQ) is the main interface between Eclipse committers and the Intellectual Property Management Team. Prior to committing a significant contribution of content to an Eclipse Foundation project, the committer must fill out this questionnaire and submit it to the Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) for approval. In addition to the EMO, the relevant PMC must also provide a technical review and approval of the contribution. Follow the link to find out more about what we mean by "significant contribution". Bug fixes or minor enhancements do not require PMC or EMO approval.
"About" Templates:
This provides templates for the "about.html" ("About") files used to describe EPL-licensed content.
Default Copyright and License Notice:
The standard copyright and license notice should appear in all source files where possible. Variations on this notice may be required (for example where a license other than the EPL governs the use of the file).
IP Logs:
If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.
You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

, and 4)
IT Infrastructure
. Full-time staff are associated with each of these areas and work with the greater Eclipse community to assist in meeting the needs of stakeholders.
Intellectual Property (IP) Management
An important aspect of the Eclipse Foundation is the focus on enabling the use of open source technology in commercial software products and services. We consciously promote and encourage software vendors to use Eclipse technology for building their commercial software products and services. This is made possible by the fact that all Eclipse projects are licensed under the
Eclipse Public License (EPL)
, a commercial friendly OSI approved license.
The Eclipse Foundation also undertakes a number of steps to attempt to ensure the pedigree of the intellectual property contained within Eclipse projects. The first step in the due diligence process is trying to ensure that all contributions are made by the rightful copyright holder and under the Eclipse Public License (EPL). All committers are required to sign a
committer agreement
that stipulates all of their contributions are their original work and are being contributed under the EPL. If a committer is sponsored to work on an Eclipse project by a Member organization, then that organization is asked to sign a
Member Committer Agreement
to ensure the intellectual property rights of the organization are contributed under the EPL.
The second step is that the source code related to all contributions which are developed outside of the Eclipse development process is processed through the Eclipse Foundation
IP approval process
. This process includes analyzing selected code contributions to try to ascertain the provenance of the code, and license compatibility with the EPL. Contributions that contain code licensed under licenses not compatible with the EPL are intended to be screened out through this approval process and thus not added to an Eclipse project. The end result is a level of confidence that Eclipse open source projects release technology that can be safely distributed in commercial products.
Ecosystem Development
A unique aspect of the Eclipse community and the role of the Eclipse Foundation is the active marketing and promotion of Eclipse projects and wider Eclipse ecosystem. A healthy vibrant ecosystem that extends beyond the Eclipse open source community to include things like commercial products based on Eclipse, other open source projects using Eclipse, training and services providers, magazines and online portals, books, etc, are all key to the success of the Eclipse community.
To assist in the development of the Eclipse ecosystem, the Eclipse Foundation organizes a number of activities, including co-operative marketing events with Member companies,
community conferences
, online resource catalogs (
Eclipse Marketplace
and the
Eclipse YouTube Channel
), bi-annual Members meetings and other programs to promote the entire Eclipse community.

Development Community Support
The Eclipse community has a well-earned reputation for providing quality software in a reliable and predictable fashion. This is due to the commitment of the committers and organizations contributing to the open source projects. The Eclipse Foundation also provides services and support for the projects to help them achieve these goals.
The Foundation staff help implement the
Eclipse Development Process
. This process assists new project startup and ensures that all Eclipse projects are run in an open, transparent and meritocratic manner. As part of this process, the Foundation organizes member community reviews for projects to ensure consistent interaction between the projects and the broader membership.
The Eclipse community organizes an annual release train that provides a coordinated release of those Eclipse projects which wish to participate. The release train makes it easier for downstream consumers to adopt new releases of the projects because 1) all the projects are available on the same schedule, so you don't have to wait for independent project schedules, and 2) a level of integration testing occurs before the final release to help identify cross-project issues.
IT Infrastructure
The Eclipse Foundation manages the IT infrastructure for the Eclipse open source community, including Git code repositories and code review tools, bug trackers, Jenkins build farm, development-oriented mailing lists and forums, download site and website. The infrastructure is designed to provide reliable and scalable service for the committers developing the Eclipse technology and the consumers who use the technology.
A Unique Model for Open Source Development
The Eclipse Foundation has been established to serve the Eclipse open source projects and the Eclipse community. As an independent not-for-profit corporation, the Foundation and the Eclipse governance model ensures no single entity is able to control the strategy, policies or operations of the Eclipse community.
The Foundation is focused on creating an environment for successful open source projects and to promote the adoption of Eclipse technology in commercial and open source solutions. Through services like IP Due Diligence, annual release trains, development community support, and ecosystem development, the Eclipse model of open source development is a unique and proven model for open source development.

This list is used to discuss the Eclipse Foundation requirements, policies and procedures for access to test and certification kits (TCKs) from the Java Community Process (JCP), the OSGi Alliance and other specification organizations. Most such organizations place a requirement of confidentiality on the use of their TCKs. This list is _not_ to be used to discuss the results of any specific TCK, as that information will be restricted to a specific subset of committers.
