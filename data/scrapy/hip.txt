Types of Membership
Types of Membership
There are five types of membership to the Eclipse Foundation, four for organizations, and one for individuals.
Strategic Members
are organizations that view Eclipse as a strategic platform and are investing developer and other resources to further develop the Eclipse technology.
Enterprise Members
are organizations that rely heavily on Eclipse technology as a platform for their internal development projects and/or act strategically building products and services built on, or with, Eclipse. These organizations want to influence and participate in the development of the Eclipse ecosystem.
Solutions Members
are organizations that view Eclipse as an important part of their corporate and product strategy and offer products and services based on, or with, Eclipse. These organizations want to participate in the development of the Eclipse ecosystem.

Committer Members
Committer Members
Before you can become a Committer Member of the Eclipse Foundation, you must first become a Committer. While these things may sound similar, they are actually quite different.
Committers
are those people who have write access to the source repositories and other content on the Eclipse Foundation's website. A good description can be found in Exhibit D of the
Eclipse Membership Agreement
: "
In order for an individual to become a Committer, another Committer for the project (or component) must nominate that individual. Once an individual is nominated, the existing Committers for the project (or component) will vote using the process and rules established in the project’s corresponding Charter. When a new project is started, the corresponding PMC will nominate an initial set of Committers for approval by the Executive Director (or his delegates). Becoming a Committer is a privilege that is earned by contributing and showing discipline and good judgment. It is a responsibility that should be neither given nor taken lightly.
"
Read the "Becoming a Committer" section below for more details.
Committer Members
are those Committers who decide to join the Eclipse Foundation as Members. Note that people who work for a Member company who are Committers do not need to join as individual Committer Members. They already have all of the rights and privileges of a Committer Member. It is also important to understand that you do not have to join the Foundation as a Committer Member to be a Committer.
One of the important benefits of becoming a Committer Member is that you are eligible to vote in the elections for the Committer Representatives on the Eclipse Board of Directors.

are organizations that participate in, and want to show support for, the Eclipse ecosystem.
Committer Members
are individuals that are the core developers of the Eclipse projects and can commit changes to project source code.
Strategic Members
There are two types of strategic members: Strategic
Developers
and Strategic
Consumers
. Strategic
Developers
are major contributors of technology to Eclipse. Each strategic developer will lead an Eclipse Foundation open source project and have at least eight developers assigned full time to developing Eclipse technology and contribute annual dues of 0.12% of revenue (minimum $25K, maximum $250K). Strategic
Consumers
are major users of Eclipse technology. They contribute annual dues of 0.2% of revenues (minimum $50K, maximum $500K) but can reduce the dues by contributing one or two developers to Eclipse projects, reducing their dues by $125K for each developer, to the minimum of $50K.
Each strategic member has a representative on the Eclipse Foundation Board of Directors allowing them direct influence over the strategic direction of Eclipse.
Strategic Developer members have representation on the Eclipse Planning and Architecture Councils. This allows Strategic Developers to have direct input into the development processes and architecture of the Eclipse Foundation project community.
See the current
Becoming a Committer
If you are interested in becoming a Committer at Eclipse, the first and most important question is which project do you want to contribute to?
There are many
projects
; you should start with the project that is the most interesting and most exciting to you.
Second, a few operational details:
Please note that the
forums
are a good place to make contact with a project. To request a Eclipse Foundation password to post on the forums, report bugs and enter feature requests, please go to our
account creation form
.
We distinguish between two similar sounding, and related, organizations: the Eclipse Foundation is a member-funded not-for-profit corporation that supports the Eclipse Open Source Projects. The Projects are the open source community where the development happens. This distinction is important because you can be an active developer and contributor to the open source Projects without being a "member" of the Eclipse Foundation. (Most of our non-affiliated open source committers are also members of the Foundation, but it is not a requirement.) There is no cost to being an individual member of the Foundation.
Third, about becoming a developer and committer on the Eclipse Open Projects:
Becoming a Committer at Eclipse is a multi-stage process. The basic rule is that all new committers are voted in by the existing committers on a project. Similar to other open source communities, we operate as a meritocracy....which among other things translates to mean that you have to prove your abilities before you can become a committer.

Strategic Members.
Enterprise Members
Enterprise Members are generally larger organizations (>1,000 employees) that rely heavily on Eclipse technology as a platform for internal development projects and/or act strategically with products and services built on, or with, Eclipse. These organizations want to influence and participate in the development of the Eclipse ecosystem. .
Enterprise Members are looking for:
Access to detailed intellectual property data and policies to foster further trust and use of open source
Help with starting and participating Open Source projects and working groups relevant to their industries
The annual membership fee for Enterprise Members is tiered based on revenue (all values USD):
Annual Corporate Revenue Less Than $1 million, and less than 10 employees and contractors - Fee: 25,000
Annual Corporate Revenue Less Than $10 million - Fee: 37,500
Annual Corporate Revenue Less Than $50 million - Fee: 50,000
Annual Corporate Revenue Less Than $100 million - Fee: 62,500
Annual Corporate Revenue Less Than $250 million - Fee: 75,000
Annual Corporate Revenue Greater Than $250 million - Fee: 100,000
Enterprise membership is $50,000 for non-for-profit organizations, standards bodies, universities, research institutes, media and publishing, government and other organization types as defined by the Eclipse Foundation board of directors.
See the current
Enterprise Members.
Solutions Members
The Eclipse ecosystem is a vibrant community of major software vendors, small innovative software start-ups, leading information and publishing organizations, education and service providers and influential research and standards organizations. The community works to develop the complementary products, services and information, and market specific solutions that have been critical to the success of the Eclipse Platform. Being a member of this community allows organizations to benefit from the success of Eclipse.
The best way to start contributing to Eclipse is to start with well-formed bug reports and feature requests for project(s) that you are primarily interested in. Build a good reputation with the existing committers on a project. Over time, start proposing code enhancements and volunteer time to the project. Then once you have demonstrated your skills to the existing team, ask a current project committer to sponsor you as a committer. The election process is defined in each top-level project's charter.
