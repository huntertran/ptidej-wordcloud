Archived Eclipse Projects
You are seeing this because the project you were looking for has been archived. When projects are archived their data(downloads,source and website), is collected into a single tar.gz file.
Please note: Some projects did not have all of the above data.
Please note: The source files (if available) included in these files are direct copies of the available CVS/SVN data. You will need to load them into a local CVS/SVN repository to access the history.
Please note: Some of these archives are larger than 3GB
