A permanent incubator for Paho.
A permanent incubator is a project that is intended to perpetually remain in the
incubation
Permanent incubator projects never have releases; they cannot participate in the annual simultaneous release. Permanent incubators may have builds, and downloads. They conform to the standard incubation branding requirements and are subject to the IP due diligence rules outlined for incubating projects. Permanent incubators do not graduate.
