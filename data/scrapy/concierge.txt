Concierge is an
iot.eclipse.org
project
Concierge is a small-footprint implementation of the OSGi Core Specification R5 standard optimized for mobile and embedded devices.
OSGi for mobile and embedded devices
Concierge brings OSGi to your mobile and embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone black. Concierge also has support for running on Android's Dalvik VM.
Small footprint implementation
With a .jar size of around 250kb, Concierge is the smallest OSGi R5 implementation around. This results in a fast startup time and an efficient service registry. Also, the framework runs on current and upcoming Java embedded profiles (e.g. Java 8 compact profile).
OSGi R5
Concierge implements the
OSGi R5
APIs. We strictly adhere the OSGi Core specification, and omit any optional services to keep our low footprint. If needed, some extra services can be installed as separate bundles.
