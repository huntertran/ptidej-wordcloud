Scope: The scope of the Mihini project is to provide an open source implementation of an embedded runtime exposing high-level Lua API that can be used to develop portable M2M applications easily.
The Mihini project may contain server-side runtime components that can be used for testing purposes but does not aim at delivering components that can be reused directly in M2M servers.Working Group: Internet of Things (IoT)Releases:

Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and

community. Please send all feedback to the Eclipse
Proposals Forum.
Background
[Wikipedia] : Machine-to-Machine (M2M) refers to technologies that
allow both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices
of the same ability.
One big challenge when it comes to developing an embedded
application, and this is even more true for M2M development, is to
hide the complexity inherent to embedded and wireless systems.
While many M2M embedded applications are often reduced to a simple
problem consisting in collecting data on physical assets and sending
them to a server so as this data can be processed, there are many

obstacles that can seriously slow down the implementation of such
applications: constrained resources (memory, CPU, …),
communication with different kind of hardware by using specific
protocols, low-bandwidth/unreliable mobile networks, …
There are open source solutions facilitating the development of M2M
solutions but they are usually targetting embedded devices powerful
enough in terms of memory and processing power, thus offering no
viable solution for devices with more limited resources.
For this reason, the proposed Mihini project aims at delivering
an M2M Application Framework leveraging the Lua programming language

easily be used on constrained targets running Linux.
Scope
The scope of the Mihini project is to provide an open source
implementation of an embedded runtime exposing high-level Lua API that
can be used to develop portable M2M applications easily.
The Mihini project may contain server-side runtime components
that can be used for testing purposes but does not aim at delivering
components that can be reused directly in M2M servers.
Description
The goal of the Mihini project is to deliver a first-class, easy
to learn and easy to port, embedded framework for M2M development,
that integrates well with Eclipse tools.

allow to remotely control the installation and execution of
applications, independently of their language. This includes allowing
an IDE to monitor and deploy applications easily ;
Application Settings Management —
Mihini will include an API to manipulate the configuration settings
of applications developed using the Application Framework.
Mihini will be designed so as to enable first-class support by
development tools (remote debugging, application monitoring,
communications tracing, …), and in particular it will provide a
REST API giving access to core features of the framework.
Why Eclipse?
Since Mihini is providing an M2M framework, it has by nature
strong relationships with the M2M activities at Eclipse:
The API provided by the Mihini project will be defined by the
M2M Industry Working Group ;
The tools for Mihini will be developed by the Koneki

project team. In particular, Mihini will benefit from the already
existing Lua Development Tools, and it is expected that Koneki will
be enhanced with a Target Management feature that will allow easy
remote debugging and deployment of Mihini applications ;
The Paho project delivers implementations of
M2M messaging protocols. Mihini will initially use HTTP and TCP as
transport layers, and aims at being compatible with the messaging
protocols delivered by Paho.
While Mihini is focusing on delivering a Lua API, the project
team will work on providing OSGi bundles that interact with the Mihini
runtime to allow better integration between the Java and Lua virtual
machines, therefore a possible collaboration with the Equinox project
team is expected.

and Device Management ;
The specification of a protocol used to interact with an M2M server ;
A documentation explaining how to port the Mihini framework
on a Linux target.
Legal Issues
The Mihini initial contribution is based on an enhanced version of the
Lua VM which has already been approved for the Koneki project (CQ
5575). While Mihini dependencies are mostly libraries in the
public domain or in MIT licenses with pretty clear pedigree, there is
one LGPL library that might require a slight refactoring in order to
be turned into a "works-with" dependency.

The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to
the project:

The M2M IWG have made yet another project proposal – this one is set to make embedded application development infinitely easy.
Nobody can really accuse the new Machine-To-Machine (M2M)
Industry Working Group of not being productive. Yet another Eclipse
project proposal has emerged, hoping to
sit alongside messaging protocol project Paho and M2M tools project
Koneki.
Formed at the end of last year, the M2M Industry
Working Group was set up to define and implement an open standard
platform for the developing technology, bringing together and
creating M2M tools. Sierra Wireless, IBM and Eurotech were the
three founding members, and this latest contribution has come from
the minds of those at Sierra Wireless.
Falling under the

subproject, the scope of the Mihini project is to provide an open

source implementation of an embedded runtime exposing a high-level
Lua API. The long-term goal for Mihini is for the implementation to
become part of developing portable M2M applications much more
seamlessly than presently.
This is a critical component for M2M technology. Currently,
complexity is the main stumbling block when it comes to developing
embedded applications and wireless systems. The proposal details
this further saying that despite some M2M embedded applications
being reduced to a simple problem, ‘there are many obstacles that
can seriously slow down the implementation of such applications’.
Problems include constrained resources such as memory and CPU,
hardware using different protocols to communicate and unreliable
mobile networks.
Therefore, Mihini’s target seems fairly clear- to create an M2M
Applications Framework, leveraging Lua, the lightweight embeddable

language of choice for M2M, that can ease the entire process.
Aside from providing several new APIs to make sense of M2M
noise, a lot more is expected of Mihini. Proposed key management
features of the Mihini Framework will make it possible to
consolidate and send data to physical assets of an M2M component
without fearing for the network constraints, through exposing the
Lua API.
Mihini will also facilitate access to system I/Os,
provide a manipulating API to configure applications
and remotely control installation and execution of
applications no matter what language they communicate in. We can
also expect a REST API to join the dots for the rest of the M2M
world (Paho, Koneki)
Without falling foul of the approval process, which should be
a formality given how critical the proposal is to the technology,
this subproject shows great potential. A tentative schedule has

been put in place, with Sierra Wireless saying that the initial
contribution (Lua API for Device, Aseet and I/O management plus
documentation) will arrive in October. Further down the line, if
all goes well, we should see a 1.0 release in time for the next
Eclipse release train Kepler (June 2013).
We see Mihini fitting into the M2M world like a glove and
hope it gets the attention it deserves. We’ll keep you posted on
any further developments.
