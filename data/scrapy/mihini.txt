Mihini
Mihini
The Mihini project is a proposed open source incubator project under the
Eclipse Technology Project
.
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse community. Please send all feedback to the
Eclipse Proposals
Forum.
Background
One big challenge when it comes to developing an embedded application, and this is even more true for M2M development, is to hide the complexity inherent to embedded and wireless systems.
While many M2M embedded applications are often reduced to a simple problem consisting in collecting data on physical assets and sending them to a server so as this data can be processed, there are many obstacles that can seriously slow down the implementation of such applications: constrained resources (memory, CPU, …), communication with different kind of hardware by using specific protocols, low-bandwidth/unreliable mobile networks, …
There are open source solutions facilitating the development of M2M solutions but they are usually targetting embedded devices powerful enough in terms of memory and processing power, thus offering no viable solution for devices with more limited resources.
For this reason, the proposed Mihini project aims at delivering an M2M Application Framework leveraging the Lua programming language — a lightweight embeddable script language — that can easily be used on constrained targets running Linux.

Scope
The scope of the Mihini project is to provide an open source implementation of an embedded runtime exposing high-level Lua API that can be used to develop portable M2M applications easily.
The Mihini project may contain server-side runtime components that can be used for testing purposes but does not aim at delivering components that can be reused directly in M2M servers.
Description
The goal of the Mihini project is to deliver a first-class, easy to learn and easy to port, embedded framework for M2M development, that integrates well with Eclipse tools.
The Mihini Framework will expose Lua API for the following key features:
Data Management
— The Mihini Application Framework will expose API to consolidate and send data corresponding to physical assets connected to an M2M system, without having to worry about underlying network constraints ;
I/O Management
— Mihini aims at facilitating the access to system I/Os (serial port, GPIO, …) and provide a consistent API to implement protocol parsers ;
Device Management
— Mihini will propose an API to interact with the underlying system to perform low-level operations (reboot, AT commands, …) ;
Application Management
— Mihini will allow to remotely control the installation and execution of applications, independently of their language. This includes allowing an IDE to monitor and deploy applications easily ;
Application Settings Management
— Mihini will include an API to manipulate the configuration settings of applications developed using the Application Framework.
Mihini will be designed so as to enable first-class support by development tools (remote debugging, application monitoring, communications tracing, …), and in particular it will provide a REST API giving access to core features of the framework.
Mihini
is an open source incubator project under the Eclipse Technology umbrella.
The main goal of Mihini is to deliver an embedded runtime running on top of Linux, that exposes high-level API for building M2M applications. Mihini aims at enabling easy and portable development, by facilitating access to the I/Os of an M2M system, providing a communication layer, etc.

Why Eclipse?
Since Mihini is providing an M2M framework, it has by nature strong relationships with the M2M activities at Eclipse:
The API provided by the Mihini project will be defined by the
M2M Industry Working Group
;
The tools for Mihini will be developed by the
Koneki
project team. In particular, Mihini will benefit from the already existing Lua Development Tools, and it is expected that Koneki will be enhanced with a Target Management feature that will allow easy remote debugging and deployment of Mihini applications ;
The
Paho
project delivers implementations of M2M messaging protocols. Mihini will initially use HTTP and TCP as transport layers, and aims at being compatible with the messaging protocols delivered by Paho.
While Mihini is focusing on delivering a Lua API, the project team will work on providing OSGi bundles that interact with the Mihini runtime to allow better integration between the Java and Lua virtual machines, therefore a possible collaboration with the Equinox project team is expected.
Initial Contribution
The Mihini project will be seeded with an initial contribution from Sierra Wireless:

The specification of a protocol used to interact with an M2M server ;
A documentation explaining how to port the Mihini framework on a Linux target.
Legal Issues
The Mihini initial contribution is based on an enhanced version of the Lua VM which has already been approved for the Koneki project (CQ 5575).
While Mihini dependencies are mostly libraries in the public domain or in MIT licenses with pretty clear pedigree, there is one LGPL library that might require a slight refactoring in order to be turned into a "works-with" dependency.
Committers
The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:

New M2M portable project arrives at Eclipse – welcome Mihini
July 23, 2012

The M2M IWG have made yet another project proposal – this one is set to make embedded application development infinitely easy.
Nobody can really accuse the new Machine-To-Machine (M2M) Industry Working Group of not being productive. Yet another Eclipse project proposal
has emerged
, hoping to sit alongside messaging protocol project Paho and M2M tools project Koneki.
Formed at the
end of last year, the M2M Industry Working Group was set up to define and implement an open standard platform for the developing technology, bringing together and creating M2M tools. Sierra Wireless, IBM and Eurotech were the three founding members, and this latest contribution has come from the minds of those at Sierra Wireless.
Falling under the
Eclipse Technology Project
as a subproject, the scope of the Mihini project is to provide an open source implementation of an embedded runtime exposing a high-level Lua API. The long-term goal for Mihini is for the implementation to become part of developing portable M2M applications much more seamlessly than presently.
This is a critical component for M2M technology. Currently, complexity is the main stumbling block when it comes to developing embedded applications and wireless systems. The proposal details this further saying that despite some M2M embedded applications being reduced to a simple problem, ‘there are many obstacles that can seriously slow down the implementation of such applications’. Problems include constrained resources such as memory and CPU, hardware using different protocols to communicate and unreliable mobile networks.
Therefore, Mihini’s target seems fairly clear- to create an M2M Applications Framework, leveraging Lua, the lightweight embeddable language of choice for M2M, that can ease the entire process.
Aside from providing several new APIs to make sense of M2M noise, a lot more is expected of Mihini. Proposed key management features of the Mihini Framework will make it possible to consolidate and send data to physical assets of an M2M component without fearing for the network constraints, through exposing the Lua API.
Mihini will also facilitate access to system I/Os,
provide a manipulating API to configure applications
and remotely control installation and execution of applications no matter what language they communicate in. We can also expect a REST API to join the dots for the rest of the M2M world (Paho, Koneki)
Without falling foul of the approval process, which should be a formality given how critical the proposal is to the technology, this subproject shows great potential. A tentative schedule has been put in place, with Sierra Wireless saying that the initial contribution (Lua API for Device, Aseet and I/O management plus documentation) will arrive in October. Further down the line, if all goes well, we should see a 1.0 release in time for the next Eclipse release train Kepler (June 2013).
We see Mihini fitting into the M2M world like a glove and hope it gets the attention it deserves. We’ll keep you posted on any further developments.
