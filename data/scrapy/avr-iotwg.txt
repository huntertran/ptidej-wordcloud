Create Smart, Secure Nodes for Google IoT Cloud Platforms
Designing secure, cloud-connected systems does not have to be an overwhelming process. Our AVR-IoT, PIC-IoT and SAM-IoT development boards provide a perfect starting point for creating almost any IoT device, ranging from wireless sensor nodes to intelligent lighting systems. These boards offer a plug-and-play solution that combines a powerful yet simple AVR®, PIC® or SAM (Arm® Cortex®-based) microcontroller (MCU), a CryptoAuthentication™ secure element and a fully-certified Wi-Fi ® network controller module to provide an easy and effective way to connect embedded applications to Google’s Cloud IoT Core platform. These development boards are an ideal foundation for effortlessly creating cloud-connected designs. With a huge installed base of embedded applications using AVR, PIC and SAM MCUs, connecting these designs to the cloud for remote command or control just got easier.
