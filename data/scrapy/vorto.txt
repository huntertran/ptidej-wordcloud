Harmonizing specific device payloads using Eclipse Vorto
Sep 5, 2019

Alexander Edelmann
你好(Chinese for “Hello”), I am based in Singapore and have been working as a software engineer for Robert Bosch since 2006. I am passionate about IoT and believe in open standards that determine the successful interplay between devices across various IoT platforms. That is why I actively contribute to the Eclipse IoT Vorto project, which aims to provide cloud-based tools to uniformly describe IoT devices and integrate them into various IoT platforms based on open IoT standards. My IoT geeky side apart, I enjoy Asian cuisines that allow me to practice my chopsticks skills. You can also find me on the court hitting a few tennis balls with my friends.
In a technical environment without a global standard, IoT device manufacturers, integrators, and platform providers are facing difficulties keeping
up with the massive amounts of different payload formats
, APIs, and proprietary protocols.
The open source project Eclipse Vorto addresses this problem by providing cloud-based editors to abstract vendor-specific device payloads as re-usable Vorto Function Blocks. These are then aggregated to describe a whole device in the form of a Vorto Information Model. Information Models and Function Blocks are written in
vortolang
,
a simple grammar to
define interfaces between a physical device and its digital twin counterpart
.
IoT solutions communicate with physical devices only via these abstract Function Blocks and their co-related data schema. In this way, IoT solutions become de-coupled from the plethora of different device data formats, APIs, and encodings. But how to convert the device data to these abstract Function Block interfaces? Simple: with so-called Vorto Mapping Specifications, which contain all the necessary instructions in order to harmonize device-specific payloads.
Payload normalization in general
Normalization of data can be handled on different system nodes, depending on the requirements of the IoT use case. This separation allows entities to keep full control over where they transform their proprietary into normalized data.
Normalization
on a device node
In this scenario, the IoT device is a smart device, providing added services utilizing the onboard sensors. An example is a
Bosch smart oven
that provides built-in analytics on normalized data; data that could be aggregated in a cloud data lake.
Normalization
on a gateway node
Normalization
on an IoT platform node
Very much like in a gateway node, a cloud IoT platform normalizes incoming telemetry device data from various protocol adapters (MQTT, CoAP, etc) in order to provide value added services to northbound IoT solutions. Examples are device management or data analytics features.
Normalization
on an application node
An application would normalize data in order to stay agnostic of supported devices and stay more focused on the application-specific business features, rather than implementing technical, device-specific data decoders.
Sometimes a device quite simply is not capable of carrying out payload mapping. But there are also other factors that can play a role. Think about the limitations that come with sending data to the back-end via a mobile connection. Often, you want to keep the amount of data you are transmitting to a minimum. The problem is that after mapping, the device payload is more bloated due to the normalization and conversion from binary data and similar information. To save on bandwidth, it can therefore make more sense to perform payload mapping on a different system node; on the platform for instance.
When payload mapping is not performed on the device, a different entity is needed that can execute this step. You have to use a mapping engine, which enables payloads to be transformed on either an intermediary – such as a gateway – the platform, or directly in the application.

Normalization of data can be handled either on a device node (1), on a gateway node (2), on an IoT platform node (3) or on an application node (4).

As a German computer science student, I have taken on assignments in 3 different departments at Bosch over the last one and a half years. I’m particularly interested in Open Source and EduTech technologies. I believe that the IoT and automation have a huge potential to both change and improve the way people live, work, and enjoy life. A passionate learner and developer, I’m always keen to learn new skills and tooling. In addition to my regular work, I have built and now maintain the world’s largest free open-source automation bot for Instagram. In my free time, I enjoy climbing outings with friends and travel in foreign countries.
How Eclipse Vorto addresses normalization
Eclipse Vorto
offers a runtime library that can be configured via a Vorto Information Model for the device. It includes a mapping specification that enriches the Information Model with device-specific payload conversion rules. In practice, the runtime library takes the device payload as an input and then outputs the converted and normalized payload, by applying the mapping specification.
The mapping specification is managed and version controlled in the
Vorto Repository
, alongside the Information Model for the device. This makes it possible to re-use the mapping specification for other use cases, regardless of whether the normalization takes place on the device, the gateway, the platform, or the application node. The mapping library is currently supported on the Java and Node.js platform. Read more about the
Vorto Payload Mapping library
.
Example: Normalizing industry data using Eclipse Vorto
In order to clarify the concepts described earlier, we will look at a specific example of how the Vorto Information Model and the mappings are used.
In our case, we send CSV data from a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to an
Eclipse Hono
MQTT connector.
The Vorto Payload normalization middleware consumes the data from Eclipse Hono, pipes it through the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine, and exposes the normalized device data as an AMQP topic. Any AMQP 1.0 subscriber can now retrieve harmonized device data and process it regardless of the connected device using a digital twin solution such as Bosch IoT Things.
In our example, we use
Eclipse Ditto
, an open source digital twin service, that receives the normalized Eclipse Vorto data and stores it. The
Vorto Dashboard
then requests the data from the Eclipse Ditto digital twin API and renders the data nicely using pre-defined Eclipse Vorto compliant UI widgets.

If you want to see how the whole pipeline of mapping different device payloads with the Vorto Mapping Engine works, feel free to head over to the

This article only gives a brief introduction to Payload Mappings. If you want to go through the whole process of setting up this pipeline for your own use cases, you can
use our detailed tutorial
to do so. It will explain how to map your custom device payloads step by step.

I am passionate about IoT and believe in open standards that determine the successful interplay between devices across various IoT platforms. That is why I actively contribute to the Eclipse IoT Vorto project, which aims to provide cloud-based tools to uniformly describe IoT devices and integrate them into various IoT platforms based on open IoT standards. My IoT geeky side apart, I enjoy Asian cuisines that allow me to practice my chopsticks skills. You can also find me on the court hitting a few tennis balls with my friends.
Looking at examples like smart factories and homes, connected devices are improving not only the cost and resource efficiency of companies but are also increasing the safety and convenience of living. With the sheer number of device and sensor manufacturers,
new challenges are surfacing
for the manufacturers, platforms, and integrators.
The main problem is how to ensure connected devices can
seamlessly communicate
with cloud platforms, regardless of the
different manufacturers, technologies, and systems
. In the past, developers have built IoT solutions that were specifically designed for a limited set of devices that had the same API. When changing the device type or switching device manufacturers the device integration required time-consuming refactoring to work with the new device.
Imagine you plan to integrate an IoT solution for asset tracking on a large crop farm. You not only want to keep track of the current location but also temperature and acceleration of the tractors, plows, and other agricultural devices.
Two questions surface when thinking about choosing the right IoT devices:
How can we avoid
tight coupling
between specific devices so it is easier to switch to a similar device without too much refactoring?
This is where the open source
Eclipse Vorto
steps in.
Introducing Eclipse Vorto
Source: Eclipse Vorto
The Eclipse Vorto project is built on four main components:
Vorto DSL:
The Vorto DSL is a readable and easily understood domain-specific language that was specifically designed to be usable even by non-developers. It is used to create the abstract models of different devices.
Metamodel:
The metamodel is used to define the relationship between the different entities like Information Models, Function Blocks, and Datatypes.
Code Generators:
Based on the DSL and metamodels, the code generators provide a sophisticated but simple way to create source code for a convenient integration of the defined IoT devices with an IoT solution platform.
Vorto Repository:
The repository is used to store, manage, and distribute the created Information Models and Function Blocks for re-use.
Eclipse Vorto is fully open source
and developed within the Eclipse IoT Working Group under the stewardship of Bosch.

Eclipse Vorto in practice
Let’s look at a more specific example to understand this abstraction better. Imagine an agriculture business that wants to keep track of the vehicles and assets used to collect the wheat crops. On larger farms with several harvesters, tractors, and other assets, we want to know the amount of time each vehicle was used and its location history.
When combining this kind of information with temperature and humidity values, we can enable a smart maintenance plan for all the vehicles and assets. The location of each vehicle and asset also provides us with anti-theft capabilities.
Source: Bosch.IO
In order to create a digital model of this specific device, we need to have some basic building blocks which will be used to assemble the TRACI Information Model.
One of the most important components of the tracking device is the battery. To be able to monitor the battery state of each device we can describe the state in what is called, a Function Block.
A Function Block is a generic model that can be reused later on in other device Information Models.
We can define one like this:
Here we describe a
Function Block
that abstractly describes some entity that contains a mandatory numerical value between 0 and 100.
Since our status is a percentage value, we can further abstract this to, again, make the distinct components reusable. Therefore, we will create what is called a
Datatype
. Here we can define an entity (
Percentage
in this case) that has the same restrictions of being a numerical value between 0 and 100.
Once we created this Datatype, it can be imported and used inside our
Battery Function Block
and replaces the concrete implementation.
We can repeat this process for all the sensors integrated into our
TRACI
device like the
temperature sensor
,
GPS
,
acceleration
, and
connectivity modules
. All those Function Blocks can then be assembled in a
Vorto Information Model
which can then be used as the starting point for the code generators to produce device integration code stubs for you.
Alright, so what do we do all this for?
Let’s say we now want to use devices from other manufacturers with similar features to the TRACI device. We’ve already created an IoT solution that integrated the TRACI device and it would be a huge pain to refactor our system to work with devices from different manufacturers.
Since we already have our Function Blocks and the Datatypes defined, we can define a new
Information Model for our new device
that uses the same Function Blocks as the TRACI model.

.
We can see that even the connectivity modules are different in this model but are still using the abstract Connectivity Function Block. The abstraction allows us to
Who should use Eclipse Vorto?
Given the diversity of entities involved in manufacturing, integration, and development of IoT solutions, the entities that will benefit most from Eclipse Vorto are:
Device manufacturers
Eclipse Vorto can help device manufacturers enable interoperability with other devices in existing infrastructures. Flexibility is a huge advantage to customers when choosing devices that are to be integrated.
By using technology independent Information Models, device manufacturers avoid the overhead of generating ways of implementations for all kind of target platforms. This saves money and time by publishing Information Models that can be converted into concrete integrations using the code generators.
The big advantage of using Eclipse Vorto is that further evolutions of the device protocol layer are decoupled from the device controller logic.

IoT platforms
IoT platforms have to connect a vast variety of different IoT devices from a wide range of manufacturers and support all the different protocols and formats. By using Eclipse Vorto’s code generators, this effort can be reduced drastically through either partial or full source code generation.
In addition, the Vorto Repository acts as a runtime repository which allows platforms to retrieve device capabilities as JSON schema. These schemas can then be interpreted and validated in the digital twin or used to bootstrap connectors for the communication.
Even though this means increased initial development work, it will pay off over time considering the vast amount of devices and the growth of IoT.
Solution developers
When integrating connected devices and smart sensors into IoT solutions, developers need to cover a wide range of different device APIs which results in a huge coding overhead. Eclipse Vorto can reduce the amount of development work involved by providing code generators that provide generic code stubs that simplify the integration of devices.

Glancing into the future of the IoT
By guaranteeing interoperability and harmonizing the interface for devices,
Eclipse Vorto
has the potential to change the way device manufacturers, IoT platform operators and application developers work with IoT devices.
It can reduce the development work for manufacturers and ease the device integration for platform providers and integrators while tackling many of the mentioned challenges of IoT development.
