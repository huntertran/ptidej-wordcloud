The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

Vorto Repository - Manages standardized IoT device
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Hello Vorto peopleI've created a Vorto infomodel and used the Ditto export plugin feature.Are there any docs how to import these .json files into Ditto?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?

Eclipse Vorto: The next step in IoT device integration
6 min
Alexander Edelmann
你好(Chinese for “Hello”), I am based in Singapore and have been working as a software engineer for Robert Bosch since 2006. I am passionate about IoT and believe in open standards that determine the successful interplay between devices across various IoT platforms. That is why I actively contribute to the Eclipse IoT Vorto project, which aims to provide cloud-based tools to uniformly describe IoT devices and integrate them into various IoT platforms based on open IoT standards. My IoT geeky side apart, I enjoy Asian cuisines that allow me to practice my chopsticks skills. You can also find me on the court hitting a few tennis balls with my friends.
Looking at examples like smart factories and homes, connected devices are improving not only the cost and resource efficiency of companies but are also increasing the safety and convenience of living. With the sheer number of device and sensor manufacturers, new challenges are surfacing for the manufacturers, platforms, and integrators.
The main problem is how to ensure connected devices can seamlessly communicate with cloud platforms, regardless of the different manufacturers, technologies, and systems. In the past, developers have built IoT solutions that were specifically designed for a limited set of devices that had the same API. When changing the device type or switching device manufacturers the device integration required time-consuming refactoring to work with the new device.
Imagine you plan to integrate an IoT solution for asset tracking on a large crop farm. You not only want to keep track of the current location but also temperature and acceleration of the tractors, plows, and other agricultural devices.

then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto
Two questions surface when thinking about choosing the right IoT devices:
How can we avoid tight coupling between specific devices so it is easier to switch to a similar device without too much refactoring?
This is where the open source Eclipse Vorto steps in.
Introducing Eclipse Vorto
Source: Eclipse Vorto
The Eclipse Vorto project is built on four main components:
Vorto DSL: The Vorto DSL is a readable and easily understood domain-specific language that was specifically designed to be usable even by non-developers. It is used to create the abstract models of different devices.
Metamodel: The metamodel is used to define the relationship between the different entities like Information Models, Function Blocks, and Datatypes.
Code Generators: Based on the DSL and metamodels, the code generators provide a sophisticated but simple way to create source code for a convenient integration of the defined IoT devices with an IoT solution platform.
Vorto Repository: The repository is used to store, manage, and distribute the created Information Models and Function Blocks for re-use.
Eclipse Vorto is fully open source and developed within the Eclipse IoT Working Group under the stewardship of Bosch.
Tim Grossmann
As a German computer science student, I have taken on assignments in 3 different departments at Bosch over the last one and a half years. I’m particularly interested in Open Source and EduTech technologies. I believe that the IoT and automation have a huge potential to both change and improve the way people live, work, and enjoy life. A passionate learner and developer, I’m always keen to learn new skills and tooling. In addition to my regular work, I have built and now maintain the world’s largest free open-source automation bot for Instagram. In my free time, I enjoy climbing outings with friends and travel in foreign countries.

@kolotu I found out: I am using a VPN for access, which reduces strongly my internet speed. It seems that it is timing out (works perfectly if I unplug the VPN). Is there any way for me to change the timeout period?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

Eclipse Vorto in practice
Let’s look at a more specific example to understand this abstraction better. Imagine an agriculture business that wants to keep track of the vehicles and assets used to collect the wheat crops. On larger farms with several harvesters, tractors, and other assets, we want to know the amount of time each vehicle was used and its location history.
When combining this kind of information with temperature and humidity values, we can enable a smart maintenance plan for all the vehicles and assets. The location of each vehicle and asset also provides us with anti-theft capabilities.
Source: Bosch.IO
In order to create a digital model of this specific device, we need to have some basic building blocks which will be used to assemble the TRACI Information Model.
One of the most important components of the tracking device is the battery. To be able to monitor the battery state of each device we can describe the state in what is called, a Function Block.
A Function Block is a generic model that can be reused later on in other device Information Models.
We can define one like this:
namespace org.eclipse.vorto
version 1.0.0
displayname "Battery"
description "Functionblock for Battery"
category peripheral
using org.eclipse.vorto.Voltage ; 1.0.0

Ok, thanks a lot!

@tobias-zeptio
Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

this would translate to the following ditto model:"features": {

Hi @oscarfh yes the documentation is still up to date - I just tried it and was not able to reproduce your issue. Could you please double check your configuration - especially your Github client ID and client secret?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
Hi @kolotu, thanks for your reply.
I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet
# Repository
DATASOURCE=mysql
AUTH_PROVIDER=github
ADMIN_USER=oscarfh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
EIDP_CLIENT_ID=
EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
status {
mandatory remainingCapacity as float <MIN 0, MAX 100>
}
}
Here we describe a Function Block that abstractly describes some entity that contains a mandatory numerical value between 0 and 100.
Since our status is a percentage value, we can further abstract this to, again, make the distinct components reusable. Therefore, we will create what is called a Datatype. Here we can define an entity (Percentage in this case) that has the same restrictions of being a numerical value between 0 and 100.
namespace org.eclipse.vorto.types
version 1.0.0
displayname "Percentage"
description "Datatype for Percentage"
category units
entity Percentage {
mandatory value as float <MIN 0, MAX 100>
}
Once we created this Datatype, it can be imported and used inside our Battery Function Block and replaces the concrete implementation.

the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml

category peripheral
using org.eclipse.vorto.types.Percentage ; 1.0.0
using org.eclipse.vorto.Voltage ; 1.0.0
status {

}
}
We can repeat this process for all the sensors integrated into our TRACI device like the temperature sensor, GPS, acceleration, and connectivity modules. All those Function Blocks can then be assembled in a Vorto Information Model which can then be used as the starting point for the code generators to produce device integration code stubs for you.

Hey @demetz Yes the usage of multiple within a Functionblock with a Datatype is valid. The translation into Ditto would be a bit different however - instead of Gateway_id1, Gateway_id2, ... the proper translation would be using an array, but the logic you applied is indeed valid. It should look like this: "features": {
"lorawan" : {
"definition": ["othermo:LoRaWAN:1.1.0"],
"properties": {
"status": {
"devEUI" : "",
"gateway" : [{
"gatewayId" : "id1",

I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Ok … then that would make things easier
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
you can use our mail template to request the official namespace - you can find it on the 'Manage' tab on the UI

I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

Alright, so what do we do all this for?
Let’s say we now want to use devices from other manufacturers with similar features to the TRACI device. We’ve already created an IoT solution that integrated the TRACI device and it would be a huge pain to refactor our system to work with devices from different manufacturers.
Since we already have our Function Blocks and the Datatypes defined, we can define a new Information Model for our new device that uses the same Function Blocks as the TRACI model.

EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

Generate a Node.js Dashboard that reads device data from Bosch IoT Suite and visualizes it in Vorto UI Widgets.
This tutorial teaches you how to use the Vorto Dashboard and quickly display the data of the integrated things.
we will use our RaspberryPi Information Model that is already released and available for you to use.
Once set up, the dashboard displays the latest state of your things in a visually appealing manner.
Prerequisites
NodeJS and NPM installed
Created a Bosch ID User Account
Created a Thing from an Information Model (refer to Creating a thing)
Steps
Download and install the Vorto Dashboard
Create a config.json file with the Client ID, Client secret, scope from your OAuth2 Client
Create more Things
Download and install the Vorto Dashboard
1. Download and install the Vorto Dashboard by using NPM. In your Terminal type npm install -g vorto-dashboard.
This will install the dashboard as a global dependency which will allow you to call it as vorto-dashboard from the Terminal.
Create a config.json file with the Client ID, Client secret, scope from your OAuth2 Client

Harmonizing specific device payloads using Eclipse Vorto
4 min
Alexander Edelmann
你好(Chinese for “Hello”), I am based in Singapore and have been working as a software engineer for Robert Bosch since 2006. I am passionate about IoT and believe in open standards that determine the successful interplay between devices across various IoT platforms. That is why I actively contribute to the Eclipse IoT Vorto project, which aims to provide cloud-based tools to uniformly describe IoT devices and integrate them into various IoT platforms based on open IoT standards. My IoT geeky side apart, I enjoy Asian cuisines that allow me to practice my chopsticks skills. You can also find me on the court hitting a few tennis balls with my friends.
In a technical environment without a global standard, IoT device manufacturers, integrators, and platform providers are facing difficulties keeping up with the massive amounts of different payload formats, APIs, and proprietary protocols.
The open source project Eclipse Vorto addresses this problem by providing cloud-based editors to abstract vendor-specific device payloads as re-usable Vorto Function Blocks. These are then aggregated to describe a whole device in the form of a Vorto Information Model. Information Models and Function Blocks are written in vortolang, a simple grammar to define interfaces between a physical device and its digital twin counterpart. IoT solutions communicate with physical devices only via these abstract Function Blocks and their co-related data schema. In this way, IoT solutions become de-coupled from the plethora of different device data formats, APIs, and encodings. But how to convert the device data to these abstract Function Block interfaces? Simple: with so-called Vorto Mapping Specifications, which contain all the necessary instructions in order to harmonize device-specific payloads.
Payload normalization in general
Normalization of data can be handled on different system nodes, depending on the requirements of the IoT use case. This separation allows entities to keep full control over where they transform their proprietary into normalized data.
Normalization on a device node
In this scenario, the IoT device is a smart device, providing added services utilizing the onboard sensors. An example is a Bosch smart oven that provides built-in analytics on normalized data; data that could be aggregated in a cloud data lake.

ok, thanks. the downside with using an array is that it is very hard to query / write the data:somethimes, I might have 3 gateways picking up the signal from a sensor. at other times the signal from the same device is being picked up by only 1 gateway.

Hello Vorto peopleI've created a Vorto infomodel and used the Ditto export plugin feature.Are there any docs how to import these .json files into Ditto?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?
infomodel NLAT2VS {
battery as Battery
acceleration as Acceleration
location as Geolocation
temperature as Temperature
humidity as Humidity
wifiConnectivity as Connectivity
cellularConnectivity as Connectivity
}
}
Who should use Eclipse Vorto?
Given the diversity of entities involved in manufacturing, integration, and development of IoT solutions, the entities that will benefit most from Eclipse Vorto are:
Device manufacturers
Eclipse Vorto can help device manufacturers enable interoperability with other devices in existing infrastructures. Flexibility is a huge advantage to customers when choosing devices that are to be integrated.
By using technology independent Information Models, device manufacturers avoid the overhead of generating ways of implementations for all kind of target platforms. This saves money and time by publishing Information Models that can be converted into concrete integrations using the code generators.

@demetz maybe you could use a dictionary ( https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/master/docs/vortolang-1.0.md#dictionary ) insteaddictionary[string, Gateway]the Ditto JSON Schema Generator however doesn't support dicitionaries yet, if I remember correctly
but mapping to JSON of a Vorto dictionary should be a plain JSON Object, e.g.:{
"id1": {
"uplinkId":"",
"signalStrength":0.0,
"signalNoiseRatio":0.0
},
"id2": {
"uplinkId":"",
"signalStrength":0.0,
"signalNoiseRatio":0.0
}
}

@thjaeckle thanks. this approach is also be very useful for mapping PLC's, where you have 1...n inputs of different kinds (e.g. 8x digital inputs, 8x analog inputs, 24x PT1000)...

Describing a device with Vorto in 5 minutes
This tutorial explains how to describe a device with Vorto in just a few minutes. The device we are going to create will have the following capabilities:
Measuring the Outdoor temperature
Measuring the Indoor temperature
Reading the Geo Location of these measurements.
Let's get started.
Prerequisite
BoschID Account or GitHub
You are a collaborator/owner of an existing namespace
Steps to follow
Log in to Vorto Repository with your BoschID or Github Account
Select Create model
Choose Information Model and confirm with Next
2. While the dependencies are being installed, create the config.json file and insert client_id, secret and scope from your Already created OAuth2 Client.
The content of the file has to look like this:
{
"client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
"client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
"scope": "<YOUR_SCOPE>",
"intervalMS": 10000
}
Note: Make sure to use the Things scope in your config.json file!
Start the dashboard
3. Once the dashboard is installed and you've created the config.json file, do a simple vorto-dashboard <PATH_TO_CONFIG.JSON> like e.g. vorto-dashboard ./config.json if it is in your current directory.
4. If everything is running correctly, you will see something like this in your Terminal:
App running on port 8080
=> Successfully pulled 5 things.
Open localhost:8080 this URL in your browser.
5. You will now be able to see your things inside of the Vorto Dashboard.
If your device isn't integrated and sending data already, check out these tutorials on how to start sending device data to the cloud.
Normalization on an IoT platform node
Very much like in a gateway node, a cloud IoT platform normalizes incoming telemetry device data from various protocol adapters (MQTT, CoAP, etc) in order to provide value added services to northbound IoT solutions. Examples are device management or data analytics features.
Normalization on an application node
An application would normalize data in order to stay agnostic of supported devices and stay more focused on the application-specific business features, rather than implementing technical, device-specific data decoders.
Sometimes a device quite simply is not capable of carrying out payload mapping. But there are also other factors that can play a role. Think about the limitations that come with sending data to the back-end via a mobile connection. Often, you want to keep the amount of data you are transmitting to a minimum. The problem is that after mapping, the device payload is more bloated due to the normalization and conversion from binary data and similar information. To save on bandwidth, it can therefore make more sense to perform payload mapping on a different system node; on the platform for instance.
When payload mapping is not performed on the device, a different entity is needed that can execute this step. You have to use a mapping engine, which enables payloads to be transformed on either an intermediary – such as a gateway – the platform, or directly in the application.
Source: Eclipse Vorto
Normalization of data can be handled either on a device node (1), on a gateway node (2), on an IoT platform node (3) or on an application node (4).

As a German computer science student, I have taken on assignments in 3 different departments at Bosch over the last one and a half years. I’m particularly interested in Open Source and EduTech technologies. I believe that the IoT and automation have a huge potential to both change and improve the way people live, work, and enjoy life. A passionate learner and developer, I’m always keen to learn new skills and tooling. In addition to my regular work, I have built and now maintain the world’s largest free open-source automation bot for Instagram. In my free time, I enjoy climbing outings with friends and travel in foreign countries.
How Eclipse Vorto addresses normalization
Eclipse Vorto offers a runtime library that can be configured via a Vorto Information Model for the device. It includes a mapping specification that enriches the Information Model with device-specific payload conversion rules. In practice, the runtime library takes the device payload as an input and then outputs the converted and normalized payload, by applying the mapping specification.
The mapping specification is managed and version controlled in the Vorto Repository, alongside the Information Model for the device. This makes it possible to re-use the mapping specification for other use cases, regardless of whether the normalization takes place on the device, the gateway, the platform, or the application node. The mapping library is currently supported on the Java and Node.js platform. Read more about the Vorto Payload Mapping library.
Example: Normalizing industry data using Eclipse Vorto
In order to clarify the concepts described earlier, we will look at a specific example of how the Vorto Information Model and the mappings are used.

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu

Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

The big advantage of using Eclipse Vorto is that further evolutions of the device protocol layer are decoupled from the device controller logic.

IoT platforms
IoT platforms have to connect a vast variety of different IoT devices from a wide range of manufacturers and support all the different protocols and formats. By using Eclipse Vorto’s code generators, this effort can be reduced drastically through either partial or full source code generation.
In addition, the Vorto Repository acts as a runtime repository which allows platforms to retrieve device capabilities as JSON schema. These schemas can then be interpreted and validated in the digital twin or used to bootstrap connectors for the communication.
Even though this means increased initial development work, it will pay off over time considering the vast amount of devices and the growth of IoT.
Solution developers
When integrating connected devices and smart sensors into IoT solutions, developers need to cover a wide range of different device APIs which results in a huge coding overhead. Eclipse Vorto can reduce the amount of development work involved by providing code generators that provide generic code stubs that simplify the integration of devices.
Source: Eclipse Vorto
Glancing into the future of the IoT
By guaranteeing interoperability and harmonizing the interface for devices, Eclipse Vorto has the potential to change the way device manufacturers, IoT platform operators and application developers work with IoT devices.
It can reduce the development work for manufacturers and ease the device integration for platform providers and integrators while tackling many of the mentioned challenges of IoT development.
If you want to learn more about the project, make sure to check out the GitHub repository and give it a star.
You can also give it a try and use the sophisticated tutorials for device creation, integration, and visualization provided in the Vorto Repository.

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

Hi @nebupulickal this looks to me as if the authentication fails due to an erroneous request, I would expect that an API change in the Bosch IoT Suite Authentication is the root cause for this, since we haven't changed the code of the dashboard in a while. I have opened an issue to analyse and fix the problem eclipse/vorto#2565

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I have pre-configured the image accordingly now in this PR: eclipse/vorto#2668I'll merge it later or tomorrow

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Specify the model ID and confirm with Next
Select the namespace from the dropdown
Input the name, e.g. MyWeatherStation
Input the version, e.g. 1.0.0
Choose Vorto abstraction, that provide you with a list of abstracted capabilities.
Select Temperature from the drop-down list, specify the property name indoorTemperature and confirm with Add
Select Temperature from the drop-down list, specify the property name outdoorTemperature and confirm with Add
Select Location from the drop-down list, specify the property name location and confirm with Add
Verify your selected properties and click Create. This creates the model and opens its details page:
Your model should look like this:
vortolang 1.0
namespace org.mycompany
version 1.0.0
displayname "MyWeatherStation"
Not displaying any data?
Reset the Bridge (Connection of the Asset Communication Package)
Switch back to the tutorial about integrating a device and double check that data is being sent.
If you see the sensor data being sent as shown in the Publish Payload:... but you still can't see any changes in the Dashboard or SwaggerUI API when retrieving the current state of the Thing, the connection between Hub and Things might have corrupted at some point.
This is simple to solve. This so called "Bridge" is created by default one subscribing to the Asset Communication.
Head over to your Subscriptions page and click on the Go to Dashboard button of your Asset Communication Subscription.
On the newly opened tab, click on the Connection tab that will display all the connections you've set up.
By default there will be a Telemetry Bosch IoT Hub connection.
Note that if there is a problem, you will see a triangle with an exclamation mark inside that indicates some failed connection.
Click on the connection and hit the Close connection button. Wait until the connection is closed.
Once the connection was closed, re-open it by clicking the Open connection button.
After the connection has been re-established, restart your sensor data sending script and observe.
What's next?
In our case, we send CSV data from a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to an Eclipse Hono MQTT connector.
The Vorto Payload normalization middleware consumes the data from Eclipse Hono, pipes it through the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine, and exposes the normalized device data as an AMQP topic. Any AMQP 1.0 subscriber can now retrieve harmonized device data and process it regardless of the connected device using a digital twin solution such as Bosch IoT Things.
In our example, we use Eclipse Ditto, an open source digital twin service, that receives the normalized Eclipse Vorto data and stores it. The Vorto Dashboard then requests the data from the Eclipse Ditto digital twin API and renders the data nicely using pre-defined Eclipse Vorto compliant UI widgets.
Source: Eclipse Vorto
The full conceptual setup of our device payload mapping pipeline.
If you want to see how the whole pipeline of mapping different device payloads with the Vorto Mapping Engine works, feel free to head over to the Vorto Dashboard Demo.
This article only gives a brief introduction to Payload Mappings. If you want to go through the whole process of setting up this pipeline for your own use cases, you can use our detailed tutorial to do so. It will explain how to map your custom device payloads step by step.

It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

Hey @demetz Yes the usage of multiple within a Functionblock with a Datatype is valid. The translation into Ditto would be a bit different however - instead of Gateway_id1, Gateway_id2, ... the proper translation would be using an array, but the logic you applied is indeed valid. It should look like this: "features": {
"lorawan" : {
"definition": ["othermo:LoRaWAN:1.1.0"],

Hello Vorto peopleI've created a Vorto infomodel and used the Ditto export plugin feature.Are there any docs how to import these .json files into Ditto?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Ok … then that would make things easier
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
you can use our mail template to request the official namespace - you can find it on the 'Manage' tab on the UI

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml
vorto/repository/repository-server/src/main/resources/vorto-repository-config-mysql.json
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB

Eclipse Hono 1.0.0 released: An open IoT connectivity platform
A closer look at some of the key features.
Kai Hudalla
3 min
When working in an IoT environment we have to ensure connected devices can seamlessly communicate with cloud platforms, regardless of the different manufacturer, technologies, and systems.
In the past, developers have built IoT solutions that were specifically designed for a limited set of devices that had the same API. When changing the device type or switching device manufacturers the device integration required time-consuming refactoring to work with the new device.
Vortolang 1.0 Specification
Concepts
The Vorto project is built on four main components:
Vorto Language (DSL):
The Vorto language is a readable and easily understood domain-specific language that was specifically designed to be usable even by non-developers. It is used to create the abstract models of different devices. Read more
Metamodel:
The metamodel is used to define the relationship between the different entities like Information Models, Function Blocks, and Datatypes.
Code Generators:
Based on the DSL and metamodels, the code generators provide a sophisticated but simple way to create source code for a convenient integration of the defined IoT devices with an IoT solution platform.

Hello Vorto peopleI've created a Vorto infomodel and used the Ditto export plugin feature.Are there any docs how to import these .json files into Ditto?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?
Michael van Niekerk

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok thanks @kolotu .

Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

ok, thanks. the downside with using an array is that it is very hard to query / write the data:somethimes, I might have 3 gateways picking up the signal from a sensor. at other times the signal from the same device is being picked up by only 1 gateway.

It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

Hey @demetz Yes the usage of multiple within a Functionblock with a Datatype is valid. The translation into Ditto would be a bit different however - instead of Gateway_id1, Gateway_id2, ... the proper translation would be using an array, but the logic you applied is indeed valid. It should look like this: "features": {
"lorawan" : {
"definition": ["othermo:LoRaWAN:1.1.0"],
"properties": {
"status": {
"devEUI" : "",
"gateway" : [{
"gatewayId" : "id1",
"uplinkId" : "",
"signalStrength" : 0.0,
@tobias-zeptio
Thanks, that works. :)
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication

I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something

The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

Import very slow for zip archives containing 50+ models #1997
Creator and ModifiedBy user ID not anonymized correctly, when user account is deleted #1976
Inheritance not resolved completely during Code Generation #1954
0.12
This version primarily focuses on stability, performance as well as UX.
New Features
Vorto Repository Features
Content - Assist / Auto-completion in Web Editors when writing vortolang models
Backup & Restore of all models per namespace
REST API Endpoint to allow the import of Vorto Models (or 3rd party models) in the Repository
Device Integration Features
Support for nested entities inside Function Blocks in the Payload Mapping Engine (Java only). Please take note of the compatibility section.
Supported Payload Mapping Target Platform format: AWS IoT Shadow and Eclipse Ditto Protocol
Support of operation return types in OpenAPI Generator
Compatibility
With this release, the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine now supports the mapping to nested entities, declared in Function Blocks. This change required us to completely modify the Mapping Specification JSON runtime model, which is required by the Mapping Engine at configuration time. The old mapping specification runtime-model is no longer supported. Therefore, make sure to download the new Mapping Specification from the Vorto Repository and deploy it in your system, if you upgrade to this new version! This change does not break any previous design time mapping models!

ok, thanks. the downside with using an array is that it is very hard to query / write the data:somethimes, I might have 3 gateways picking up the signal from a sensor. at other times the signal from the same device is being picked up by only 1 gateway.

Hi @kolotu, thanks for your reply.
I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet
# Repository
DATASOURCE=mysql
AUTH_PROVIDER=github
ADMIN_USER=oscarfh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
EIDP_CLIENT_ID=
EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?

@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?

I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

@demetz maybe you could use a dictionary ( https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/master/docs/vortolang-1.0.md#dictionary ) insteaddictionary[string, Gateway]the Ditto JSON Schema Generator however doesn't support dicitionaries yet, if I remember correctly
but mapping to JSON of a Vorto dictionary should be a plain JSON Object, e.g.:{
"id1": {
"uplinkId":"",
"signalStrength":0.0,
"signalNoiseRatio":0.0
},

Kevin Olotu

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

Minor Improvements
Generators generating a single file return file instead of ZIP archive
UX improvements in all modal dialogs of repository
0.11
With the release of Eclipse Vorto 0.11, we are introducing essential improvements that guarantee you full control over your models and their release process.
Fine-grained Role Management allows your team to restrict access to certain features like the creation of models, releasing it to the public, and deprecating them.
Models, by default, are created in private namespaces for which the access can be controlled in detail using the newly introduced roles.
In addition to the new, state-of-the-art, Eclipse Vorto Repository, we released the official 1.0 version of the Vortolang, the DSL powering the Vorto Ecosystem.
Due to these substantial changes, we've decided that automatically migrating all existing models to the new system is the improper approach and therefore provided straight-forward exporters and importers that will allow you to effortlessly migrate your models of choice from the old system.
Enhancements in all areas are complemented with new and extensive documentation for not only new features and improvements but also convenient plugins that have easily been missed in the past.
All in all, this release addresses, tackles, and simplifies many key pain points for people working with and in IoT and delivers some of the most important improvements to Eclipse Vorto ever.
Follow our comprehensive guide on how to migrate your models to the new system.
New Features
Please refer to our Getting started guide for details.

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

Currently reserved words like "status" or "fault" cannot be part of a namespace name.
It needs to be decided whether to allow the usage or it must be prominently documented that this is not permitted (similar to #2382).
Error messages must be displayed in case the user enters an invalid namespace name (see also #2394).

Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok thanks @kolotu .

If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

Merge pull request #2403 from bosch-io/bug/2317_license_check
…
I would strongly suggest to allow fault, as it has a specific semantic meaning and should not be replace with something like error or failure. Remember: a defect can lead to a fault which can cause a failure - all three very distinct things.

Allowing as many keywords in namespaces as possible by the grammar.
'fault', 'status', 'events', 'operations', 'breakable', 'category', 'configuration', 'description' will be allowed.

Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?

Cloud-based Vorto DSL Editors to create Vorto Models directly in the Repository
Release & Review Workflows for Vorto Models
Model Attachments, that allows users to add/remove attachments for models, like additional documentation
Various UX Improvements
Many stabilization and performance fixes
Click here to try out the Eclipse Vorto Repository with all its new features.
Device Integration Features
Payload Mapping Engine (Java-based) that executes Vorto Mapping Models in order to map device telemetry data to abstract Vorto Function Blocks.
Mapping Engine support for Eclipse Ditto protocol, to automatically convert Vorto compliant data to Eclipse Ditto data structures.
Payload Mapping Specification Editor UI, that allows device manufacturers to create mapping specifications for mapping arbitrary device payload to abstract, semantic Vorto Models
Code Generators supporting Arduino, Python and Java - based devices, generating code to send telemetry data to Eclipse Hono and Eclipse Ditto based platforms via Eclipse Paho MQTT
Developer SDK Features
Generator Plugin SDK, which allows to build and deploy Vorto Generator-plugins as standalone (micro)services and hook them into the Vorto repository.
Deprecation
The Eclipse Vorto IoT Toolset Plugins are no longer supported. Instead you can simply use the Cloud-based Editors in the Vorto Repository.
Changes in the Java Repository Client: The client has a new simplified org.eclipse.vorto.repository.client.IRepositoryClient in order to read Vorto Models.

The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?

I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu

I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?

@oscarfh
I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

Fixes and Enhancements
EU-GDPR Compliance of Vorto Repository, i.e. Export of user-specific Vorto models.
Eclipse Hono Generator, supporting the generation of Arduino-, Python- and Java source code.
Code Generator Configuration UI. Code Generators that are executed from the Eclipse Vorto Toolset do now provide a configuration UI that allows developers to customize the execution of the generator.
API Changes
Vorto Code Generators must now implement org.eclipse.vorto.codegen.api.IVortoCodeGenerator.getInfo() that give more meta information about the specific Code Generator. This information is used by Vorto to provide a Generator Configuration UI automatically.
The Vorto Repository REST - API for publishing models is now secured exclusively with OAuth2 token - based authentication.

I have come across a number of resources without copyright headers, and it can be error-prone to modify the year when working on the code.
Ideally we would have a job running on CI that verifies the following for each resource in a change set:
Standard header present at beginning of resource
Copyright years contain current year (so either Copyright (c) 2020 or Copyright (c) 2018, 2020 etc.)
Recommend @t-gauss for this one since he probably has both more knowledge of and access to our CI infrastructure.

Information Model Repository
Generator API
Vorto Code Generators convert an Information Model into executable IoT platform specific source code. The Generator API lets you plug in your own code generator into the toolset. Toolset wizards help you through this process.
Code Generators
In order to inspire you to build you own generator for your platform, we implemented many Code Generators, for example Bosch IoT Things, AWS, ThingWorx and many more. They illustrate the many possibilities of how code generators can be effectively used and act as a blueprint for other generator implementations.
Command Line Interface (CLI)
A Command Line Interface Tool lets you explore information models, checkin new information models as well as generate code for a selected IoT platform.

Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Ok … then that would make things easier
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
you can use our mail template to request the official namespace - you can find it on the 'Manage' tab on the UI

IMO it would be even better to use the Maven License Plugin. This plugin can fail your local build, in case the license headers are not correct. The plugin was already integrated, but the configuration was incorrect, therefore it was never executed.

Readme.md
Eclipse Vorto provides a language for describing models and interfaces for IoT Digital Twins. Digital twins are models of entities in the physical world such as a (multi) sensor device, smart power plant, and other entities that participate in IoT solutions. Modeling enables IoT solutions and IoT platforms to provision, use, and configure IoT devices and logical entities from multiple sources in a single solution. Using the vortolang and describing the entities's capabilities, IoT platforms and IoT solutions can leverage the semantics of these IoT entities.
Vortolang 1.0 Specification

add "eclipse-vorto" tag parametrization to all "ask a question" links in .md documentation
Edge case:
the "eclipse-vorto" tag has already been created in Stack Overflow. In the unlikely case that it was deleted, the links would still lead to a form containing the tag, but users with less than 1500+ reputation would not be able to post the form unless they remove the tag.

Getting started with Vorto Mappings
Vorto abstracts device data using Function Blocks, thus helping to reduce tight-coupling of devices in IoT solutions.
But how does Vorto help to map the actual device data to these abstract Function Blocks?
Payloads sent in different formats from the devices can be piped through the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine which will use the Mapping Specification and the provided Converters.
The advantage of using this approach is that target platforms do not have to care about the different payloads of the devices but only need to handle the normalized Vorto compliant payloads.
This normalized format can then be used as a harmonized starting point for more specific, target platform compliant formats.
In addition to that, custom Converters can be easily plugged into the Payload Mapping Engine in order to allow for more complex conversion of proprietary payloads.

In this tutorial, we are going to walk you through the process of creating a Vorto mapping specification for an Information Model and execute it with the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine.
Prerequisite
To work through this tutorial, you will need:
BoschID or GitHub account to log in to the Vorto Repository
You have described a device as a Vorto Information Model and it is managed in the Vorto Repository
You are a collaborator/owner of a namespace
Step 1: Create Mapping Specification
A mapping adds platform specific information to an Information Model. Since the representation of data can vary from platform to platform.
To create a mapping go to your newly created model and press the Create Mapping Spec. Button
Once you have written your xpath expressions, press Save.
Step 2: Test the Mapping Specification
On the right handside, select "JSON' as content type and paste the device raw data in the JSON editor. Test your mapping rule by clicking Test Mapping:
The test result will give you the mapped data for different IoT platforms.
The Vorto (canonical) format looks like:
The AWS IoT Shadow update command format looks like:
The Eclipse Ditto update command format looks like:

Eclipse Vorto Device Dashboard
React and NodeJS based Dashboard that helps quickly prototype IoT Device integrations with the Bosch IoT Suite.
Integrated IoT devices can be displayed and data visualized.
The Dashboard uses the Eclipse Vorto project to unify the definition of device capabilities and provides out-of-the-box visualization widgets that display sensor data in a visually appealing way.
Installation
Installing the dashboard is as easy as doing
npm install -g vorto-dashboard
Note that we are installing it as a global dependency which will allow you to call vorto-dashboard from your command line
You can provide your OAuth2 credentials through environment variables.
The three environment variables you have to provide are:
BOSCH_CLIENT_IDBOSCH_CLIENT_SECRETBOSCH_SCOPEREACT_APP_DEVICE_REFRESH_MS

The open source project Eclipse Vorto addresses this problem by providing cloud-based editors to abstract vendor-specific device payloads as re-usable Vorto Function Blocks. These are then aggregated to describe a whole device in the form of a Vorto Information Model. Information Models and Function Blocks are written in vortolang, a simple grammar to define interfaces between a physical device and its digital twin counterpart. IoT solutions communicate with physical devices only via these abstract Function Blocks and their co-related data schema. In this way, IoT solutions become de-coupled from the plethora of different device data formats, APIs, and encodings. But how to convert the device data to these abstract Function Block interfaces? Simple: with so-called Vorto Mapping Specifications, which contain all the necessary instructions in order to harmonize device-specific payloads.
In this tutorial, we are going to work ourselves throught the process of connecting various geolocation sensors to the cloud and consume their data in a simple cloud application. One of the challenges faced in IoT is that vendors use their own payload formats. JSON and CSV are two examples of payload formats. Vorto Mapping Specifications together with Normalisation Middleware is a mechanism we will use to normalise the various payload formats. Once this has been done, our application will be able to consume data originating from any geolocation sensor vendor. To achieve this, a Vorto Mapping specification must first be written for each expected payload format.
Steps to take
Create a small IoT application that receives geolocation data and prints it out in the console
Test the app by sending data via MQTT in different payload representations
Applying Vorto, to normalize the geolocation data. This would reduce the complexity in our app and only deal with a single geolocation representation, regardless of the connected sensors.
Pre-requisites
The Eclipse IoT stack offers a very nice device connectivity service, called Eclipse Hono, comprising many different protocol adapters. One of them is MQTT, exactly what we need in our solution to connect our sensors. To save us some time of setting up the service on our own, we use a free plan of an cloud operated Eclipse Hono service, provided by Bosch.
Here is a list of things that you need to work through this tutorial:
Bosch ID Account
Subscribe to Bosch IoT Hub (Free plan) for MQTT connectivity based on Eclipse Hono
Amazon MQ cloud service for AMQP messaging

Step 3: Download & Execute Mapping Specification
Download and save the Mapping Specification to start integrating it with the engine:
1. Add Maven dependency
<dependency>
<groupId>org.eclipse.vorto</groupId>
<artifactId>mapping-engine-all</artifactId>
<version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
2. Initialize the mapping engine with the downloaded specification
MappingEngine engine = MappingEngine.createFromInputStream(FileUtils.openInputStream(new File("src/main/resources/mappingspec.json")));
3. Pass the arbitrary device payload to the engine to get it converted to Vorto compliant data
Object deviceData = ...;
InfomodelValue mappedData = engine.map(deviceData);
4. Optionally validate the mapped data to check if it complies to the Vorto model
ValidationReport validationReport = mappedData.validate();
if (!validationReport.isValid()) {
vorto-dashboard config.json
This has to be in the format of:
In addition to that you can set the port the dashboard should run on by using the PORT environment variable.
The LOG_LEVEL env var can be used to change the logging level. By default this is error.
The Simulator has two additional env variables.
TIME_TO_LIVE defines the amount of seconds the simulator should run in total.
TIME_INTERVAL_TELEMETRY defines the amount of seconds between the sending of data points.

5. Convert mapped data to Digital Twin IoT compliant data
Convert the normalized Vorto compliant data to a target IoT platform format.
Currently supported target IoT Platform formats
AWS IoT Shadow Service
Eclipse Ditto Service
The following example shows how to convert the normalized data to AWS IoT Shadow Update Command:
import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
import org.eclipse.vorto.mapping.targetplatform.awsiot.TwinPayloadFactory;
...
JSONObject updateRequestAWSIoT = TwinPayloadFactory.toShadowUpdateRequest(mappedData);
sendToAWSIoTShadow(updateRequestAWSIoT,"com.acme:4711");
The following example shows how to convert the normalized data to Eclipse Ditto Update Command:
import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
import org.eclipse.vorto.mapping.targetplatform.ditto.TwinPayloadFactory;
...
In order to create a topology that can be displayed in the Sidebar, we need to follow a defined structure.
In addition to all your devices, you have to create at least one meta-thing that defines the root of the topology.
You can use the basic structre of a thing and define the attributes like this:
Note That the "definition": "org.eclipse.vorto:Topology:1.0.0" is the most important part since it defines this element as the root.
In order to add containers that hold entities, simply create another meta-model that holds similar content to the root (e.g. empyt features etc.).
Make sure to define the references and referencedBy fields in the attributes in order to tell the dashboard the structure.
Note The nesting can be repeated several times to create more complex structures.
By adding the topology attribute to regular Vorto Information Model things, you can also group things together visually.
Postman Script
Create a new local ENV setup that contains the following information.
SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID
TOKEN
TENANT_ID
PW_TYPE (simply use hashed-password)
Publishing a new release
Once changes have been merged into master and a new release tag has been created, an automated travis-ci job will be triggered that publishes the new version to NPM.

In this step, we create a tiny IoT solution that receives the sensor data and simply prints the data out to the console. But how do we get the data from Eclipse Hono? It's easy. Hono provides an AMQP endpoint that makes it possible for applications to receive telemetry data. Hono does not make any assumption how the payload looks like and merely forwards the data "as is" to the AMQP endpoint. Our application receives the data and does something useful with it. Well, in this case just prints it out to the console.
To save us some time at this point, we have already created the application for you. Download and then import it into your IDE
Open the src/main/resources/application.yml and configure the tenantId, username and password.
Where to find these values ? Login to Bosch IoT Suite Portal with your Bosch ID and click on Credentials.
Run the app with mvn spring-boot:run. You should not see any data coming in just yet. But we can change that quickly by sending some geolocation data to the MQTT endpoint.
Step 2: Sending geolocation data to Bosch IoT Hub using MQTT protocol
First let's register a device in the device registry under a specific device-id. Only then we can send data for that device-id to the Bosch IoT Hub.
Register devices
We can easily register our sample devices via the Device Registry Swagger UI
In order to use the API, you need to login via username and password. Therefore click on Authorize, and use the Bosch IoT Suite Portal again, to find the username and password values at the bottom of the Credentials page.
Register 2 devices 4711 and 4712 using the Device Registry Swagger UI. The following example shows the device registration for device with ID 4711:
{
"enabled": true,
"device-id": "4711"
}
Repeat the step for the second device.
Add device credentials for these 2 devices using the Credentials Swagger UI. The following example shows the credentials registration for a device with the ID 4711:

Repeat this step for the second device.
Publish data via MQTT
Download the Hub Server certificate curl -o iothub.crt https://docs.bosch-iot-hub.com/cert/iothub.crt
Use the mosquitto_pub client to send some geolocation data:
Verify the incoming data in our IoT application from step 1.
You should now see the data being printed out to the console in something like:
Send some data for our second device 4712. This time change the payload message representation to CSV style. Example:
The Eclipse Vorto Semantic Middleware is a small and light-weight microservice that is able to convert any device telemetry payload (binary, json, xml, ...) to semantic Vorto compliant data structures and exposes the data via AMQP or push it to AWS Kinesis. Other micro services can easily consume the data to further process it, e.g. for running analytics on the data.
The middleware provides an Integration API, where data processors can be plugged in, such as integrating the "harmonized data" with any 3rd party IoT data service.

Vorto Generator Plugins
Vorto Generators convert Vorto Models to any platform specific source code. This code can be a simple platform descriptor, device , or backend code. They are stateless in nature and can be easily developed using the Vorto Plugin SDK.
Checkout other Example Generators
Vorto Importer Plugins
Vorto Importers convert 3rd party platform descriptions to Vorto models. Just as Generator plugins, they are stateless and can easily be developed using the Vorto Plugin SDK.
To get started, checkout the LwM2M example, that converts LwM2M/IPSO XML descriptions to Vorto Function Block - and Mapping models. This example is deployed as a AWS Lambda service.
Using Vorto Models from your custom DSL
If you would like to use and reference Vorto Models from your own custom DSL, the following tutorial shows you how that is done.

For security reasons, the following restrictions apply when processing these converters:
access to Java packages and classes is not possible
using exit, quit, is not possible
file access is not possible
using loops are not allowed
no JS libraries can be loaded

In the following example, a custom (Javascript) converter is defined in a Function Block mapping, that converts a click amount as a String to an Integer value:

See my vorto-ditto-skeleton-generator project for reference how I'm using the generator as micro-service in a docker-container.
What is wrong?
The generator does not always traverse through the extends dependencies and return all of the configuration and status properties. This might be a bug or a flaw in my template.
How to reproduce
My used docker-compose file looks like this:
docker-compose.yml.txt
A working and verified image is on docker hub: lionax/vorto-ditto-skeleton-generator:latest
The vorto-variables.env looks like this:
# Generell settings
GENERATOR_USER=vorto_generators
GENERATOR_PASSWORD=1234
You should now also see the data of our second device in the console of our application.
You can already see from here, that our application would now need to be made aware of handling these two different ways of payload representations. This means writing additional custom code. No worries, let Eclipse Vorto take care of this.
Let us walk you through the process in the next step.
Step 3: De-coupling application from connected sensors
In this step, we are going to use Eclipse Vorto in order to de-couple our application from the connected sensors. This has the following benefits:
Reduced complexity and therefore development efforts in our IoT application. Our app can fully focus on processing one single data format, rather than many formats of different devices types.
1. Specifying the Geolocation interface with Vorto
As in traditional Software Design, we need to first think about the interfaces of the system as well as the data structures that are exchanged between devices and the IoT solution. Vorto provides a web-based tooling, that let's you easily define interfaces, so called Function Blocks. In our case, we are going to create a Geolocation Function Block:
Login to the Vorto Repository with your Bosch ID or Github ID account.
In order to start creating models, you need to first create your own namespace. Skip this step, if you already own a namespace
Click Explore in the menu and then click Create Model
Add the following status properties for the Geolocation and hit Save:
vortolang 1.0
namespace vorto.private.aedelmann // namespace can be different in your case

Mapping Conditions
If you want to specify a condition, when mapping rules for a Function Block should be applied, you can do this easily with mapping conditions.
Here is an example of using conditions to map to either temperature or illuminance Function Block based on the device payload header.
In this example, only the Temperature Function Block will be mapped, if the type field of header matches the 'T' value.

In this step, we will create an Information Model that implements the Geolocation Function Block. An Information Model represents a vendor - specific device.
Click Explore in the menu and then click Create Model
This time choose Information Model and work yourself through the wizard by giving it the name SensorOne and version 1.0.0.
In the popup Click Next and confirm with Create. This will take you directly to the newly created Information Model

This problem occurs, that generator invocation is extremely slow for bigger models. The mappings for the generator are always resolved unnecessarily upon every invocation which impacts performance.

The skeleton template can be found in my skeleton project on github.
How should it be?
If the template is correct, the generator should in any case return all properties of a model and it's parents.

using org.eclipse.vorto.DeviceInformation;1.0.0
infomodel SensorOne {
deviceInformation as DeviceInformation "gives further meta information about the sensor"
location as Geolocation "gives the position of the sensor"
}
}
3. Mapping device payload to Geolocation interface
Previously, we saw that both sensor types were sending data in different payload representations, JSON as well as CSV. Our solution ordinarily would need to parse these different payloads and somehow identify the semantics behind this payload.
In this step, we are going to map the JSON and CSV to the Geolocation Function Block. Vorto Mappings are a very nice way to do this, and pretty easy to boot.
Here is how its' done:
Click Explore and open the details of the SensorOne Information Model
Click Create Mapping which opens a dialog with some background information about mappings. Confirm with Create. This will open the Payload Mapping Editor
You will see two tabs, each for every Function Block property. Select deviceInformation tab
Our sensor does not really transmit any device information meta data. That's why we hard code these values here. Under manufacturer add "ACME Company". Make sure to add quote marks at the beginning and end of the provided manufacterer string.

There are quite a few exceptions in production logs due to:
Session invalid
User does not have permissions to access a model
Invalid characters used in search
Actual: ERROR is thrown
Expected: Handle these exceptions gracefully with an INFO message. Identify if there are more such exceptions which do not need to be thrown as an ERROR.

Open location mapping tab. Let's map the longitude and latitude to the Function Block.
For longitude add number:toFloat(/longitude) and for latitude add number:toFloat(/latitude)
Save your changes
Download the Spec and save it on your local system. You need this spec later in the tutorial.
We can now test the entire mapping by inserting a sample JSON in the input box on the right and hit Map:
{
"longitude" : "103.2",
"latitude" : "23.2"
}
You should be able to see the following mapped output:
{
"deviceInformation": {
"status": {

Introduction
This document specifies the Vorto Language (vortolang 1.0), a language for describing models and interfaces for IoT Digital Twins. Digital twins are models of entities in the physical world such as a (multi) sensor device, smart power plant, and other entities that participate in IoT solutions. Modeling enables IoT solutions and IoT platforms to provision, use, and configure IoT devices and logical entities from multiple sources in a single solution. Using the vortolang and describing the entities's capabilities, IoT platforms and IoT solutions can leverage the semantics of these IoT entities.
Digital Twin Vorto Language
Digital twins are described using the vortolang, which is domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL underlies a very simple grammar, making it very easy to describe digital twin models. In order to be used in IoT Platforms and solutions, the vortolang can easily be converted into well adopted languages, such as JSON-LD, where additional context-specific attributes can be added. Many (free) libraries are available to process these language files. At definition time, developers can use the vortolang without any knowledge about JSON-LD or others, and fully focus on describing the device capabilities in a very expressive way.
The vortolang is made up of a set of metamodel classes (described later in more detail) that define the capabilities of digital twins. There are two top-level classes, Information Model and Function Block, that describe a digital twin and the capabilities of digital twins, respectively. There are three metamodel classes that describe capabilities: Properties, Events, and Operations.

For the purpose of completion, these resources should also be available in the generated documentation.
Details:
/things resource should be added to the generated openAPI specifications. The return type should use the generic "Things" schema defined by IoT Things REST API.

Fantastic! You have just created a mapping for one sensor that sends its payload as JSON.
Create a mapping spec for your SensorTwo Information Model:
This time for manufacturer, set the value "Company XYZ"
The second sensor sends its geolocation payload as CSV. Therefore, add the following mapping for the longitude number:toFloat(array[1]) and for latitude number:toFloat(array[2]).
Save and download the mapping spec as well.
This completes the Vorto Modelling. In summary, we described two sensor types as Vorto Information Models, implementing the same Geolocation Function Block. We then created payload mappings for each of them, in order to map their specific payload to the same semantic Function Block definition.
In the next step, we are going to see these Vorto models and mappings in action.

When writing a digital twin definition, it's necessary to specify the version of the vortolang being used (currently 1.0)
Information Models and Function Blocks
There are two top-level metamodel classes: Information Model and Function Block. Information Models describe a complete digital twin, such as a physical device. Often, Information Models are associated with a specific device product, such as a "Bosch Dinion IP Starlight 8000MP" security camera, while Function Blocks describe the related capabilities of an digital twin (its status- and configuration properties, events, and operations). Function Blocks can be reused across different Information Models. Information Models are often made up of multiple Function Blocks (interfaces).

An Information Model describes a complete digital twin, such as a physical device and defines the set of interfaces as Function Blocks, implemented by the digital twin.

The isMultiplicity of a property in the generators API is still not behaving as expected in every scenario.
I tested the ditto schema generator on a vorto 0.12.4 instance and build the schema generator with the plugin api v0.12.4. The multiple -> array branches of the code aren't executed.

BooleanPropertyAttribute and EnumLiteralPropertyAttribute are existing in the vortolang 1.0, but are not yet included in the Swagger specification. They should be placed under schemas / ModelProperty / attributes.

4. Setting up Eclipse Vorto Payload Normalization Middleware with Vorto AMQP Plugin
As seen in the picture, we will now setup the Eclipse Vorto Payload Normalization Middleware, which is a micro service written in Java, that consumes data from Eclipse Hono via AMQP and converts the data to semantic data structures, defined as Vorto Function Blocks. For this, the middleware utilizes the Mapping Specification that we created in the previous step.
Now for the normalized data to be consumed by our IoT application we will send the normalized data from middleware to Amazon MQ and in the next step configure the IoT application to receive data from the new endpoint.
Create an Amazon MQ Broker using the tutorial from AWS here.
Now start the middleware using the Eclipse Vorto AMQP plugin and mounting a mappings folder which contains your sensor mapping specifications. We will configure our IoT Solution to subscribe to the new AMQP endpoint in the next step.
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v c:/absolute_local_dir:/mappings -e mapping_spec_dir=/mappings -e github.client.clientId=your_github_clientid -e github.client.clientSecret=your_github_clientsecret -e hono.tenantId=your_tenantId -e hono.password=your_hono_password -e amqp.url=OpenWire_endpoint -e amqp.topic.vorto=telemetry/vorto -e amqp.username=myusername -e amqp.password=mypassword eclipsevorto/vorto-normalizer:nightly
Before we can start sending data via MQTT again, we need to make some changes to the Bosch IoT Hub Device Registry. These changes are required by the Vorto middleware to work properly.
Open the Device Registry Swagger UI
Find the PUT Command , which updates your existing device ID. Add the following JSON content:
{
"enabled": true,
"device-id": "4711",
"defaults" : {
"vorto" : "<your_namespace>:SensorOne:1.0.0",
"content-type" : "application/json"
}

I'm still having this issue.
I tested the ditto schema generator on a vorto 0.12.4 instance and build the schema generator with the plugin api v0.12.4. The multiple -> array branches of the code won't get executed still.

Hi @somesh-kumar @aedelmann , I've started having a look and so far, I can categorize a couple of those cases, based on the error messages I got from AWS.
However, I'm having a hard time replicating anything consistently - maybe either of you can help me do that locally in an ad-hoc "discovery" session.

This basically overwrites the default configuration for this device ID by specifying the Vorto Information Model (device type) for the registered device as well as in what content-type the device sends its data.
Repeat this step for the second device ID (4712) , with the following content:
{
"enabled": true,
"device-id": "4712",
"defaults" : {
"vorto" : "<your_namespace>:SensorTwo:1.0.0",
"content-type" : "text/csv"
}
}
Finally! We are all set to start sending the same data as in step 2 using mosquitto_pub. You should be able to see the normalized payload with the exact same structure for both sensor types in the Vorto Middleware monitoring logs.

Session invalid --> suspect AbstractRepositoryController#unAuthorized --> change logging level would do.
User does not have permissions to access a model --> maybe this matches one or more of the exception handlers in AbstractRepositoryOperation#doInSession? In which case, either lower the logging level to warn or see caller if rethrown?
Invalid characters in search --> we had an initial conversation with Somesh but I forgot where we left it. It seems that spamming a few search requests containing the % character in the prod server consistently fails, but no e-mail seems to be sent after the threshold. The same fails locally, but is intercepted at Spring level. URL-encoding the text at front-end controller level doesn't seem to do anything. @somesh-kumar can we discuss replication again, and the last actions you've taken after our internal discussion? Your last statement was: "still waiting for an exception email to come to me, hoping we get the same error"

PR here.
As mentioned, my change set is weaksauce for now: it only lowers some logging levels to warning.
Per se, this should not be dangerous given the use cases, but it might contribute to clear some of the AWS threshold occurrences.
My take is we can iterate further once this is merged, and see if there is something missed out.

Change the configuration of the Geolocation IoT application, by pointing it to our new Amazon MQ Broker AMQP endpoint, in order to receive the normalized geolocation sensor data.
Please open the application.yml and replace the url, topic and credentials as seen below:
amqp:
username: TECHNICAL_USER_AMAZON_MQ_TO_PUBLISH
password: TECHNICAL_USER_AMAZON_MQ_PASSWORD
queue: telemetry/vorto
When you start the application and send data for the two sensors via MQTT, you will see the normalized geolocation data printed in the console of the application.
What's next?
Integrate with AWS Kinesis for realtime data analytics
Extend the solution with a digital twin service

Hi @mena-bosch
With your fix, lets keep an eye on the logs and see if your changes improved it. Nevertheless, I would recommend to specify an Exception Handling concept, with all possible errors that could occur in the system and define the measures that need to be taken. Lets create a separate issue for that. I would close this issue.

Download Vorto DSL Plugins and install it as an archive in your Eclipse IDE
Restart your Eclipse
Step 2: Create your DSL Xtext Plugins
Create a new DSL Xtext Project
File > New > Other > Xtext > Xtext Project
Choose a projectname and language name
Specify a file extension for your language, e.g. mysdl
Click on Finish.
After the wizard is finished, it will create five projects for you.
Your Project Browser would look something like this:
org.xtext.example.mydsl (core language plugin)
org.xtext.example.mydsl.ide
org.xtext.example.mydsl.ui
org.xtext.example.mydsl.tests
org.xtext.example.mydsl.ui.tests
Step 3: Reference Vorto Models from your DSL
We are primarily interested in the core language plugin, e.g. org.xtext.example.mydsl.

Eclipse Vorto: Interoperability for the Internet of Things
April 25, 2016
Jeroen Laverman, Jochen Scheib, Marco Wagner, Olaf Weinmann
#eclipse
#iot
Internet of Things image via Shutterstock
Interoperability is one of the key topics in the Internet of Things – and at the heart of this is the way in which individual, connected components work together. Communication between these elements makes sense only if the underlying language can actually be understood by the devices involved. Yet from a technological perspective, this can be difficult to achieve due to the wide variety of existing communication protocols. As a result, this calls for some means of translating between the individual languages.
Eclipse Vorto is an open source project set up to address this issue. It provides the technical capability required to describe the devices to be interconnected and their messages and helps define relevant mappings for translations. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the project and demonstrate its potential applications based on two detailed examples.

Vorto components
It is common knowledge that industry consortia and standardization organizations are working on various projects to define and standardize abstract descriptions for electronic devices. Some of this work is domain-specific, whereas some reaches across domain boundaries. Eclipse Vorto deliberately takes a technological approach that does not prescribe any one standard. Instead, it provides a handy toolkit designed to integrate smart devices into IoT platforms or applications, reduce the development work required, and facilitate interoperability. Vorto consists of the following three technical components:

Vorto repository
Code generator infrastructure
The IoT toolset is a well-structured and easy-to-use Eclipse application that enables users to create device descriptions known as “information models” on the basis of Vorto DSL (domain- specific language). As well as standard features such as syntax highlighting, auto completion, validation, etc., the toolset also offers integration with the Vorto Repository, which allows users to browse, check in, and check out information models. Code generators can also be run from within the toolset.
The key to Vorto component usability is ensuring that users do not have new formats “forced” on them. That’s why Vorto offers mechanisms that allow users to incorporate code generators, as these can convert Vorto-format device descriptions into different formats. Available formats include programming languages such as Java and C++, as well as formats for documentation purposes such as Markdown representations. It is also possible, however, to transform the models into formats defined by the standardization organizations and industry consortia mentioned above. Ultimately this means that users can retain their previously chosen format for device abstraction while still benefiting from the features of the Vorto project.
Example: communication in an automotive environment
Bosch Corporate Research is currently conducting a research project that uses Eclipse Vorto to describe the vehicle-to-cloud interface. The key data and services required for communication at this vehicle-to-cloud interface can be represented using Vorto. This makes these services and data available in a machine-readable format, which in turn makes automatic processing much simpler. In addition, the use of a common description language breaks down the barriers that still exist between the (physical) vehicle world and the (virtual) Internet of Things.
Services can also offer events that others can subscribe to. For example, to actually use the vehicle after warming it up, you need some charge in the battery. In this case, the battery could offer a service that allows you to check the battery charge level – and a “low battery” message would also be useful. An extract of the description can be seen in Listing 1, which uses the examples of the BatteryStatus and VehicleCommonDataType data types defined by W3C Vehicle Data [1].

Devices may not always send the data structure that is required by the IoT platform. The Vorto Payload Mapping lets you specify how device data is mapped to standardized data structures in form of Vorto Mapping Specifications and execute them in order to transform arbitrary device data to IoT platform specific data.

As you can notice, it imports the Vorto Information Model Ecore and use it from your own DSL grammar.
Open the *.mwe2 Workflow file and add a reference to the Vorto Model Ecore files. Since we only use Vorto Information Models from our DSL, we just reference those.

Step 4: Generate Xtext Source Code
If you are behind proxy, you would need to download ANTLR SDK manually, using the following Update Site: http://download.itemis.com/updates/. Once done so, please restart the IDE and continue with the following steps:
Find the GenerateMyDsl.mwe2 Workflow file in the core plugin project.
Right-click on the file and Run it. This will generate all necessary Xtext source code in order to run your language as an Eclipse Plugin
Now your language is all set. It's time to test it.
Step 5: Run & Test your DSL
Right-click on the core plugin project (e.g. org.xtext.example.mydsl) and run it in a new Eclipse Workbench. A new Eclipse Workbench instance starts up for your language. It automatically loads all Vorto Eclipse Plugins as well as your DSL plugins.
Create a new simple project
Add a new Vorto Information Model file to the project or download it from the Vorto Repository
Here is an example of a Vorto Information Model securitycamera.infomodel:
namespace org.mycompany.demo

Extending the Dashboard with custom widgets
Even though this will be extended in the future, you might want to create UI Cards for custom Function Blocks.
Note
In order to work with the development environment and get actual data from things, you have to start two processes.
The React Frontend dev server using npm start (sudo on Unix)
The NodeJS Backend that polls the data from things using node index.js config.json
Step by Step creating a custom Card
1. Open the project and duplicate the TemplateCard folder
2. Rename the copy to your to be created Card type
6. The last step is to set up the card itself. Head to the file of your card, get the values that should be displayed and create your the integration in the second <Row> element.
operations {
reset() returns boolean "resets the accelerometer"
}
}
Properties
Properties describe both read-only and read-write state of a digital twin. Read-only properties are defined as status properties, whereas read-write properties as configuration properties. For example, a device serial number may be a status property and the temperature set point on a thermostat may be a configuration property.
Function Block property is defined as a Model Property
Status Property Example
...
status {
mandatory serialNumber as string
}
}
Configuration Property Example
...
chargeLevel as short <MIN 0> "MUST return battery charge level (Unit: percentage)"
current as short <MIN 0> "Must return battery current (Unit: amperes)"
voltage as short <MIN 0> "MUST return battery voltage (Unit: volts)"
}
To generate code for communication on the basis of the descriptions discussed above, you also need corresponding mappings. These contain information on addressing modes, for example, as well as other protocol specifications used by the code generator.
A demonstrator was set up to evaluate the concept and to show how all the information required for communication can be generated on the basis of the existing Vorto description. It consists of three components: The electronic control unit (ECU) provides a service (e.g. Battery), which is made available to an external application via the connectivity control unit (CCU).
ASOME/IP implementation is used for communication inside the vehicle. SOME/IP is a service-oriented middleware solution specially developed and standardized for the automotive industry. External communication with the application makes use of the RESTful protocol CoAP, which is widely used in IoT environments.
Eclipse Californium is put to use here: the CoAP server and client implementations based on Eclipse Californium are currently being generated on the CoAP side. Looking beyond what is possible today, one option for SOME/IP in the future would be to generate the configuration file, which contains information including the description of the services. Eventually, the mapping table available in the CCU, which is used to translate between the two protocols, can be generated from the Vorto model and the mappings for CoAP and SOME/IP.

Example: interoperability in the Industry 4.0 environment
The semantic description of machines and field devices is playing an increasingly important role in industrial automation, particularly in the context of the fourth industrial revolution and the Internet of Things. Bosch Rexroth is one of several companies investigating potential applications for semantic descriptions in industrial automation.
The modularization of machines offers an opportunity to reduce complexity and increase the reusability of source code. Coupled with the distribution of the application across multiple resources, this facilitates the development of a flexible control architecture. One prerequisite is an efficient communication infrastructure that makes communication possible both locally and across a network infrastructure.
A further prerequisite is a description of the interfaces in order to enable interoperable communication. Bosch Rexroth is therefore carrying out projects to investigate various possibilities, including the use of the Eclipse Vorto Toolset in combination with technologies that are already established and standardized in industrial automation, such as AutomationML.
Representing production systems in the form of skills makes it possible to describe the underlying technical potential provided by a resource in a production system [2]. Resources can be divided into three basic categories:
Mechatronic systems (e.g. autonomous production systems and machines)

Add a new file for your DSL. The autocompletion editor feature kicks in and suggests you the SecurityCamera Information Model to choose for a reference:
Example:
namespace org.mycompany.demo
version 1.0.0
using org.mycompany.demo.SecurityCamera;1.0.0
system SmartBuilding {
cameraFirstFloor as SecurityCamera
cameraSecondFloor as SecurityCamera
}
Congratulations! You have just created a simple Xtext language project which references Vorto Information Models.

The Vorto project is an approach to leverage the standardization of so called Information Models. Information models are abstract representations of real world devices following a meta information model which is also part of the project. The meta information model is very flexible and easy to use. In addition, the project scope includes an eclipse based toolset that allows for creating information models, a repository for finding, managing and sharing information models, and last but not least a set of code generators that allow for the creation of information model based code artifacts to be employed in specific solutions.

Eclipse Vorto offers an optimum way to describe the skills of resources. What it does not offer, however, is a means of storing interdisciplinary information. This might include additional engineering data such as CAD drawings, process behaviors, or documentation on individual resources. Information from the overall system context (e.g. installation site and equipment identifier) also lies outside the scope of Vorto, even though this information is extremely important for developing production systems.
It is in this context that AutomationML has established itself as a container format in many areas of industrial automation. AutomationML is an XML format based on the CAEX standard (IEC 62424), and is used to describe system topologies, geometries and kinematics (COLLADA), logic and behavior (PLCopen XML) and semantics on the basis of libraries [4].
Embedding is carried out through a reference to the corresponding information model in the local or public Vorto Repository. References to external resources used by a specific resource can be modeled by a corresponding relation (interface) in AutomationML. Thanks to AutomationML’s instance hierarchy, it is then possible to model a complete production system. This is shown here based on a sample system.
The next step in the project is to investigate the potential applications of Vorto code generators in order to generate a communication framework for programmable logic controllers and enable the networking of resources.

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

Docker Modeshape Repo in MySQL by kolotu · Pull Request #2668 · eclipse/vorto · GitHub
@oscarfh
I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

@oscarfh
Ok, thanks a lot!

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.

@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace

@kolotu I found out: I am using a VPN for access, which reduces strongly my internet speed. It seems that it is timing out (works perfectly if I unplug the VPN). Is there any way for me to change the timeout period?

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml

In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB

I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

@ctron
Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
optional
string
a name of the enumeration model for human display
description
optional
string
A description for human display.
category
optional
string
Custom tag to categorize the model, e.g. sensor, smarthome/kitchen etc.
The name must match the regular expression:
name('/' name )*

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.
Tobias Månsson

I have to run, but I see run.py is referencing a application.yml which is not in the image. Should I add that to the /code directory?

Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

I have to run, but I see run.py is referencing a application.yml which is not in the image. Should I add that to the /code directory?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml
vorto/repository/repository-server/src/main/resources/vorto-repository-config-mysql.json
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB

I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something

Kevin Olotu

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Maintenance Announcement 22/9/2020There will be maintenance work on the main repository between 11AM-2PM CEST. The repository might be temporarily unavailable during that time frame.
The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

@mvniekerk

Announcement: a maintenance window is necessary for the Vorto dev application (vorto-dev.eclipse.org), starting in a few minutes.
The dev application will be unavailable for aproximately 3 hours this afternoon, starting in 15 minutes.
Will update this thread once the maintenance window is closed.
If you have urgent need of the environment this afternoon, please drop me a message.

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I don't have a table called modeshape_repository. :(
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
oh okay - let me check what the configuration in the container is. the repository can also be placed on the filesystem
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.

I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something

yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?

Hi @kolotu, thanks for your reply.
I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet

ADMIN_USER=oscarfh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
EIDP_CLIENT_ID=
EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?

Hey @demetz Yes the usage of multiple within a Functionblock with a Datatype is valid. The translation into Ditto would be a bit different however - instead of Gateway_id1, Gateway_id2, ... the proper translation would be using an array, but the logic you applied is indeed valid. It should look like this: "features": {

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?

I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I don't have a table called modeshape_repository. :(

@kolotu
oh okay - let me check what the configuration in the container is. the repository can also be placed on the filesystem

I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace

is something like this possible in vorto:[
"id1":{
"uplinkId":"",
"signalStrength":0.0,
"signalNoiseRatio":0.0
},
"id2": {
...
}
]
Thomas Jaeckle
@thjaeckle
ok, thanks. the downside with using an array is that it is very hard to query / write the data:somethimes, I might have 3 gateways picking up the signal from a sensor. at other times the signal from the same device is being picked up by only 1 gateway.

@demetz maybe you could use a dictionary ( https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/master/docs/vortolang-1.0.md#dictionary ) insteaddictionary[string, Gateway]the Ditto JSON Schema Generator however doesn't support dicitionaries yet, if I remember correctly
but mapping to JSON of a Vorto dictionary should be a plain JSON Object, e.g.:{
"signalNoiseRatio" : 0.0,
"frequency" : 0.0,
"dataRate" : 0.0,
"adaptiveDataRate" : false,
"frameCounter" : 0.0,
"batteryStatus" : 0.0,
"batteryVoltage" : 0.0,
"linkMargin" : 0.0
}

Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like

If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation

It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like

@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

Hello,I am trying to run Vorto using the docker compose as explained here: https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/tree/master/docker but I am not able to log in to github
Is this documentation still up to date?
I get the following error page: Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

Hi @oscarfh yes the documentation is still up to date - I just tried it and was not able to reproduce your issue. Could you please double check your configuration - especially your Github client ID and client secret?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
Hi @kolotu, thanks for your reply.
I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet
# Repository
DATASOURCE=mysql
AUTH_PROVIDER=github
ADMIN_USER=oscarfh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>

Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

I will try as soon as I can and get back to you

@kolotu I found out: I am using a VPN for access, which reduces strongly my internet speed. It seems that it is timing out (works perfectly if I unplug the VPN). Is there any way for me to change the timeout period?

@kolotu
@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option
