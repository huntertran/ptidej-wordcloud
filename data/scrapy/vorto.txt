Eclipse Foundation Website Privacy ...
Eclipse Foundation Website Privacy Policy
May 24, 2018
The Eclipse Foundation, Inc. ("Eclipse Foundation", "Us" or "We") is a member-supported not-for-profit foundation which acts as the steward of our open source projects, community, and ecosystem. We are committed to our community members’ rights to privacy. We promise to share transparently all aspects of how Eclipse Foundation projects and websites work in regards to privacy, terms, and personal data, and We are in full support of efforts to ensure your protection online. We only collect your personal data with your consent, and collect only as much as We need to provide you the service you request. For example, We need your personal data to register you to one of our conferences. Each time We collect additional personal data from you We will explain what We collect, why We need it, how We use it, how long We keep it, and how We protect it.
You can withdraw consent anytime. We will respect your wishes.
Personal Information on Eclipse Foundation Websites
As a platform for open source innovation and collaboration, personal information on all Eclipse Foundation websites is either meant to be shared, for example records of your contributions to our open source projects, or protected, such as your name and email address when you subscribe to our newsletter.
Any personal data you share with Us, We protect according to this Privacy policy.
Individual Access to Personal Information
We will respond within 30 days to your requests to have access to your personal information collected by Us. We will promptly correct inaccuracies, as the case may be, and We will delete it and/or anonymize it upon your request. Please contact
privacy@eclipse.org
to make such a request.
Information Security and Quality
We protect the integrity of your personal information with appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as using encryption for transmission of certain forms of information, to help keep it secure, accurate, current, and complete.
Your personal information may be stored in Canada, the European Union and the United States, always with our same high security standards.
One of the primary purposes of the Eclipse Foundation and its websites is to enable collaborative open source software development. Doing so necessarily requires Us to maintain records of authorship related to all contributions. Any personally identifiable information collected by virtue of your contributions will be publicly available on the Internet in unencrypted form and without access restriction.
We also offer services to our community which provide the ability for users of Eclipse software to store data on Eclipse Foundation servers through services including, but not limited to, the User Storage Service and the Automated Error Reporting Initiative. Any data stored through these services will be publicly available on the Internet in unencrypted form and without access restriction. Therefore, you should not use these services to store passwords, any personally identifiable information, any confidential business information, or anything else that you do not want to be generally and publicly available.
Clickstream Data and Cookies
We sometimes collect anonymous information from visits and contributions to Eclipse Foundation websites to help provide better service. For example, We keep track of the domains from which people visit and We also measure visitor activity on Eclipse Foundation websites, but in ways that keep the information anonymous. This anonymous information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." We may use and aggregate this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help Us tailor our websites to better serve Eclipse participants.

Resources for Committers
Due Diligence Process:
This document provides a quick pictorial overview of the due diligence process.
Third Party Dependencies:
This document contains the guidelines for the review of third-party dependencies.
Committer Guidelines:
This document outlines the issues to be aware of and the processes one should follow when working as a committer on Eclipse.org projects. A committer is a person that has been granted commit rights to systems on the Eclipse.org servers such as git repositories, web pages, download servers, mailing lists and so forth.
Contribution Questionnaire:
A Contribution Questionnaires (CQ) is the main interface between Eclipse committers and the Intellectual Property Management Team. Prior to committing a significant contribution of content to an Eclipse Foundation project, the committer must fill out this questionnaire and submit it to the Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) for approval. In addition to the EMO, the relevant PMC must also provide a technical review and approval of the contribution. Follow the link to find out more about what we mean by "significant contribution". Bug fixes or minor enhancements do not require PMC or EMO approval.

Development Resources/Process Guidelines/What is Incubation
<
Development Resources
Project committers are invited to join the
Incubation mailing list
to discuss issues related to incubation, ask questions of project mentors, and just generally connect with other members of the community involved with projects in the incubation phase.
What is Incubation?
See "
6.2.3 Incubation Phase
" in the Eclipse Development Process.
The web page you were last at belongs to an Eclipse Project that is in the Incubation Phase. Incubation indicates that the Eclipse community is helping this project "learn the ropes" about being a full open source project producing high quality extensible frameworks and exemplary tools. Projects typically stay in the incubation phase for a year or two before graduating to the Mature Phase.
The classification of a project in the Incubation Phase is not a statement about the quality of the project's code - it may be good (in fact, Eclipse Projects are often excellent), it may not - as with all open-source projects, that is for you to decide. Rather, Incubation Phase is more about the project team's progress in practicing the open and public processes necessary to establish the three communities (developers, adopters, and users) around the project.
For more information about Incubation Phase, read the
Eclipse Development Process
and/or the
Guidelines for Incubation Phase
.
