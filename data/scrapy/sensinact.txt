The Eclipse sensiNact project consists of a software platform enabling the collection, processing and redistribution of any data relevant to improving the quality of life of urban citizens, programming interfaces allowing different modes of access to data (on-demand, periodic, historic, etc.) and application development and deployment to easily and rapidly build innovative applications on top of the platform.
Here a quick look to the existing data available via sensiNact platform from various cities such as Santander, Genova, Fujisawa and Osaka (click the "+" button and click "Add" accepting the default gateway configuration data)
sensiNact particularly deals with the following 4 topics.
Connectivity
Heterogeneity of data is today’s reality in every urban environment. Emerging IoT devices, legacy systems, increasing number of social networks, mobile applications, open data repositories and web data are the potential exploitable data sources. sensiNact thus provides connectivity support to those data sources including today’s IoT protocols and platforms such as LoRa, Zigbee, IEEE 802.15.4, Sigfox, enOcean, MQTT, XMPP, NGSI, HTTP, CoAP, etc. With its modular approach, connectivity support for new protocols can be rapidly developed and dynamically added to the platform, even at run-time.
Interoperability
sensiNact platform provides a unified view over those heterogeneous sources of data and action. With the lack of a de facto standard data model today in the IoT domain, sensiNact adopts a generic and extensible data model to facilitate building adapters for various protocols. It’s core model based on 4 types of resources: sensor data, action, state variables, and properties.
Those resources are accessible by generic and easy to use Application Programming Interfaces (API) providing synchronous (on demand) and asynchronous (periodic or event based) access to data/actions of IoT devices, as well as access to historic data.
Data and event processing
Developer tool
On top of the platform, sensiNact proposes a development tool (sensiNact Studio) that allows managing devices/services connected to the platform and rapidly creating applications and deploying them to the platform. It is a service composition tool which assists developers in building applications by binding the services via events and actions. With a Domain Specific Language, the developers can express the application logic in terms of ECA (Event-Condition-Action) rules, which is verified and validated by the tool before its deployment into the sensiNact platform. The application developers can then remotely monitor and manage applications (install, start, stop, uninstall, etc.). The tool also provides means to easily build support for new types of protocols and platforms and add it to the platform on-the-fly.
We can list the features of sensiNact as a glance as follows:
• Plug&play: Device as a Service Approach. The flexibility of adding/removing/updating devices with a minimum impact on the running platform ;
• Modular: Modular development and deployment for enhanced system maintenance and evolution ;
• Dependable: sensiNact’s formal data and service models facilitate reliable IoT applications development ;
• Scalable: sensiNact’s three layers architecture (device/gateway/cloud) allows distribution of data processing at different levels ;
• Easy&quick: sensiNact’s comprehensive data model and APIs help to rapidly build IoT applications.

Type: CreationState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, April 5, 2017Project: Eclipse sensiNactProposal:
Eclipse sensiNact
Parent Project: Eclipse TechnologyBackground: The world is facing a number of critical challenges such as global warming, economic crisis, security threats, inequality, natural disasters and ageing society. Urban areas are particularly affected, given that the world population is increasingly concentrated in those areas, which is expected to be 66% by 2050.
While occupying 2% of the earth's surface, cities use 75% of the world resources. Those resources in civil infrastructure such as water, energy, public transportation, parking spaces, buildings, roads, bridges, etc., as well as natural resources and economic resources need to be shared by this increasing population. This has direct consequences for urban citizens and for the city itself.
Ranging from social to economic aspects, IoT and big data provide countless possibilities to enhance the quality of life and security of people, while at the same time reducing inequalities and providing new revenue opportunities for enterprising businesses, from large groups and public administrations to SMEs, startups and web entrepreneurs.
The unprecedented number of connected things in urban environments and the need to process the associated big data naturally raises new technical challenges in terms of interoperability, data and connectivity heterogeneity, scalable and online data processing, actionable knowledge extraction, security and privacy. Eclipse sensiNact project has been created to bring a community of developers and other smart city stakeholders together who will tackle those challenges with an open approach aiming at fostering smart city business ecosystem.
Scope: The Eclipse sensiNact project will in particular be dealing with the following technical aspects related to smart city platforms:
Connectivity: providing support for gathering data from various sources in urban environments (IoT devices, legacy devices, open data, social networks, participatory sensing mobile applications, etc.)
Interoperability: providing interoperability among heterogeneous urban data; providing developer friendly interfaces to access to data and action resources in cities in a uniformed way, supporting various state of the art remote access protocols
Data processing: mechanisms to extract actionable information from raw data

Developer Tool: providing a tool to build/deploy/manage smart city applications in an easy yet dependable way
Description: The Eclipse sensiNact project consists of a software platform enabling the collection, processing and redistribution of any data relevant to improving the quality of life of urban citizens, programming interfaces allowing different modes of access to data (on-demand, periodic, historic, etc.) and application development and deployment to easily and rapidly build innovative applications on top of the platform.
sensiNact particularly deals with the following 4 topics.
Connectivity: Heterogeneity of data is today’s reality in every urban environment. Emerging IoT devices, legacy systems, increasing number of social networks, mobile applications, open data repositories and web data are the potential exploitable data sources. sensiNact thus provides connectivity support to those data sources including today’s IoT protocols and platforms such as LoRa, Zigbee, IEEE 802.15.4, Sigfox, enOcean, MQTT, XMPP, NGSI, HTTP, CoAP, etc. With its modular approach, connectivity support for new protocols can be rapidly developed and dynamically added to the platform, even at run-time.
Interoperability: sensiNact platform provides a unified view over those heterogeneous sources of data and action. With the lack of a de facto standard data model today in the IoT domain, sensiNact adopts a generic and extensible data model to facilitate building adapters for various protocols. It’s core model based on 4 types of resources: sensor data, action, state variables, and properties.
Those resources are accessible by generic and easy to use Application Programming Interfaces (API) providing synchronous (on demand) and asynchronous (periodic or event based) access to data/actions of IoT devices, as well as access to historic data.
Data and event processing
Developer tool
On top of the platform, sensiNact proposes a development tool (sensiNact Studio) that allows managing devices/services connected to the platform and rapidly creating applications and deploying them to the platform. It is a service composition tool which assists developers in building applications by binding the services via events and actions. With a Domain Specific Language, the developers can express the application logic in terms of ECA (Event-Condition-Action) rules, which is verified and validated by the tool before its deployment into the sensiNact platform. The application developers can then remotely monitor and manage applications (install, start, stop, uninstall, etc.). The tool also provides means to easily build support for new types of protocols and platforms and add it to the platform on-the-fly.

Eclipse Public Licence
Dependencies to software having Eclipse conflictual licenses such as GPL, are not critical.
Legal Issues: The sensiNact name is not owned by any entity. Currently sensiNact code is not licensed. sensiNact name is used in some collaborative projects as a software platform developed by CEA.
The project uses third party software with various license types such as Apache v2.0 and EPL, JSON and MIT. In principle, sensiNact has no strong binding to any Eclipse conflictual license.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 1.0Project Scheduling: sensiNact code is ready to be provided as a first contribution. It already includes its first build. We plan to do regular releases in agile methodology, with intervals of no more than 6 months.
· Connectivity: we are continuously looking for opportunities to integrate support for additional connectivity protocols. We will provide bridges for various emerging communication standards such as Thread, OneM2M, OMA LWM2M, OPC-UA, etc. We are planning to take benefit of Eclipse IoT open source projects to implement the necessary bridges for those protocols.
· Interoperability: we would like to add semantic interoperability support to the sensiNact. We would like to look at closer to W3C web of things initiative. CEA as a member of OSGi IoT Expert Group member, we would like to bring reference implementation of IoT related specifications of the OSGi Alliance.
CEA is committing to actively support the project, with at least 4 FTE. We are planning to actively participate to developer events (organized by Eclipse, as well as other national and international initiatives), as well as creating sensiNact specific events, in order to present our project to the community and attract users and developers. We are planning to reach national stakeholders using our various offices established all over France to transfer CEA technology to local industry. In addition, CEA is an active member in the European smart city ecosystem and has been coordinating and participating to several related collaborative projects involving numerous industrial and academic partners, which will certainly be part of the ecosystem we will create around the platform. CEA is also an active member of the European IoT Platform Initiative (IoT-EPI) and planning to create a smart city related working group within the Eclipse Foundation. As a member of Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC), CEA will also promote Eclipse sensiNact project towards IIC members.

Eclipse sensiNact (lower-case on the first s and capital letter on the second N) aims at creating a common environment in which heterogeneous devices can exchange information and interact among each other in the IoT world.
Eclipse sensiNact is composed of two tools, sensiNact Gateway aiming at integrating devices and aggregating data from various sources and sensiNact Studio aiming at interacting with the sensiNact Gateway to visualize the devices and the data.

Eclipse QVT Operational
Language
Modeling
sensiNact is a horizontal platform dedicated to IoT and in particularly used in various smart city and smart home applications. sensiNact aims at managing IoT protocols and devices heterogeneity and provides synchronous (on demand) and asynchronous (periodic or event based) access to data/actions of IoT devices, as well as access to historic data with generic and easy-to-use API. To achieve these objectives, sensiNact comes with two complementary frameworks:
sensiNact Gateway interconnects IoT devices using different southbound IoT protocols such as Zigbee, EnOcean, LoRa, XBee, MQTT, XMPP, as well as platforms such as FIWARE and allows access to them with various northbound protocols such as HTTP REST, MQTT, XMPP, JSON RPC and CDMI. The gateway can also host applications and manage them using an application manager module.
sensiNact Studio proposes an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) based on Eclipse to manage the existing devices, in addition to develop, deploy and manage IoT applications.

Status message
This proposal has been approved and the Eclipse sensiNact project has been created.
Eclipse sensiNact
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse Technology
Background: The world is facing a number of critical challenges such as global warming, economic crisis, security threats, inequality, natural disasters and ageing society. Urban areas are particularly affected, given that the world population is increasingly concentrated in those areas, which is expected to be 66% by 2050.
While occupying 2% of the earth's surface, cities use 75% of the world resources. Those resources in civil infrastructure such as water, energy, public transportation, parking spaces, buildings, roads, bridges, etc., as well as natural resources and economic resources need to be shared by this increasing population. This has direct consequences for urban citizens and for the city itself.
Ranging from social to economic aspects, IoT and big data provide countless possibilities to enhance the quality of life and security of people, while at the same time reducing inequalities and providing new revenue opportunities for enterprising businesses, from large groups and public administrations to SMEs, startups and web entrepreneurs.
The unprecedented number of connected things in urban environments and the need to process the associated big data naturally raises new technical challenges in terms of interoperability, data and connectivity heterogeneity, scalable and online data processing, actionable knowledge extraction, security and privacy. Eclipse sensiNact project has been created to bring a community of developers and other smart city stakeholders together who will tackle those challenges with an open approach aiming at fostering smart city business ecosystem.
Scope: The Eclipse sensiNact project will in particular be dealing with the following technical aspects related to smart city platforms:
Connectivity: providing support for gathering data from various sources in urban environments (IoT devices, legacy devices, open data, social networks, participatory sensing mobile applications, etc.)
Interoperability: providing interoperability among heterogeneous urban data; providing developer friendly interfaces to access to data and action resources in cities in a uniformed way, supporting various state of the art remote access protocols

Data processing: mechanisms to extract actionable information from raw data
Developer Tool: providing a tool to build/deploy/manage smart city applications in an easy yet dependable way
Description: The Eclipse sensiNact project consists of a software platform enabling the collection, processing and redistribution of any data relevant to improving the quality of life of urban citizens, programming interfaces allowing different modes of access to data (on-demand, periodic, historic, etc.) and application development and deployment to easily and rapidly build innovative applications on top of the platform.
sensiNact particularly deals with the following 4 topics.
Connectivity: Heterogeneity of data is today’s reality in every urban environment. Emerging IoT devices, legacy systems, increasing number of social networks, mobile applications, open data repositories and web data are the potential exploitable data sources. sensiNact thus provides connectivity support to those data sources including today’s IoT protocols and platforms such as LoRa, Zigbee, IEEE 802.15.4, Sigfox, enOcean, MQTT, XMPP, NGSI, HTTP, CoAP, etc. With its modular approach, connectivity support for new protocols can be rapidly developed and dynamically added to the platform, even at run-time.
Interoperability: sensiNact platform provides a unified view over those heterogeneous sources of data and action. With the lack of a de facto standard data model today in the IoT domain, sensiNact adopts a generic and extensible data model to facilitate building adapters for various protocols. It’s core model based on 4 types of resources: sensor data, action, state variables, and properties.
Those resources are accessible by generic and easy to use Application Programming Interfaces (API) providing synchronous (on demand) and asynchronous (periodic or event based) access to data/actions of IoT devices, as well as access to historic data.
Data and event processing
Developer tool
On top of the platform, sensiNact proposes a development tool (sensiNact Studio) that allows managing devices/services connected to the platform and rapidly creating applications and deploying them to the platform. It is a service composition tool which assists developers in building applications by binding the services via events and actions. With a Domain Specific Language, the developers can express the application logic in terms of ECA (Event-Condition-Action) rules, which is verified and validated by the tool before its deployment into the sensiNact platform. The application developers can then remotely monitor and manage applications (install, start, stop, uninstall, etc.). The tool also provides means to easily build support for new types of protocols and platforms and add it to the platform on-the-fly.
We can list the features of sensiNact as a glance as follows:
• Plug&play: Device as a Service Approach. The flexibility of adding/removing/updating devices with a minimum impact on the running platform.
• Modular: Modular development and deployment for enhanced system maintenance and evolution

Who's Involved
• Dependable: sensiNact’s formal data and service models facilitate reliable IoT applications development.
• Scalable: sensiNact’s three layers architecture (device/gateway/cloud) allows distribution of data processing at different levels.
• Easy&quick: sensiNact’s comprehensive data model and APIs help to rapidly build IoT applications.
We believe that Eclipse provides a perfect environment to make our project reach its objectives, in terms of efficient project management, in terms of reaching a large number of developers and in terms of creating a business ecosystem.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 1.0Legal Issues: The sensiNact name is not owned by any entity. Currently sensiNact code is not licensed. sensiNact name is used in some collaborative projects as a software platform developed by CEA.
The project uses third party software with various license types such as Apache v2.0 and EPL, JSON and MIT. In principle, sensiNact has no strong binding to any Eclipse conflictual license.
Project Scheduling: sensiNact code is ready to be provided as a first contribution. It already includes its first build. We plan to do regular releases in agile methodology, with intervals of no more than 6 months.
· Connectivity: we are continuously looking for opportunities to integrate support for additional connectivity protocols. We will provide bridges for various emerging communication standards such as Thread, OneM2M, OMA LWM2M, OPC-UA, etc. We are planning to take benefit of Eclipse IoT open source projects to implement the necessary bridges for those protocols.
· Interoperability: we would like to add semantic interoperability support to the sensiNact. We would like to look at closer to W3C web of things initiative. CEA as a member of OSGi IoT Expert Group member, we would like to bring reference implementation of IoT related specifications of the OSGi Alliance.
CEA is committing to actively support the project, with at least 4 FTE. We are planning to actively participate to developer events (organized by Eclipse, as well as other national and international initiatives), as well as creating sensiNact specific events, in order to present our project to the community and attract users and developers. We are planning to reach national stakeholders using our various offices established all over France to transfer CEA technology to local industry. In addition, CEA is an active member in the European smart city ecosystem and has been coordinating and participating to several related collaborative projects involving numerous industrial and academic partners, which will certainly be part of the ecosystem we will create around the platform. CEA is also an active member of the European IoT Platform Initiative (IoT-EPI) and planning to create a smart city related working group within the Eclipse Foundation. As a member of Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC), CEA will also promote Eclipse sensiNact project towards IIC members.
