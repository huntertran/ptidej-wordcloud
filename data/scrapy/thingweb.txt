The Eclipse Thingweb project currently hosts one sub-project and plans for a second one.
Thingweb node-wot
node-wot is the official reference implementation of the W3C WoT Working Group and implements the so-called "Servient Architecture":
node-wot provides a
WoT Thing Description
parser and serializer, several "Protocol Bindings" implementing the
WoT Binding Templates
, as well as a runtime system ("WoT Runtime") providing the
WoT Scripting API
for applications. It is based on Node.js and its fundamental module structure.
node-wot also provides a browser bundle to visualize TDs and to enable the interaction with Things from the Web browser. A simple example can be found here:
WebUI
Thingweb Directory (planned)
A Thing Directory is a directory service for WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs) that provides a Web interface to register TDs (aligned with
draft-ietf-core-resource-directory
) and look them up (e.g., using SPARQL queries or CoRE Link Format). The Thingweb Directory implements this service using the
Apache Jena
triple store and SPARQL endpoint.

Thingweb
Thingweb is a runtime and tooling for web technology that enables
easy creation of applications for the Internet of Things
Hands-on
News
A Web of Things implementation
Thingweb is an implementation of the WoT Model discussed in the
W3C WoT WG
. It is simply a toolkit with some demo applications enabling you to create and experiment with WoT applications.
The Web of Things seeks to counter the fragmentation of the IoT through standard complementing building blocks (e.g., metadata and APIs) that enable easy integration across IoT platforms and application domains.
We provide sevices to support exploring W3C WoT

To use in a browser
To use node-wot as a browser-side JavaScript Library, the browser needs to support ECMAScript 2015. Supported browsers include:
Microsoft Edge 15 and later
Firefox 54 and later
Chrome 58 and later
Safari 10 and later
Using a browser with only ES5 support (eg. IE 11) might be possible if you add polyfills.
How to get the library
As a Node.js dependency
You can install node-wot in the following ways:
As a normal dependency (i.e., like loadsh). In this case, you are embedding a servient inside your application.
As a CLI to run scripts. In this case, your application is running inside the default servient.
Normal Dependency
If you want to use node-wot as a library in your Node.js application, you can use npm to install the node-wot packages that you need. To do so,
cd
inside you application folder, and run:
Now, you can implement your node-wot entry point, e.g.,
main.js
as follows:
You can then start the application by running
node main.js
.
CLI Tool
You can alternatively install the node-wot CLI, either globally (
npm i @node-wot/cli -g
) or as a (dev) dependency (
npm i @node-wot/cli --save
or
npm i @node-wot/cli --save-dev
).
Then, you don't need to specify any further node-wot dependencies and can implement your application (e.g.,
main.js
) without explicitly requiring node-wot dependencies:
If the CLI is globally installed, you don't need to set up a Node.js project. If you do so, anyway, you can specify the entry point as follows:
There are several ways to start the application:
a. Execute
npm start
.
b. Execute
./node_modules/.bin/wot-servient main.js
.
c. Execute
node ./node_modules/@node-wot/cli/dist/cli.js main.js
.
d. If you have installed
@node-wot/cli
globally you can even start the application right away using this command
wot-servient main.js
. However, in the current implementation, the import of local dependencies is not supported in this case.
wot-servient can execute multiple files at once, for example as follows:
Finally, to debug use the option
--inspect
or
--inspect-brk
if you want to hang until your debug client is connected. Then start Chrome Dev Tools or
vscode debugger
or your preferred v8 inspector to debug your code.
For further details check:
wot-servient --help
As a standalone application
Clone and build
Clone the repository:
Go into the repository:
Install root dependencies (locally installs tools such as
typescript
and
lerna
):
Use
tsc
to transcompile TS code to JS in dist directory for each package:
Note: This step automatically calls
npm run bootstrap
.
Optional steps
Link Packages
Make all packages available on your local machine (as symlinks). You can then use each package in its local version via
npm link <module>
instead of
npm install <module>
(see also
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link
).
(On Windows omit
sudo
)
Link Local wot-typescript-definitions
To evolve the Scripting API in development, you need to use a locally changed version of the
wot-typescript-definitions
. Use npm link for this as well:
(On Windows omit
sudo
)
In each node-wot package, link the local version made available in the previous step:
(On Windows omit
sudo
)
Optimization
To reduce the size of the installation from about 800 MByte down to about 200 MByte, you can run the following commands (currently only tested on Linux):
yarn init
yarn add [packages]
npm run build
lerna init
lerna exec 'npm prune --production'
Trouble shooting
Build error around
node-aead-crypto
node-gyp has been seen failing on MacOS
try node 10+, which does not require the crypto polyfill
Build error about
No matching version found for @node-wot/...
or something about
match
try
npm run unlock
from project root before building
sudo npm run link
does not work
try
npm run unlock
from project root before calling
[sudo] npm run link
try
npm link
in each package directory in this order: td-tools, core, binding-*, cli, demo-servients
Build error around
prebuild: npm run bootstrap
This has been seen failing on WSL. Try using Node 12.13.0
As a browser library
Node-wot can also be imported as browser-side library. To do so, include the following
script
tag in your html:
No time for explanations - show me a running example!
Using Node.js
Run all the steps above including "Link Packages" and then run this:
Without the "Link Packages" step, the
wot-servient
command is not available and
node
needs to be used (e.g., Windows CMD shell):
Go to
http://localhost:8080/counter
and you'll find a thing description
Query the count by
http://localhost:8080/counter/properties/count
Modify the count via POST on
http://localhost:8080/counter/actions/increment
and
http://localhost:8080/counter/actions/decrement
Application logic is in
examples/scripts/counter.js
Using a browser
An example of how to use node-wot as a browser-side library can be found under
examples/browser/index.html
. To run it, open
examples/browser/index.html
in a modern browser, and consume the test Thing available under
http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8083/testthing
to interact with it.
The JavaScript code that uses node-wot as a library to power this application can be found under:
examples/browser/index.js
How to use the library
The API
This library implements the WoT Scripting API:
Editors Draft
in
master
Working Draft
corresponding to node-wot
release versions
You can also see
examples/scripts
to have a feeling of how to script a Thing.
Logging
We used to have a node-wot-logger package to allow fine-grained logging (by means of Winston). It turned out though that depending on the actual use-case other logging libraries might be better suited. Hence we do not want to prescribe which logging library to use. Having said that, we use console statements which can be easily overriden to use the prefered logging library if needed (see
here
).
The logs in the library follows those best practice rules (see
here
):
Tag log messages with the package as following:
console.debug("[package-name]", "log message)
. This is useful to identify which package generated the log.
Avoid to use
info
and
log
in packages other than the cli package.
Please follows these rules if you are going to contribute to node-wot library.
Install new/different versions of NodeJS
Using NPM, you can install NodeJS independent from the usually outdated package managers such as apt. This is nicely done by n:
To get the "stable" version:
To get the "latest" version:
Finally, make the node command available through:

The Eclipse Thingweb project is intended as an
open-source toolkit for the Web of Things ecosystem
with modular implementations of the technological building blocks standardized by the W3C. The toolkit may include implementations of the same building block for different platforms, frameworks, or languages. The initial building blocks currently being standardized are:
Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description
Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates
Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API
The first phase of W3C WoT standardization activity already ended and yielded to a recommendation for the Thing Description. The WoT Working Group was re-chartered to standardize the next set of building blocks and to advance the existing ones. The former is being explored and identified by the WoT Interest Group, which operates in parallel to the Working Group. Thingweb intends to grow with new building blocks being defined in the future. This may include early work by the WoT Interest Group that is not part of the standards track yet.
Furthermore, Thingweb shall include auxiliary tools for the WoT ecosystem such as user interfaces or visualizers for Things, converters to the Thing Description and its serializations, semantic processors around the Thing Description, etc.

thingweb-directory
The Thingweb Directory is an open source directory for Thing Descriptions. The
Thing Description (TD) model
is a recommendation of the W3C Web of Things working group to describe Things. The directory features an API to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a TD. The directory can be used to
browse
and
discover
Searching for a Thing based on its metadata, properties, actions or events;
Creating a new Thing's TD or updating an existing one;

To use in a browser
To use node-wot as a browser-side JavaScript Library, the browser needs to support ECMAScript 2015. Supported browsers include:
Microsoft Edge 15 and later
Firefox 54 and later
Chrome 58 and later
Safari 10 and later
Using a browser with only ES5 support (eg. IE 11) might be possible if you add polyfills.
How to get the library
As a Node.js dependency
You can install node-wot in the following ways:
As a normal dependency (i.e., like loadsh). In this case, you are embedding a servient inside your application.

As a CLI to run scripts. In this case, your application is running inside the default servient.
Normal Dependency
If you want to use node-wot as a library in your Node.js application, you can use npm to install the node-wot packages that you need. To do so,
cd
inside you application folder, and run:
Now, you can implement your node-wot entry point, e.g.,
main.js
as follows:
You can then start the application by running
node main.js
.

You can alternatively install the node-wot CLI, either globally (
npm i @node-wot/cli -g
) or as a (dev) dependency (
npm i @node-wot/cli --save
or
npm i @node-wot/cli --save-dev
).
Then, you don't need to specify any further node-wot dependencies and can implement your application (e.g.,
main.js
) without explicitly requiring node-wot dependencies:
If the CLI is globally installed, you don't need to set up a Node.js project. If you do so, anyway, you can specify the entry point as follows:
There are several ways to start the application:
a. Execute
npm start
.
b. Execute
./node_modules/.bin/wot-servient main.js

Link Packages
Make all packages available on your local machine (as symlinks). You can then use each package in its local version via
npm link <module>
instead of
npm install <module>
(see also
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link
).
(On Windows omit
sudo
)
Link Local wot-typescript-definitions
To evolve the Scripting API in development, you need to use a locally changed version of the
wot-typescript-definitions
Sebastian Kaebisch is a Committer for Eclipse Thingweb | projects.eclipse.org
. Use npm link for this as well:
(On Windows omit
sudo
)
In each node-wot package, link the local version made available in the previous step:
(On Windows omit
sudo
)
Optimization
To reduce the size of the installation from about 800 MByte down to about 200 MByte, you can run the following commands (currently only tested on Linux):
yarn init
yarn add [packages]
npm run build
lerna init
lerna exec 'npm prune --production'

Logging
We used to have a node-wot-logger package to allow fine-grained logging (by means of Winston). It turned out though that depending on the actual use-case other logging libraries might be better suited. Hence we do not want to prescribe which logging library to use. Having said that, we use console statements which can be easily overriden to use the prefered logging library if needed (see

The logs in the library follows those best practice rules (see

Tag log messages with the package as following:
console.debug("[package-name]", "log message)

Avoid to use

Please follows these rules if you are going to contribute to node-wot library.

Eclipse Thingweb
Proposal:
Eclipse Thingweb
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
There is broad agreement about the huge potential for services for the Internet of Things (IoT) across a wide range of application domains, e.g., homes, offices, healthcare, cities, electrical grids, retail, and manufacturing. However, this potential is being held back by fragmentation with a lack of interoperability across platforms, a bewildering variety of standards, and a rapid evolution of the low-level IoT technologies themselves.
The
W3C Web of Things (WoT)
seeks to counter the fragmentation of the IoT by using and extending Web standards (e.g., metadata and APIs) and providing re-usable technological building blocks in order to enable easy integration across IoT platforms and application domains. This is expected to drive down the costs and risks involved in developing services, and help realizing the full potential for the IoT. In short, W3C WoT seeks to extend the Web from a Web of pages to a Web of Things.
The abstract architecture of the Web of Things spans from the device level over edge nodes such as gateways to the cloud. The technological building blocks are intended to be of use at any level and foster a Web-like experience for the Internet of Things. A detailed introduction to the abstract architecture and deployment scenarios, but also use cases and requirements can be found in the
Web of Things (WoT) Architecture
document, a W3C Working Draft.
Scope:
The Eclipse Thingweb project is intended as
open-source toolkit for the Web of Things ecosystem
with modular implementations of the technological building blocks standardized by the W3C. The toolkit may include implementations of the same building block for different platforms, frameworks, or languages. The initial building blocks currently being standardized are:

Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates
Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API
Once these documents reach Candidate Recommendation status, the W3C WoT activity intends to re-charter the WoT Working Group to standardize the next set of building blocks. This is being explored and identified by the WoT Interest Group, which operates in parallel to the Working Group. Thingweb intends to grow with new building blocks being defined in the future. This may include early work by the WoT Interest Group that is not part of the standards track yet.
Furthermore, Thingweb shall include auxiliary tools for the WoT ecosystem such as user interfaces or visualizers for Things, converters to the Thing Description and its serializations, semantic processors around the Thing Description, etc.
Description:
The Eclipse Thingweb project will start with three sub-projects in the toolkit:
Thingweb node-wot
node-wot is the official reference implementation of the W3C WoT Working Group and implements the so-called "Servient Architecture":
node-wot provides a
WoT Thing Description
parser and serializer, several "Protocol Binding" implementing the
WoT Binding Templates
, as well as a runtime system ("WoT Runtime") providing the
WoT Scripting API
for applications. It is based on Node.js and its fundamental module structure.
Thingweb Directory
A Thing Directory is a directory service for WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs) that provides a Web interface to register TDs (aligned with
Eclipse Thingweb | projects.eclipse.org
draft-ietf-core-resource-directory
) and look them up (e.g., using SPARQL queries or CoRE Link Format). The Thingweb Directory implements this service using the
Apache Jena
triple store and SPARQL endpoint.
Thingweb WebUI
Thingweb also intends to provide tooling around the Web of Things ecosystem. The
WebUI
is an
AngularJS
browser app to visualize TDs and enable the interaction with Things from the Web browser.
Why Here?:
While there are already a number of committers for the existing implementations from standardization, the W3C Web of Things will only succeed with a broad acceptance also in the IoT developer community. Eclipse IoT is seen as the best fit, as "Eclipse IoT provides the technology needed to build IoT Devices, Gateways, and Cloud Platforms", and hence is spot on the W3C WoT idea of technological building blocks that span all levels of IoT systems.

[v]
W3C Software Notice and License
Part of Thingweb is used as official reference implementation by the W3C Web of Things Working Group. Thingweb thus needs to be published under the
W3C Software Notice and License
. This license is basically an MIT license that also grants royalty-free usage for any purpose.
Licenses:
Eclipse Public License 2.0
W3C Software Notice and Document License (2015-05-13)
Project Scheduling:
The initial contribution is already available under
https://github.com/thingweb/
.
Assuming the project proposal is accepted, there would be an initial release that implements the status of the W3C "First Public Working Drafts" of the building block specifications mentioned above. For each following W3C "Working Draft" release, there would be another Thingweb release. Note that these will be "0.*" releases.
The 1.0 release of Thingweb is expected with the acceptance of the Working Drafts as W3C "Candidate Recommendation".
After that 1.* releases will follow for bugfixes and adoptions of new features.
Future Work:
The 2.0 release of Eclipse Thingweb is expected after a Working Group re-charter and the next set building blocks reaching W3C "Candidate Recommendation" status.

Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
There is broad agreement about the huge potential for services for the Internet of Things (IoT) across a wide range of application domains, e.g., homes, offices, healthcare, cities, electrical grids, retail, and manufacturing. However, this potential is being held back by fragmentation with a lack of interoperability across platforms, a bewildering variety of standards, and a rapid evolution of the low-level IoT technologies themselves.
The
W3C Web of Things (WoT)
seeks to counter the fragmentation of the IoT by using and extending Web standards (e.g., metadata and APIs) and providing re-usable technological building blocks in order to enable easy integration across IoT platforms and application domains. This is expected to drive down the costs and risks involved in developing services, and help realizing the full potential for the IoT. In short, W3C WoT seeks to extend the Web from a Web of pages to a Web of Things.
The abstract architecture of the Web of Things spans from the device level over edge nodes such as gateways to the cloud. The technological building blocks are intended to be of use at any level and foster a Web-like experience for the Internet of Things. A detailed introduction to the abstract architecture and deployment scenarios, but also use cases and requirements can be found in the
Web of Things (WoT) Architecture
document, a W3C Working Draft.
Scope:
The Eclipse Thingweb project is intended as
open-source toolkit for the Web of Things ecosystem
with modular implementations of the technological building blocks standardized by the W3C. The toolkit may include implementations of the same building block for different platforms, frameworks, or languages. The initial building blocks currently being standardized are:
Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description

Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates
Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API
Once these documents reach Candidate Recommendation status, the W3C WoT activity intends to re-charter the WoT Working Group to standardize the next set of building blocks. This is being explored and identified by the WoT Interest Group, which operates in parallel to the Working Group. Thingweb intends to grow with new building blocks being defined in the future. This may include early work by the WoT Interest Group that is not part of the standards track yet.
Furthermore, Thingweb shall include auxiliary tools for the WoT ecosystem such as user interfaces or visualizers for Things, converters to the Thing Description and its serializations, semantic processors around the Thing Description, etc.
Description:
The Eclipse Thingweb project will start with three sub-projects in the toolkit:
Thingweb node-wot
node-wot is the official reference implementation of the W3C WoT Working Group and implements the so-called "Servient Architecture":
node-wot provides a
WoT Thing Description
parser and serializer, several "Protocol Binding" implementing the
WoT Binding Templates
, as well as a runtime system ("WoT Runtime") providing the
WoT Scripting API
for applications. It is based on Node.js and its fundamental module structure.
Thingweb Directory
A Thing Directory is a directory service for WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs) that provides a Web interface to register TDs (aligned with

) and look them up (e.g., using SPARQL queries or CoRE Link Format). The Thingweb Directory implements this service using the
Apache Jena
triple store and SPARQL endpoint.
Thingweb WebUI
Thingweb also intends to provide tooling around the Web of Things ecosystem. The
WebUI
is an
AngularJS
browser app to visualize TDs and enable the interaction with Things from the Web browser.
Why Here?:
While there are already a number of committers for the existing implementations from standardization, the W3C Web of Things will only succeed with a broad acceptance also in the IoT developer community. Eclipse IoT is seen as the best fit, as "Eclipse IoT provides the technology needed to build IoT Devices, Gateways, and Cloud Platforms", and hence is spot on the W3C WoT idea of technological building blocks that span all levels of IoT systems.

I support this proposal
Submitted by

This set of projects is in support of an important W3C standards initiative for the Internet of Things. The code in questoin is likely to get used in commercial embedded devices and other IoT products, such as gateways, and so it is very important that the code be managed well. Placing these projects under Eclipse will help to provide these assurances.
