The Eclipse Thingweb project currently hosts one sub-project and plans for a second one.
Thingweb node-wot
node-wot is the official reference implementation of the W3C WoT Working Group and implements the so-called "Servient Architecture":
node-wot provides a WoT Thing Description parser and serializer, several "Protocol Bindings" implementing the WoT Binding Templates, as well as a runtime system ("WoT Runtime") providing the WoT Scripting API for applications. It is based on Node.js and its fundamental module structure.
node-wot also provides a browser bundle to visualize TDs and to enable the interaction with Things from the Web browser. A simple example can be found here: WebUI
Thingweb Directory (planned)
A Thing Directory is a directory service for WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs) that provides a Web interface to register TDs (aligned with draft-ietf-core-resource-directory) and look them up (e.g., using SPARQL queries or CoRE Link Format). The Thingweb Directory implements this service using the Apache Jena triple store and SPARQL endpoint.

A Web of Things implementation
Thingweb is an implementation of the WoT Model discussed in the W3C WoT WG. It is simply a toolkit with some demo applications enabling you to create and experiment with WoT applications.
The Web of Things seeks to counter the fragmentation of the IoT through standard complementing building blocks (e.g., metadata and APIs) that enable easy integration across IoT platforms and application domains.
We provide sevices to support exploring W3C WoT

Scope: The Eclipse Thingweb project is intended as an open-source toolkit for the Web of Things ecosystem with modular implementations of the technological building blocks standardized by the W3C. The toolkit may include implementations of the same building block for different platforms, frameworks, or languages. The initial building blocks currently being standardized are:
Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description
Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates
Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API
The first phase of W3C WoT standardization activity already ended and yielded to a recommendation for the Thing Description. The WoT Working Group was re-chartered to standardize the next set of building blocks and to advance the existing ones. The former is being explored and identified by the WoT Interest Group, which operates in parallel to the Working Group. Thingweb intends to grow with new building blocks being defined in the future. This may include early work by the WoT Interest Group that is not part of the standards track yet.
Furthermore, Thingweb shall include auxiliary tools for the WoT ecosystem such as user interfaces or visualizers for Things, converters to the Thing Description and its serializations, semantic processors around the Thing Description, etc.

As a Node.js dependency
You can install node-wot in the following ways:
As a normal dependency (i.e., like loadsh). In this case, you are embedding a servient inside your application.
As a CLI to run scripts. In this case, your application is running inside
the default servient.
Normal Dependency
If you want to use node-wot as a library in your Node.js application, you can use npm to install the node-wot packages that you need. To do so, cd inside you application folder, and run:
npm i @node-wot/core @node-wot/binding-coap --save
Now, you can implement your node-wot entry point, e.g., main.js as follows:
// Required steps to create a servient
const Servient = require('@node-wot/core').Servient
const HttpServer = require('@node-wot/binding-http').HttpServer
const servient = new Servient()
const servient.addServer(new HttpServer(servientConfig.http))
const WoT = await this.servient.start()
//Then from here on use WoT object to consume/produce Things

You can then start the application by running node main.js.
CLI Tool
You can alternatively install the node-wot CLI, either globally (npm i @node-wot/cli -g) or as
a (dev) dependency (npm i @node-wot/cli --save or npm i @node-wot/cli --save-dev).
Then, you don't need to specify any further node-wot dependencies and can implement your application
(e.g., main.js) without explicitly requiring node-wot dependencies:
//No need to require node-wot componets
// WoT runtime is provided as global object
If the CLI is globally installed, you don't need to set up a Node.js project.
If you do so, anyway, you can specify the entry point as follows:
"scripts":{
"start": "wot-servient main.js"
}
There are several ways to start the application:
a. Execute npm start.
b. Execute ./node_modules/.bin/wot-servient main.js.

c. Execute node ./node_modules/@node-wot/cli/dist/cli.js main.js.
d. If you have installed @node-wot/cli globally you can even start the application right
away using this command wot-servient main.js. However, in the current implementation, the
import of local dependencies is not supported in this case.
wot-servient can execute multiple files at once, for example as follows:
wot-servient script1.js ./src/script2.js
Finally, to debug use the option --inspect or --inspect-brk if you want to hang until your debug client is connected. Then start Chrome Dev Tools or vscode debugger or your preferred v8 inspector to debug your code.
For further details check: wot-servient --help

npm install
Use tsc to transcompile TS code to JS in dist directory for each package:
Note: This step automatically calls npm run bootstrap.
npm run build
Optional steps
Link Packages
Make all packages available on your local machine (as symlinks). You can then use each package in its local version via npm link <module> instead of npm install <module> (see also https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link).
sudo npm run link
(On Windows omit sudo)
Link Local wot-typescript-definitions
To evolve the Scripting API in development, you need to use a locally changed version of the wot-typescript-definitions.
Use npm link for this as well:
git clone https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/
cd wot-scripting-api/typescript/
sudo npm link

(On Windows omit sudo)
In each node-wot package, link the local version made available in the previous step:
sudo npm link wot-typescript-definitions
(On Windows omit sudo)
Optimization
To reduce the size of the installation from about 800 MByte down to about 200 MByte, you can run the following commands (currently only tested on Linux):
yarn init
yarn add [packages]
npm run build
lerna init
lerna exec 'npm prune --production'
Trouble shooting
Build error around node-aead-crypto
node-gyp has been seen failing on MacOS
try node 10+, which does not require the crypto polyfill
Build error about No matching version found for @node-wot/... or something about match
try npm run unlock from project root before building

sudo npm run link does not work
try npm run unlock from project root before calling [sudo] npm run link
try npm link in each package directory in this order: td-tools, core, binding-*, cli, demo-servients
Build error around prebuild: npm run bootstrap
This has been seen failing on WSL. Try using Node 12.13.0
As a browser library
Node-wot can also be imported as browser-side library. To do so, include the following script tag in your html:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@node-wot/browser-bundle@latest/dist/wot-bundle.min.js"></script>
In the browser, node wot only works in client mode with limited binding support. Supported bindings: HTTP / HTTPS / WebSockets
var servient = new Wot.Core.Servient();
var client = new Wot.Http.HttpClient();
No time for explanations - show me a running example!
Using Node.js
Run all the steps above including "Link Packages" and then run this:
wot-servient -h
cd examples/scripts

wot-servient
Without the "Link Packages" step, the wot-servient command is not available and node needs to be used (e.g., Windows CMD shell):
# expose
node packages\cli\dist\cli.js examples\scripts\counter.js
# consume
node packages\cli\dist\cli.js --clientonly examples\scripts\counter-client.js
Go to http://localhost:8080/counter and you'll find a thing description
Query the count by http://localhost:8080/counter/properties/count
Modify the count via POST on http://localhost:8080/counter/actions/increment and http://localhost:8080/counter/actions/decrement
Application logic is in examples/scripts/counter.js

Using a browser
An example of how to use node-wot as a browser-side library can be found under examples/browser/index.html.
To run it, open examples/browser/index.html in a modern browser, and consume the test Thing available under http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8083/testthing to interact with it.
The JavaScript code that uses node-wot as a library to power this application can be found under: examples/browser/index.js
How to use the library
The API
This library implements the WoT Scripting API:
Editors Draft in master
Working Draft corresponding to node-wot release versions
You can also see examples/scripts to have a feeling of how to script a Thing.
Logging
We used to have a node-wot-logger package to allow fine-grained logging (by means of Winston). It turned out though that depending on the actual use-case other logging libraries might be better suited. Hence we do not want to prescribe which logging library to use. Having said that, we use console statements which can be easily overriden to use the prefered logging library if needed (see here).
The logs in the library follows those best practice rules (see here):
Tag log messages with the package as following: console.debug("[package-name]", "log message). This is useful to identify which package generated the log.
Avoid to use info and log in packages other than the cli package.
Please follows these rules if you are going to contribute to node-wot library.

Install new/different versions of NodeJS
Using NPM, you can install NodeJS independent from the usually outdated package managers such as apt. This is nicely done by n:
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
To get the "stable" version:
sudo n stable
To get the "latest" version:
sudo n latest
Finally, make the node command available through:
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/n/versions/node/<VERSION>/bin/node /usr/bin/node

Creation Review
Eclipse Thingweb Creation Review
Type: CreationState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, February 7, 2018Project: Eclipse ThingwebProposal:
Eclipse Thingweb
Parent Project: Eclipse IoTBackground: There is broad agreement about the huge potential for services for the Internet of Things (IoT) across a wide range of application domains, e.g., homes, offices, healthcare, cities, electrical grids, retail, and manufacturing. However, this potential is being held back by fragmentation with a lack of interoperability across platforms, a bewildering variety of standards, and a rapid evolution of the low-level IoT technologies themselves.
The W3C Web of Things (WoT) seeks to counter the fragmentation of the IoT by using and extending Web standards (e.g., metadata and APIs) and providing re-usable technological building blocks in order to enable easy integration across IoT platforms and application domains. This is expected to drive down the costs and risks involved in developing services, and help realizing the full potential for the IoT. In short, W3C WoT seeks to extend the Web from a Web of pages to a Web of Things.
The abstract architecture of the Web of Things spans from the device level over edge nodes such as gateways to the cloud. The technological building blocks are intended to be of use at any level and foster a Web-like experience for the Internet of Things. A detailed introduction to the abstract architecture and deployment scenarios, but also use cases and requirements can be found in the Web of Things (WoT) Architecture document, a W3C Working Draft.
Scope: The Eclipse Thingweb project is intended as open-source toolkit for the Web of Things ecosystem with modular implementations of the technological building blocks standardized by the W3C. The toolkit may include implementations of the same building block for different platforms, frameworks, or languages. The initial building blocks currently being standardized are:
Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description
Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates
Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API
Once these documents reach Candidate Recommendation status, the W3C WoT activity intends to re-charter the WoT Working Group to standardize the next set of building blocks. This is being explored and identified by the WoT Interest Group, which operates in parallel to the Working Group. Thingweb intends to grow with new building blocks being defined in the future. This may include early work by the WoT Interest Group that is not part of the standards track yet.
Furthermore, Thingweb shall include auxiliary tools for the WoT ecosystem such as user interfaces or visualizers for Things, converters to the Thing Description and its serializations, semantic processors around the Thing Description, etc.
Description: The Eclipse Thingweb project will start with three sub-projects in the toolkit:
Thingweb node-wot

README.md
thingweb-directory
The Thingweb Directory is an open source directory for Thing Descriptions. The Thing Description (TD) model is a recommendation of the W3C Web of Things working group to describe Things.
Searching for a Thing based on its metadata, properties, actions or events;
Creating a new Thing's TD or updating an existing one;
Deleting a Thing's TD;
CRUD operations are supported either over HTTP or CoAP;
Generating a servient based on a discovered Thing.
Structure of the repository
Getting Started
The Thingweb Directory requires Java 1.8.

Merge pull request #335 from danielpeintner/issue-333
Sep 29, 2020
node-wot is the official reference implementation of the W3C WoT Working Group and implements the so-called "Servient Architecture":
node-wot provides a WoT Thing Description parser and serializer, several "Protocol Binding" implementing the WoT Binding Templates, as well as a runtime system ("WoT Runtime") providing the WoT Scripting API for applications. It is based on Node.js and its fundamental module structure.
Thingweb Directory
A Thing Directory is a directory service for WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs) that provides a Web interface to register TDs (aligned with draft-ietf-core-resource-directory) and look them up (e.g., using SPARQL queries or CoRE Link Format). The Thingweb Directory implements this service using the Apache Jena triple store and SPARQL endpoint.
Thingweb WebUI
Thingweb also intends to provide tooling around the Web of Things ecosystem. The WebUI is an AngularJS browser app to visualize TDs and enable the interaction with Things from the Web browser.
Why Here?: While there are already a number of committers for the existing implementations from standardization, the W3C Web of Things will only succeed with a broad acceptance also in the IoT developer community. Eclipse IoT is seen as the best fit, as "Eclipse IoT provides the technology needed to build IoT Devices, Gateways, and Cloud Platforms", and hence is spot on the W3C WoT idea of technological building blocks that span all levels of IoT systems.

Dependencies:
Node.js (MIT)
NPM modules (all MIT)
Thingweb Directory
License: MIT (to be changed to W3C)
Language: Java
$ bin/directory-app
After this step, the Directory server is running and can be accessed over HTTP at: http://localhost:8080.
Run the command above with arg -h for more details.
By default, the Directory runs an in-memory RDF store, whose content is deleted after the Directory is shut down.
Known issues
On Windows, the execution will fail with a Batch error message. If Mingw is installed on your machine, try to run bin/thingweb-directory inside an emulated Bash shell. Alternatively, try java -cp lib\* org.eclipse.thingweb.directory.app.Main.
Interacting with the Directory
The HTTP endpoint provides an HTML client to register and discover Thing Descriptions. This client accesses a REST API to manage Thing Descriptions that complies to the IETF Resource Directory specification.
Registration is done by POSTing on /td and discovery can be performed on the following resources:
td-lookup/ep,
td-lookup/res,
td-lookup/sem (which expects a SPARQL graph pattern as query parameter) and
td-lookup/frame (which expects a JSON-LD 1.0 frame object).
See directory-servlet/src/main/webapp/api.json for a formal specification of the Thing Directory API. This file is exposed by the server at /api.json. It can e.g. be processed by the Swagger UI to render an online documentation. See the Open API Initiative for more details.
Building from sources
We are using Gradle as a build tool.
The following command will produce a distribution of the Thingweb Directory in directory-app/build/distributions/:

Eclipse Thingweb
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse IoT
Background: There is broad agreement about the huge potential for services for the Internet of Things (IoT) across a wide range of application domains, e.g., homes, offices, healthcare, cities, electrical grids, retail, and manufacturing. However, this potential is being held back by fragmentation with a lack of interoperability across platforms, a bewildering variety of standards, and a rapid evolution of the low-level IoT technologies themselves.
The W3C Web of Things (WoT) seeks to counter the fragmentation of the IoT by using and extending Web standards (e.g., metadata and APIs) and providing re-usable technological building blocks in order to enable easy integration across IoT platforms and application domains. This is expected to drive down the costs and risks involved in developing services, and help realizing the full potential for the IoT. In short, W3C WoT seeks to extend the Web from a Web of pages to a Web of Things.
The abstract architecture of the Web of Things spans from the device level over edge nodes such as gateways to the cloud. The technological building blocks are intended to be of use at any level and foster a Web-like experience for the Internet of Things. A detailed introduction to the abstract architecture and deployment scenarios, but also use cases and requirements can be found in the Web of Things (WoT) Architecture document, a W3C Working Draft.
Scope: The Eclipse Thingweb project is intended as open-source toolkit for the Web of Things ecosystem with modular implementations of the technological building blocks standardized by the W3C. The toolkit may include implementations of the same building block for different platforms, frameworks, or languages. The initial building blocks currently being standardized are:
Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description
Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates
Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API
Once these documents reach Candidate Recommendation status, the W3C WoT activity intends to re-charter the WoT Working Group to standardize the next set of building blocks. This is being explored and identified by the WoT Interest Group, which operates in parallel to the Working Group. Thingweb intends to grow with new building blocks being defined in the future. This may include early work by the WoT Interest Group that is not part of the standards track yet.
npm install -g --production windows-build-tools
WSL: Windows Services for Linux should follow Linux instructions.
Mac OS
Meet the node-gyp requirements:
xcode-select --install
To use in a browser
To use node-wot as a browser-side JavaScript Library, the browser needs to support ECMAScript 2015.
Supported browsers include:
Microsoft Edge 15 and later
Firefox 54 and later
Chrome 58 and later
Safari 10 and later
Using a browser with only ES5 support (eg. IE 11) might be possible if you add polyfills.
How to get the library
As a Node.js dependency
You can install node-wot in the following ways:
As a normal dependency (i.e., like loadsh). In this case, you are embedding a servient inside your application.
Furthermore, Thingweb shall include auxiliary tools for the WoT ecosystem such as user interfaces or visualizers for Things, converters to the Thing Description and its serializations, semantic processors around the Thing Description, etc.
Description: The Eclipse Thingweb project will start with three sub-projects in the toolkit:
Thingweb node-wot
node-wot is the official reference implementation of the W3C WoT Working Group and implements the so-called "Servient Architecture":
node-wot provides a WoT Thing Description parser and serializer, several "Protocol Binding" implementing the WoT Binding Templates, as well as a runtime system ("WoT Runtime") providing the WoT Scripting API for applications. It is based on Node.js and its fundamental module structure.
Thingweb Directory
A Thing Directory is a directory service for WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs) that provides a Web interface to register TDs (aligned with draft-ietf-core-resource-directory) and look them up (e.g., using SPARQL queries or CoRE Link Format). The Thingweb Directory implements this service using the Apache Jena triple store and SPARQL endpoint.
Thingweb WebUI
Thingweb also intends to provide tooling around the Web of Things ecosystem. The WebUI is an AngularJS browser app to visualize TDs and enable the interaction with Things from the Web browser.
Why Here?: While there are already a number of committers for the existing implementations from standardization, the W3C Web of Things will only succeed with a broad acceptance also in the IoT developer community. Eclipse IoT is seen as the best fit, as "Eclipse IoT provides the technology needed to build IoT Devices, Gateways, and Cloud Platforms", and hence is spot on the W3C WoT idea of technological building blocks that span all levels of IoT systems.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 2.0W3C Software Notice and Document License (2015-05-13)Legal Issues: FORM DOES NOT ALLOW TO SELECT NONE OF THE LISTED LICENSES -- MIT DOES NOT APPLY

Part of Thingweb is used as official reference implementation by the W3C Web of Things Working Group. Thingweb thus needs to be published under the W3C Software Notice and License. This license is basically an MIT license that also grants royalty-free usage for any purpose.
As a CLI to run scripts. In this case, your application is running inside
the default servient.
Normal Dependency
If you want to use node-wot as a library in your Node.js application, you can use npm to install the node-wot packages that you need. To do so, cd inside you application folder, and run:
npm i @node-wot/core @node-wot/binding-coap --save
Now, you can implement your node-wot entry point, e.g., main.js as follows:
// Required steps to create a servient
const Servient = require('@node-wot/core').Servient
const HttpServer = require('@node-wot/binding-http').HttpServer
const servient = new Servient()
const servient.addServer(new HttpServer(servientConfig.http))
const WoT = await this.servient.start()
//Then from here on use WoT object to consume/produce Things
You can then start the application by running node main.js.
CLI Tool
You can alternatively install the node-wot CLI, either globally (npm i @node-wot/cli -g) or as
a (dev) dependency (npm i @node-wot/cli --save or npm i @node-wot/cli --save-dev).
Project Scheduling: The initial contribution is already available under https://github.com/thingweb/.
Assuming the project proposal is accepted, there would be an initial release that implements the status of the W3C "First Public Working Drafts" of the building block specifications mentioned above. For each following W3C "Working Draft" release, there would be another Thingweb release. Note that these will be "0.*" releases.
The 1.0 release of Thingweb is expected with the acceptance of the Working Drafts as W3C "Candidate Recommendation".
After that 1.* releases will follow for bugfixes and adoptions of new features.

Then, you don't need to specify any further node-wot dependencies and can implement your application
(e.g., main.js) without explicitly requiring node-wot dependencies:
//No need to require node-wot componets
// WoT runtime is provided as global object
If the CLI is globally installed, you don't need to set up a Node.js project.
If you do so, anyway, you can specify the entry point as follows:
"scripts":{
"start": "wot-servient main.js"
}
There are several ways to start the application:
a. Execute npm start.
b. Execute ./node_modules/.bin/wot-servient main.js.
c. Execute node ./node_modules/@node-wot/cli/dist/cli.js main.js.
d. If you have installed @node-wot/cli globally you can even start the application right
away using this command wot-servient main.js. However, in the current implementation, the
import of local dependencies is not supported in this case.
wot-servient can execute multiple files at once, for example as follows:

As a standalone application
Clone and build
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot
Go into the repository:
cd thingweb.node-wot
Install root dependencies (locally installs tools such as typescript and lerna):
npm install
Use tsc to transcompile TS code to JS in dist directory for each package:
Note: This step automatically calls npm run bootstrap.
npm run build
Optional steps
Link Packages
Make all packages available on your local machine (as symlinks). You can then use each package in its local version via npm link <module> instead of npm install <module> (see also https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link).

I support this proposal
Submitted by Michael McCool on Mon, 2017-10-30 00:36
This set of projects is in support of an important W3C standards initiative for the Internet of Things. The code in questoin is likely to get used in commercial embedded devices and other IoT products, such as gateways, and so it is very important that the code be managed well. Placing these projects under Eclipse will help to provide these assurances.

sudo npm run link
(On Windows omit sudo)
Link Local wot-typescript-definitions
To evolve the Scripting API in development, you need to use a locally changed version of the wot-typescript-definitions.
Use npm link for this as well:
git clone https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/
cd wot-scripting-api/typescript/
sudo npm link
(On Windows omit sudo)
In each node-wot package, link the local version made available in the previous step:
sudo npm link wot-typescript-definitions
(On Windows omit sudo)
Optimization
To reduce the size of the installation from about 800 MByte down to about 200 MByte, you can run the following commands (currently only tested on Linux):
yarn init
yarn add [packages]
npm run build

Trouble shooting
Build error around node-aead-crypto
node-gyp has been seen failing on MacOS
try node 10+, which does not require the crypto polyfill
Build error about No matching version found for @node-wot/... or something about match
try npm run unlock from project root before building
sudo npm run link does not work
try npm run unlock from project root before calling [sudo] npm run link
try npm link in each package directory in this order: td-tools, core, binding-*, cli, demo-servients
Build error around prebuild: npm run bootstrap
This has been seen failing on WSL. Try using Node 12.13.0
As a browser library
Node-wot can also be imported as browser-side library. To do so, include the following script tag in your html:
Back to the top
Daniel Peintner is a Project Lead for Eclipse Thingweb | projects.eclipse.org
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@node-wot/browser-bundle@latest/dist/wot-bundle.min.js"></script>
In the browser, node wot only works in client mode with limited binding support. Supported bindings: HTTP / HTTPS / WebSockets
var servient = new Wot.Core.Servient();
var client = new Wot.Http.HttpClient();
No time for explanations - show me a running example!
Using Node.js
Run all the steps above including "Link Packages" and then run this:
wot-servient -h
cd examples/scripts
wot-servient
Without the "Link Packages" step, the wot-servient command is not available and node needs to be used (e.g., Windows CMD shell):
# expose
node packages\cli\dist\cli.js examples\scripts\counter.js
# consume
node packages\cli\dist\cli.js --clientonly examples\scripts\counter-client.js

Go to http://localhost:8080/counter and you'll find a thing description
Query the count by http://localhost:8080/counter/properties/count
Modify the count via POST on http://localhost:8080/counter/actions/increment and http://localhost:8080/counter/actions/decrement
Application logic is in examples/scripts/counter.js
Using a browser
An example of how to use node-wot as a browser-side library can be found under examples/browser/index.html.
To run it, open examples/browser/index.html in a modern browser, and consume the test Thing available under http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8083/testthing to interact with it.
The JavaScript code that uses node-wot as a library to power this application can be found under: examples/browser/index.js
How to use the library
The API
This library implements the WoT Scripting API:
Editors Draft in master
Working Draft corresponding to node-wot release versions
You can also see examples/scripts to have a feeling of how to script a Thing.
Logging
We used to have a node-wot-logger package to allow fine-grained logging (by means of Winston). It turned out though that depending on the actual use-case other logging libraries might be better suited. Hence we do not want to prescribe which logging library to use. Having said that, we use console statements which can be easily overriden to use the prefered logging library if needed (see here).
The logs in the library follows those best practice rules (see here):

Tag log messages with the package as following: console.debug("[package-name]", "log message). This is useful to identify which package generated the log.
Avoid to use info and log in packages other than the cli package.
Please follows these rules if you are going to contribute to node-wot library.
Install new/different versions of NodeJS
Using NPM, you can install NodeJS independent from the usually outdated package managers such as apt. This is nicely done by n:
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
To get the "stable" version:
sudo n stable
To get the "latest" version:
sudo n latest
Finally, make the node command available through:
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/n/versions/node/<VERSION>/bin/node /usr/bin/node
