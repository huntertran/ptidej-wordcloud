Whiskers is an
OGC SensorThings API
framework consisting of a JavaScript client and a light-weight server for IoT gateways (e.g., Raspberry Pi). The SensorThings API is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard that allows IoT (Internet of Things) devices and their data to be connected; a major goal is to foster a healthy and open IoT ecosystem, as opposed to one dominated by proprietary information silos.
JavaScript is ubiquitous, powering client-side web applications and server-side services alike. The availability of an open source client library is an important step in the adoption of the OGC SensorThings standard, as it makes development quicker and easier.
In addition the a client library, Whiskers will also have a SensorThings server module for IoT gateways, such as Raspberry Pi. Developers will be able to deploy and configure IoT gateways, make them SensorThings API-compliant, and connect with spatial data servers around the world that implement the full array of
OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards
.
Whiskers aims to make SensorThings development easy for the large and growing world of IoT developers.

Project:
Eclipse Whiskers
Proposal:
Whiskers
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
The Internet of Things (IoT) needs no introduction: it is a widely-held view that billions of devices will be part of the Internet of Things in just a few short years. Yet, while this explosion of devices represents boundless opportunity for innovation, this ascendancy also presents daunting challenges such as fragmentation, vendor lock-in and the proliferation of information silos. The OGC (
Open Geospatial Consortium
)
SensorThings API
is an OGC standard that allows IoT devices and their data to be connected in an easy-to-use and open way. The wide adoption of the SensorThings API would contribute to an IoT ecosystem that is healthy and interconnected, rather than one that is proprietary, incompatible and fragmented.
Scope:
Whiskers is an OGC SensorThings API framework consisting of a JavaScript client and a light-weight server for IoT gateways. As the OGC SensorThings API standard specification continues to evolve, Whiskers will evolve with it.
Description:
Whiskers is an
OGC SensorThings API
framework consisting of a JavaScript client and a light-weight server for IoT gateways (e.g., Raspberry Pi). The SensorThings API is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard that allows IoT (Internet of Things) devices and their data to be connected; a major goal is to foster a healthy and open IoT ecosystem, as opposed to one dominated by proprietary information silos.
JavaScript is ubiquitous, powering client-side web applications and server-side services alike. The availability of an open source client library is an important step in the adoption of the OGC SensorThings standard, as it makes development quicker and easier.
In addition the a client library, Whiskers will also have a SensorThings server module for IoT gateways, such as Raspberry Pi. Developers will be able to deploy and configure IoT gateways, make them SensorThings API-compliant, and connect with spatial data servers around the world that implement the full array of
OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards
.
Whiskers aims to make SensorThings development easy for the large and growing world of IoT developers.
Why Here?:
The Eclipse Foundation is home to a large and growing number of IoT and geospatial projects (e.g., LocationTech), and is widely recognized for its good governance. Being a part of the Eclipse Community will bring Whiskers visibility, credibility and access to some of the most experienced minds in the open source world.
Initial Contribution:
There will be no initial contribution. The project will start from scratch. We expect to use some existing Eclipse IoT libraries, such as Paho, Californium, and Kura.
Legal Issues:
We are not aware of any legal issues. Whiskers will be an implementation of an OGC standard. There is no legal issues for the API. We are starting the code base from scratch, so there will be no potential source code license issues.
Licenses:
Eclipse Distribution License 1.0 (BSD)
Eclipse Public License 1.0
Project Scheduling:
Whiskers aims to have an initial contribution ready by the end of Q2 2016.
Future Work:
Going forward, Whiskers will evolve along with the SensorThings API standard specification. The Sensing Profile of SensorThings (Part I) has been developed, and the Tasking Profile (Part II) is expected to be available in the upcoming months. The SensorThings Rules Engine (Part III) is also under development within OGC.

Without any code and without being an emanation of an existing Eclipse projet it's hard to evaluate the viability of this project.
You have some code available somewhere?
