Overview
This application illustrates how to send data to a Google Cloud IoT platform from a Legato
application running on a AirPrime WP module on mangOH Green or mangOH Red open source
hardware platforms.
The tutorial details the source files of the Legato application and shows how to build, install and
run the Legato application that sends mangOH native sensor data [ temperature + gyroscope ] to
the cloud using MQTT protocol through Google Cloud IoT platform.
We'll build, install and run the application with the open source Linux-based embedded platform
Legato toolchain and installation command line.
You must first install and run the utils-legato-mqtt application available
here which is the MQTT client
allowing our device to cloud application (MQTT publisher) to communicate.

Overview
This application illustrates how to send data to a Google Cloud IoT platform from a Legato
application running on a AirPrime WP module on mangOH Green or mangOH Red open source
hardware platforms.
The tutorial details the source files of the Legato application and shows how to build, install and
run the Legato application that sends mangOH native sensor data [ temperature + gyroscope ] to
the cloud using MQTT protocol through Google Cloud IoT platform.
We'll build, install and run the application with the open source Linux-based embedded platform
Legato toolchain and installation command line.
You must first install and run the utils-legato-mqtt application available
here which is the MQTT client
allowing our device to cloud application (MQTT publisher) to communicate.

What Our Customers Are Saying
Don’t just take it from us, let our customers do the talking!
Without the mangOH Green and Legato application framework the rapid development cycle would not have been possible. The learning curve is exceptionally short. I would highly recommend this platform for use in commercial projects.
Siska Burger
General Manager, Comb Communications
The powerful and feature-rich hardware platform is complemented with an equally impressive software platform, and backed by a knowledgeable and steadily growing community.
Raffaele Lacobelli
MEA
mangOH + Legato proves that Smart sensors to advanced IOT implementation can be simple, secure, and cost effective so we can’t contemplate our new telematics gateway without this.
