Google Cloud IoT Core on ESPRESSObin
Introduction
Google Cloud Platform (read more), offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that run on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.
One of the services that Google also provides on its Google Cloud Platform and that is used in this tutorial is called Cloud IoT Core (read more). Cloud IoT Core is a fully managed service that allows you to easily and securely connect, manage, and ingest data from millions of globally dispersed devices. Cloud IoT Core, in combination with other services on Google Cloud IoT platform, provides a complete solution for collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing IoT data in real time to support improved operational efficiency. Cloud IoT Core service is fully supported on ESPRESSObin board.
Cloud IoT Core
In order for ESPRESSObin to connect and communicate with the Cloud IoT Core service, the following steps need to be completed:
Setting up a working Ubuntu filesystem flashed on ESPRESSObin (as shown in Boot from removable storage - Ubuntu).
Obtaining permission access to Cloud IoT Core service. At the time of writing this tutorial, Cloud IoT Core service is in a public beta state and an application form needs to be filed out to apply for access to the public beta. Getting and setting up the Cloud IoT Core is out of the scope of this tutorial. To obtain the access, click here from where you will be able to access the application form. When access to Cloud IoT Core is granted, please follow the official Cloud IoT Core documentation available here to set up your project and devices. This is needed in order to be able to connect to the Cloud IoT Core using ESPRESSObin.
MQTT Client
Now that we have ESPRESSObin with Ubuntu file system and access to Cloud IoT Core with a configured project, the final component is setting up the application that will be run on the ESPRESSObin. This application is called google-iot-mqtt-publisher, a MQTT client which is used to publish messages to a specific topic on Google Cloud IoT.
In order to use the google-iot-mqtt-publisher, we need to build it out from source code. The google-iot-mqtt-publisher is written in Go programming language, to build it, you need to have a working Go installation. Since the board is running Ubuntu, the recommended way is to install Go onto the board itself using a package manager. Alternative is to follow the official Go instalation instruction. It is also possible to build google-iot-mqtt-publisher on a different Linux machine. Doing this, google-iot-mqtt-publisher needs to be cross-compiled for MACCHIATObin. This is out of scope of this tutorial. Instructions for installing Go onto the board itself using a package manager can be found below.
Installing Go
Run the commands listed below to install Go onto the board itself using a package manager:
First, update the package list:
# apt-get update
Then, install Git and Go:
# apt-get install git golang-go
Configuring Go
Next thing we need to do is set correct Go paths. As root open .profile config file:
# sudo vim ~/.profile
and in there set Go's root value ($HOME/go will be our Go workspace directory):
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
and refresh your profile with:
# source ~/.profile
Make the directory for your Go workspace as you have set it in your .profile:
# mkdir $HOME/go
This is where Go will build its files.
Build Instructions
After Go is installed on your local machine, we can move to building the google-iot-mqtt-publisher.
Create a directory which will hold the contents of the google-iot-mqtt-publisher:
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/google-iot-mqtt-publisher-marvell
Get the google-iot-mqtt-publisher source code via Git or by downloading the ZIP archive containing the source code from here and put the source into the $GOPATH/src/github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/google-iot-mqtt-publisher-marvell folder.
Finally, position yourself in the $GOPATH/src/github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/google-iot-mqtt-publisher-marvell directory and fetch third party libraries:
$ go get
after which we can cross-compile for arm64:
$ go build -o google-iot-mqtt-publisher
This will generate an executable with the file name of google-iot-mqtt-publisher in the same directory. In order to run the executable on the ESPRESSObin, the certs/ directory must also be installed. The certs directory contains three files:
roots.pem - A root certificate from Google that must be installed alongside the google-iot-mqtt-publisher executable.
rsa_cert.pem - Self-signed public key that is used by Cloud IoT Core.
rsa_private.pem - Self-signed private key used by google-iot-mqtt-publisher to authenticate your device to Cloud IoT Core.
The keys mentioned here are merely an example. Make sure to use your own self-signed keys for your device. Device authentication must be configured in Cloud IoT Core prior to using google-iot-mqtt-publisher.
× NoteYou must replace the private key with your own key used during device authentication configuration in Cloud IoT Core. Otherwise, the google-iot-mqtt-publisher will not be able to authenticate your device during initial connection to the Cloud IoT Core service.
That's it. You have successfully built the google-iot-mqtt-publisher which is ready for usage.
google-iot-mqtt-publisher usage
Obtain google-iot-mqtt-publisher help page with:
$ ./google-iot-mqtt-publisher --help
google-iot-mqtt-publisher is a MQTT client used to publish messages to a specific topic on Google Cloud IoT.
Usage:
google-iot-mqtt-publisher [flags]
Flags:
-d, --device-id string Device ID
-m, --message string A string which will be sent to a topic.
-p, --project-id string Project ID
-r, --registry-id string Registry ID
-t, --topic string A topic to which the message will be sent.
Example
To publish a message, run the google-iot-mqtt-publisher tool with the correct values for flags, for example:
$ ./google-iot-mqtt-publisher --project-id "example-project" --registry-id "example-registry" --device-id "example-device" --topic "events" --message "example-message-containing-telemetry-data"
Make sure to replace the above values with your own.
To fetch the published message, you can use the gcloud available from Google Cloud SDK. Follow the Google IoT Cloud Core How-to Guide to install gcloud locally on your Linux machine. After you have installed gcloud, run the following command to fetch the published message (again, replace example values with your own):
$ gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions pull --auto-ack projects/example-project/subscriptions/example-subscription
If everything went well, you have successfully sent a MQTT message from your ESPRESSObin to Cloud IoT Core service and were able to fetch this message locally on your Linux machine using the gcloud. Above instructions can also be seen in an asciinema video here.

Running Open Source Software on ESPRESSObin
By akrog on 04/04/17
The Marvell ESPRESSObin board project, launched by Globalscale Technologies on Kickstarter at the beginning of October this year, is a single board computing platform which places emphasis on networking, storage and wireless connectivity. The board is powered by Marvell’s ARMADA 3700 dual-core processor clocking up to 1.2 GHz. Other specs include:
1x Topaz Networking Switch
1x uSD card slot with footprint for an optional 4GB EMMC
1GB DDR3 & 2GB DDR3 options
2x Gb Ethernet LAN
1x Ethernet WAN
1x SATA interface for HDD storage
1x USB 3.0 and 1x USB 2.0
1x MiniPCIe for Wireless/BLE peripherals
2x Row of GPIO headers for accessories and shields
All of ESPRESSObin’s software is Open Source, and users have a choice of compiling system components themselves or downloading pre-compiled binaries. Considering supported file systems, currently users can boot Buildroot, Ubuntu and Yocto on their boards, with support soon to be added for OpenWrt, Debian
and Archlinux ARM.
In line with an Open Source approach, the ESPRESSObin board is perfectly suited for running Open Source Software. So far, the ESPRESSObin wiki features tutorials for libyang – a popular YANG data modelling language parser and toolkit written in C (used in projects such as libnetconf2, Netopeer2 or Sysrepo), MySQL – a renowned, fast, multi-user and multi-threaded SQL database server and OpenSSL – a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols.. Additional Open Source Software tutorials are in the making at the time of writing this blog post.
Furthermore, the OpenSSL tutorial also features a speed test in order to demonstrate how well ESPRESSObin, or to put it differently, how well its 64bit Dual Core ARM53 Armada 3700 SoC (clocking up to 1.2 GHz) fares with executing machine code.

ESPRESSObin Kickstarter campaign
By Maxim on 12/01/16
Kickstarter campaign for Marvell ESPRESSObin board by Globalscale was launched in October 2016 aiming to fund the development of a Marvell ARM 64-bit SoC: the Armada 3700. The ESPRESSObin Board is a low-cost, high-performance 64-bit dual core networking computing platform aimed at a variety of use cases and applications, the focus being placed on networking, storage and connectivity space.
More precisely, the project launched on October 2nd and reached its set goal of $15,000 in just four days on October 6th. The campaign was completed at November 11th, collecting around $53,339 (356% more than the set funding goal) and with 536 backers. Average pledge size revolved around $99 and the project ended with an average of 13 daily backers. The first stretch goal announced at October 28th including an upgraded Wi-Fi & Bluetooth card for all backers pledging more than $69 was also met, so these backers received an upgrade from the standard Realtek-based 802.11N radio to a modern 802.11ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with 4.x Bluetooth. The second stretch goal required over 100K in pledges and would include an enclosure for an ESPRESSObin case, but that goal was not met.
Along with volume discounts, the ESPRESSObin package price ranged from $39, $49, $69 and $79 where $39 early bird packages start with delivery in January 2017. The $79 Super ESPRESSObin board package was the most wanted package receiving over 133 backers.
The campaign was a continuation on past successful collaborations between Marvell and Globalscale, including products such as the Armada 370-based GT1MiraBox, Kirkwood-based SheevaPlug, DreamPlug and others.
Since the ESPRESSObin marked the first Armada 3700 based SoC marketed under $50, the board ignited a lot of interest from the community both due to price and specifications. With the lack of software support after shipment often being an issue with Kickstarter projects of such nature, most pledgers were also happy to see ESPRESSObin offering open source Linux software with mainline Kernel support. The board ships with Buildroot as default root file system, although support has been added for OpenWrt, and further plans include adding support for ArchLinux ARM and Debian. All documentation regarding the board is open with software soon to be available on GitHub (find out more here).

ESPRESSObin in mainline Linux
By meitalbin on 01/10/17
What does mainline imply? It means that a supported platform, or in ESPRESSObin’s case the Armada 3700 dual-core SoC, can be booted directly, that is, without requiring any additional patches.
This state is achieved through several irrefutable qualities of a platform being supported in mainline by the Linux kernel, most notably the quality, scalability and reduced time-to-market which the mainline brings to the table.
The scalability aspect of mainline implies that any potential changes to the kernel version will not affect currently available features and they will migrate seamlessly between kernel versions. Therefore, the core on which the board’s features are based on will not require any changes, meaning that focus can be then placed on the development of features which differentiate ESPRESSObin from the competition and satisfy requests from the user community.
Furthermore, mainline support also implies that ESPRESSObin users will benefit from new features and bug fixes which will be present in newer kernel versions, thereby keeping them equipped with the latest stable, robust and high-quality operating system environment.
Incorporating a stable kernel release in ESPRESSObin minimizes the duration of life cycle stagnation points spent on tracking and implementing kernel updates, maintaining and supporting code patches, stress testing newly added kernel aspects and various other time-consuming activities.
Avoidance of these constraints also implies reduction of migration costs as well as quicker market releases. In other words, more time will be spent on bringing new features to ESPRESSObin users all the while enabling them to take full advantage of newer kernel editions.
ESPRESSObin support is merged in Linux mainline part of kernel v4.11
Firmware releases are available for Ubuntu, and support for ArchLinux ARM, Debian, Yocto and OpenWrt will be added soon as well.

ESPRESSObin-powered circuit drawing with Fritzing
By akrog on 03/28/17
The ESPRESSObin team designed ESPRESSObin SBC part which can be easily imported into Fritzing, a popular, open source Electronic Design Automation software for everyone interested in physical computing and prototyping. ESPRESSObin users can now draw ESPRESSObin-powered circuits in a drag-n-drop way and share their designs with other users. Below you can see an example drawing with the ESPRESSObin board made in Fritzing:
For now, the ESPRESSObin part is only available in the form of an .FZPZ file, a standard .ZIP file generated by Fritzing. The .FZPZ file contains all ESPRESSObin SVG images and FPZ part file and can be opened like any other .ZIP archive. You can download the .ZIP archive containing the .FZPZ file from here:
ESPRESSObin_Fritzing_fzpz
After downloading and extracting, simply import the .FZPZ into Fritzing by clicking File -> Open and selecting the ESPRESSObin.fzpz file. You can then right-click on the board in breadboard view and select Add to bin -> My Parts after which ESPRESSObin will be stored in your personal bin for future uses. The part is only made for educational purposes and we do not guarantee its correctness.

The Armada 88F3700 is a very powerful processor which clocks up to 1.2GHz.
Why is core CPU limit set to 1GHz?
The Armada 88F3700 currently supports 1GHz CPU clock speed. Support for 1.2GHz will be ready soon.
Does it overclock?
No, 1.2GHz is the maximum supported frequency.
Does it need a heatsink?
The processor does not need heatsink because it has a very low power dissipation.
What is its operating temperature?
0-70 Celsius ambient temperature.
Can I add extra memory?
Regarding system memory the ESPRESSObin board comes in fixed 1 GB DDR3 and 2 GB DDR3 flavors. Extra storage capacity can be added via various supported peripherals (SATA, microSD card, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0).
What hardware interfaces does it have?
Switch, miniPCIe, SATA, USB2.0, USB3.0 and SD card.
