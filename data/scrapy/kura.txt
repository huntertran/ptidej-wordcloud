The extensible open source Java/OSGi IoT Edge Framework
Eclipse Kura™ is an extensible open source IoT Edge Framework based on Java/OSGi. Kura offers API access to the hardware interfaces of IoT Gateways (serial ports, GPS, watchdog, GPIOs, I2C, etc.). It features ready-to-use field protocols (including Modbus, OPC-UA, S7), an application container, and a web-based visual data flow programming to acquire data from the field, process it at the edge, and publish it to leading IoT Cloud Platforms through MQTT connectivity.

Eclipse Kura - 4.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download and install Java SE from
Java SE Downloads
. Use the latest version of Java SE Development Kit and download the version appropriate for your system.
For additional information regarding the installation of Java 8 on all supported operating systems, see
JDK 8 and JRE 8 Installation Guide
.
Eclipse IDE
The Eclipse IDE is an open source development tool that consists of an integrated development environment (IDE) and a plug-in system for managing extensions.
For automated installation see
Oomph installer
below.
Installing Eclipse
Before installing Eclipse, you should choose directory locations for the Eclipse install and its workspaces.
Note:
The following points should be kept in mind regarding Eclipse installs and workspaces:
The directory location of the Eclipse workspaces should be chosen carefully. Once Eclipse is installed and workspaces are created, they should never be moved to another location in the file system.
There may be multiple installs of Eclipse (of different or similar versions), and single instances of each install can be run simultaneously; but there should never be more that one instance of a specific install running at the same time (to avoid corruption to the Eclipse environment).
Each workspace should be used with only one Eclipse install. You should avoid opening the workspace from more than one installation of Eclipse.

For the purposes of this guide, only a single Eclipse installation will be covered.
Download the current distribution of Eclipse for your OS from the
Eclipse download site
. Choose the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.
The zipped Eclipse file will be downloaded to the local file system and can be saved to a temporary location that can be deleted after Eclipse has been installed. After the file has been downloaded, it should be extracted to the Eclipse installs directory. The following screen capture shows the installation in Linux using an eclipse/installs/ directory. The Eclipse executable will then be found in the “eclipse\installs\eclipse" directory. This installation will be different depending on the operating system.
Because there may potentially be future Eclipse installs extracted into this location, before doing anything else rename the directory, such as to “eclipse/installs/
juno1
/”. Once you begin using this Eclipse install,
it should not be moved or renamed later
.
Installing mToolkit
An additional plugin, mToolkit, is needed to allow remote connectivity to an OSGi framework on a Kura-enabled target device. To install mToolkit into Eclipse, use the following steps:

Creating an Eclipse Workspace
Run Eclipse by clicking its executable in the install directory.
When Eclipse is run for the first time, a workspace needs to be created. A single workspace will contain all the Java code/projects/bundles, Eclipse configuration parameters, and other relevant files for a specific business-level product. If the
Use this as the default
option is selected, the designated workspace becomes the default each time you run Eclipse.
If a workspace has not already been defined, or if you are creating a different workspace for another development project, enter a new workspace name. The workspace should be named appropriate to the project/product being developed.
Note:
Once you begin using a particular workspace,
it should not be moved or renamed at any time
.
Otherwise, select an existing workspace and click
OK
. After Eclipse is running, you can select the Eclipse menu
File | Switch Workspace | Other
to create or open a different workspace.
After the new workspace opens, click the Workbench icon to display the development environment.
. In order to do so:
Obtain an Eclipse Foundation user ID. Anyone who currently uses Eclipse Bugzilla or Gerrit systems already has one of those. If you don't already have an account simply
register on the Eclipse web site
.
Once you have your account, log in to the
projects portal
, select
My Account
and then the
Contributor License Agreement
tab.
Add your GiHub username to your Eclipse Foundation account. Log in to Eclipse and go to
Edit my account
.

to import the projects. At this point, you should have four projects in your workspace. The four projects are as follows:
org.eclipse.kura.api – This is the core Kura API.
org.eclipse.kura.demo.heater – This is an example project that you can use as a starting point for creating your own bundle.
org.eclipse.kura.emulator – This is the emulator project for running Kura within Eclipse (Linux/Mac only).
target-definition – This is a set of required bundles that are dependencies of the APIs and Kura.
Eclipse will also report some errors at this point. See the next section to resolve those errors.

I have always found it hard to meet the requirements of being a student. Ever since my years of high school, I really have no idea what professors are looking for to give good grades. After some google searching, I found this service ⇒ HelpWriting.net ⇐ who helped me write my research paper. The final result was amazing, and I highly recommend ⇒ HelpWriting.net ⇐ to anyone in the same mindset as me.

* Kura Docker container: New Docker Container that wraps in a Centos 7 environment a Kura No Network installation.
* Upload of Asset channels from CSV file: In the Asset view, the user can now download and upload channel descriptions as CSV files.
* Enhancements
* Non-blocking assets configuration updates
* Wires Graph Blinking rate limit
* Added fix validity, latitude and longitude hemisphere fields to GPS NMEA Position
* Reduced CPU usage by Kura Wires
* Refactor and Cleanup
* Modular support of new platforms: Refactoring of framework structure to support, in a pluggable way, different operating systems and
service managers (SysV, Systemd)
* SSL Manager Service: Service refactoring and cleanup. By default, Kura uses for secure communications its own cacerts.ks keystore instead
of the one provided by the Java VM. The default installation provides a cacerts.ks keystore that contains only the Eclipse leaf certificate.
To connect to a different provider or broker, the user must install the corresponding certificate in the cacerts.ks keystore, for example
using the Kura web UI.

Building IoT Mashups for Industry 4.0 with Eclipse Kura and Kura Wires
* Modular support of new platforms: Refactoring of framework structure to support, in a pluggable way, different operating systems and
service managers (SysV, Systemd)
* SSL Manager Service: Service refactoring and cleanup. By default, Kura uses for secure communications its own cacerts.ks keystore instead
of the one provided by the Java VM. The default installation provides a cacerts.ks keystore that contains only the Eclipse leaf certificate.
To connect to a different provider or broker, the user must install the corresponding certificate in the cacerts.ks keystore, for example
using the Kura web UI.
* New framework folder structure: The framework folder structure has been redesigned to simplify the user interaction.
* Drivers
* New drivers available also in the Eclipse Kura Marketplace:
* iBeacon Scanner
* Eddystone Scanner
* Dummy Driver
* New Hardware Platforms and Distributions
* Intel UP Square Boards running Ubuntu and CentOS
* Rockchip Rock960 AARCH 64 running Ubuntu
* Target Platform Updates
* #2096: [NetAdmin] Issues using GPS if modem has never been enabled
* #2091: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found
* #2089: [NetAdmin] Some state of the logic that manages modems persists across resets
* #2087: [NetAdmin] Race condition between NetAdmin and PositionService after modem reset

I have always found it hard to meet the requirements of being a student. Ever since my years of high school, I really have no idea what professors are looking for to give good grades. After some google searching, I found this service ⇒ HelpWriting.net ⇐ who helped me write my research paper. The final result was amazing, and I highly recommend ⇒ HelpWriting.net ⇐ to anyone in the same mindset as me.

* Connection Monitor: A connection monitor will be introduced to the DataService to further
improve connectivity reliability.
* RPMs: This release will provide RPM packaging for Fedora based distributions.
Compatibility:
* Eclipse Kura v3.1.0 does not introduce API breakage with previous releases.
* This release does introduce a new set of APIs for TinyB for interacting with BLE devices.
* In Kura v3.1.0 it is possible to instantiate a Driver instance from the Drivers and Assets
section or from Wire Composer only if the following requirements are met:
- the Driver implementation class must implement the following interfaces:
- Driver
- ConfigurableComponent or SelfConfigurableComponent
- the Driver must provide a component definition xml file that advertises that
the interfaces mentioned above are provided and that sets "required" as configuration policy.
It is advisable to update the deployment packages of non compliant drivers if needed.
It is still possible to instantiate non compliant drivers using the "+" button under "Services".
* #1717: Fixed firewall init script
* #1716: Fixed "watchdog did not stop" messages in syslog

Creating end-to-end IoT applications with Eclipse Kura & Solair IoT P…
https://github.com/eclipse/kura/wiki/Kura-Wires:-introduction-and-references
* Eclipse Kura Drivers and Assets APIs and implementations
* Contributed Eclipse Kura OPC UA driver based on Eclipse Milo
* Improvements to local Web Console's usability and appearance
* Added support for MQTT over Websockets
* Added support for AWS IoT and Azure IoT platforms
* Simple JSON is now a supported encoding option in Eclipse Kura Cloud Service
* Introduced official support to Oomph installer
* Added support for Fedora 25 ARM based systems
Compatibility Changes:
* Switched to Equinox 3.11.1
* Added support for Java 8. It is now the minimal JVM requirement to run Eclipse Kura
* Dropped support for all the native libraries but ARMv6 HF and x86_64 architectures
* Dropped support for Fedberry 24 systems
* The configuration service will only track so called "Relevant services" so the ones that, in their component
description files, will provide the ConfigurableComponent interface. The old behavior can be restored by setting the
"org.eclipse.kura.core.configuration.legacyServiceTracking" property to true.
* #372: [BLE] BluetoothGattImpl.getCharacteristics(String startHandle, String endHandle) and getServices() methods return empty list
* #352: [Semantic Versioning] Enable analysis through bnd-baseline-maven-plugin
* #288: [Modbus] Implement the MBAP header for TCP/IP communication
* #244: [Web UI] Alphabetical ordering of metatype labels option in ListBoxes
* Merged no issue-related Pull Requests:
* #1370: Fixed connection status icon at page load.
* #1365: Fixed deleted factory components not always being removed from snapshot (see also #1371)
* #1364: Fixed factory components not being created from uploaded snapshot
* #1352: Minor Wires fixes
* #1350: Set security level to low
* #1349: Changes to the emulator launch profiles used when cloning directly the repo
* #1347: Modified emulator position.
* #1344: Minor fixes regarding emulator.position and osgi.annotation.
* #1343: Hidden export to CSV buttons from Wires Web UI
* #1341: Modified Asset Cloudlet protocol

Possible Improvements • Real-time vehicle monitoring system as on-board computer and remote data management • Predictive vehicle maintenance based on historical data and analysis of wear of components • Black Box for security applications and insurance companies • Fleet Management and vehicle pooling for enterprise business • Track Day recording telemetry and timings (possible race scenario with multiple vehicles data) • In-car entertainment systems integration (and Android Auto) for advanced services (for example recognise the driCarplayver and automatically set the preferred radio stations or playlists); in this case the Kura gateway acts as on-board digital hub.

+ Debugging and Logging  After accessing the Pi through ssh you will be able to inspect the log files and control Kura using these commands: tail –f /var/log/kura.log tail –f /var/log/kura-console.log telnet 127.0.0.1 5002 will show the realtime kura log will show the System.err log will open the OSGi telnet terminal sudo /etc/init.d/kura restart Will restart Kura. Bundles installed with mToolkit will be removed.

+ Setting up the Digital Light Sensor Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi The Rapsberry Pi ships with the I2C disabled. In order to communicate with the Grove Digital Light Sensor we have to enable the Linux modules that will enable I2C communication on the Pi. Enter the following commands in the Pi command line: sudo nano /etc/modules And add these two lines to the file: i2c-bcm2708 i2c-dev Then save the file and reboot the Pi
23.
+ Setting up the Digital Light Sensor Worker overview Stub file: LuxCalculation.stub.java  Detecting luminosity changes will be demanded to a separate Runnable  The I2C Digital Light Sensor is acquired and managed using OpenJDK Device I/O APIs, provided by Kura  The worker will be constantly polling the Light Sensor reading the luminosity and will trigger listeners when it needs to.  The change in luminosity between polls is evaluated using several thresholds, programmable through the Kura Web UI.  The LUX value is calculated using an helper method, provided in the stub.
24.

26.
27.
28.
+ Game Logic Overview  When the game starts, player must be set to 0 scored points and must have a programmable amount of rounds (default 12)  When the player fires a round (C button) the game starts listening for lux change on the DLS for a programmable time window (default 200ms)  Available rounds are decreased by 1. If the lux change is detected in the time frame, 1 point is scored, led and buzzer get activated  Lux variance threshold is programmable. Defaults to 300lux  Once the clip is empty the player should reload the gun (B button). Reload will take a programmable amount of time (default 5s) during which no point can be scored.  Game should subscribe to a Commands topic, listening for «NewGame» and «StopGame» commands.  When receiving a «NewGame» it should reset score and available rounds  When receiving a «StopGame» it should stop scoring points until a «NewGame» is received
