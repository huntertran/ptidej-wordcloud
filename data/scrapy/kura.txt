The extensible open source Java/OSGi IoT Edge Framework
Eclipse Kura™ is an extensible open source IoT Edge Framework based on Java/OSGi. Kura offers API access to the hardware interfaces of IoT Gateways (serial ports, GPS, watchdog, GPIOs, I2C, etc.). It features ready-to-use field protocols (including Modbus, OPC-UA, S7), an application container, and a web-based visual data flow programming to acquire data from the field, process it at the edge, and publish it to leading IoT Cloud Platforms through MQTT connectivity.

This section provides Eclipse Kura™ quick installation procedures for the
Raspberry Pi and the Kura development environment.
Note: This quickstart will install the version of Kura with the administrative web UI and network configuration support but not CAN support. For more information on this please visit the Eclipse Kura download page
This quickstart has been tested using the following image:
2019-07-10-raspbian-buster-lite.img
downloaded from
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
and with the NOOBS image installed on the sd card bundled with the Raspberry Pi 3.
Enable SSH Access
The ssh server is disabled by default on Raspbian images released after November 2016,
in order to enable it to follow the instructions available at the following URL:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/
Eclipse Kura™ Installation
Note: The last Raspbian Stretch adopts the new Consistent Network Device Naming. To correctly run Eclipse Kura on the Raspberry Pi, it should be disabled adding the net.ifnames=0 parameter at the end of the /boot/cmdline.txt file.
To install Kura with its dependencies on the Raspberry Pi, perform the
following steps:

Boot the Raspberry Pi with the latest Raspbian image (starting from release 2.1.0 Kura only supports Debian 8 or above).
The dhcpcd5 package is not compatible with Kura and needs to be removed
performing the following command:
sudo apt-get purge dhcpcd5
After removing dhcpcd5 package you need to enable network interface(s) and ensure internet access. Follow the instructions here.
Install the gdebi command line tool:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
Make sure that Java 8 is installed with
java -version
if not install OpenJDK 8 performing the following command:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless
Download the Kura package with:
wget http://download.eclipse.org/kura/releases/<version>/kura_<version>_raspberry-pi-2-3_installer.deb

Eclipse Kura - 4.1.2 - October 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Changes:
* Enhancements
* Enhanced the modem support with Ublox LARA R2
* Improved and uniformed the Web UI Response Headers
* Added support for the Telefonica modem IK41VE
Installing Eclipse
Before installing Eclipse, you should choose directory locations for the Eclipse install and its workspaces.
Note: The following points should be kept in mind regarding Eclipse installs and workspaces:The directory location of the Eclipse workspaces should be chosen carefully. Once Eclipse is installed and workspaces are created, they should never be moved to another location in the file system.There may be multiple installs of Eclipse (of different or similar versions), and single instances of each install can be run simultaneously; but there should never be more that one instance of a specific install running at the same time (to avoid corruption to the Eclipse environment).Each workspace should be used with only one Eclipse install. You should avoid opening the workspace from more than one installation of Eclipse.For the purposes of this guide, only a single Eclipse installation will be covered.
Download the current distribution of Eclipse for your OS from the Eclipse download site. Choose the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.
The zipped Eclipse file will be downloaded to the local file system and can be saved to a temporary location that can be deleted after Eclipse has been installed. After the file has been downloaded, it should be extracted to the Eclipse installs directory. The following screen capture shows the installation in Linux using an eclipse/installs/ directory. The Eclipse executable will then be found in the “eclipse\installs\eclipse" directory. This installation will be different depending on the operating system.
Because there may potentially be future Eclipse installs extracted into this location, before doing anything else rename the directory, such as to “eclipse/installs/juno1/”. Once you begin using this Eclipse install, it should not be moved or renamed later.
Installing mToolkit
An additional plugin, mToolkit, is needed to allow remote connectivity to an OSGi framework on a Kura-enabled target device. To install mToolkit into Eclipse, use the following steps:
Open the Help | Install New Software… menu.
Add the following URL as an update site based on your version of Eclipse
Eclipse Mars and older: http://mtoolkit-mars.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Eclipse Neon: http://mtoolkit-neon.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Install the “mToolkit” feature (you need to uncheck the Group items by category checkbox in order to see the feature)
Restart Eclipse. In the menu Window | Show View | Other, there should be an mToolkit | Frameworks option. If so, the plugin has been installed correctly.

Notes
sudo gdebi kura_<version>_raspberry-pi-2-3_installer.deb
It could happen that ‘wlan’ interface is “soft blocked” by default and needs to be enabled. To see if it is blocked run:
rfkill list
and unblock it with:
sudo rfkill unblock wlan
Reboot the Raspberry Pi with:
sudo reboot
Kura starts on the target platform after reboot.
Kura setups a local web ui that is available using a browser via:
https://<device-ip>
The browser will prompt the user to accept the connection to an endpoint with an untrusted certificate:
Once trusted the source, the user will be redirected to a login page where the default username is:
admin
and the default password is:
admin

Creating an Eclipse Workspace
Run Eclipse by clicking its executable in the install directory.
When Eclipse is run for the first time, a workspace needs to be created. A single workspace will contain all the Java code/projects/bundles, Eclipse configuration parameters, and other relevant files for a specific business-level product. If the Use this as the default option is selected, the designated workspace becomes the default each time you run Eclipse.
If a workspace has not already been defined, or if you are creating a different workspace for another development project, enter a new workspace name. The workspace should be named appropriate to the project/product being developed.
Note: Once you begin using a particular workspace, it should not be moved or renamed at any time.
Otherwise, select an existing workspace and click OK. After Eclipse is running, you can select the Eclipse menu File | Switch Workspace | Other to create or open a different workspace.
After the new workspace opens, click the Workbench icon to display the development environment.
Importing Kura User Workspace
To set up your Kura project workspace, you will need to download the Kura User Workspace archive.
From the Eclipse File menu, select the Import option. In the Import dialog box, expand the General heading, select Existing Projects into Workspace, and then click Next.
Now click the Select archive file option button and browse to the archive file, such as user_workspace_archive_2.0.1.zip.
Finally, click Finish to import the projects. At this point, you should have four projects in your workspace. The four projects are as follows:
org.eclipse.kura.api – This is the core Kura API.

I have always found it hard to meet the requirements of being a student. Ever since my years of high school, I really have no idea what professors are looking for to give good grades. After some google searching, I found this service ⇒ HelpWriting.net ⇐ who helped me write my research paper. The final result was amazing, and I highly recommend ⇒ HelpWriting.net ⇐ to anyone in the same mindset as me.

* Wires Graph Blinking rate limit
* Added fix validity, latitude and longitude hemisphere fields to GPS NMEA Position
* Reduced CPU usage by Kura Wires
* Refactor and Cleanup
* Modular support of new platforms: Refactoring of framework structure to support, in a pluggable way, different operating systems and
service managers (SysV, Systemd)
* SSL Manager Service: Service refactoring and cleanup. By default, Kura uses for secure communications its own cacerts.ks keystore instead
of the one provided by the Java VM. The default installation provides a cacerts.ks keystore that contains only the Eclipse leaf certificate.
To connect to a different provider or broker, the user must install the corresponding certificate in the cacerts.ks keystore, for example
using the Kura web UI.
* New framework folder structure: The framework folder structure has been redesigned to simplify the user interaction.
* Drivers
* New drivers available also in the Eclipse Kura Marketplace:
* iBeacon Scanner
* Eddystone Scanner
* #2347: Solved some blocking lint issues
* #2346: Changes to solve lint issues in CloudConnectionStatus.
* #2345: Fixed lint issue
* #2344: Solved some major lint issues in MqttDataTransport.java

I have always found it hard to meet the requirements of being a student. Ever since my years of high school, I really have no idea what professors are looking for to give good grades. After some google searching, I found this service ⇒ HelpWriting.net ⇐ who helped me write my research paper. The final result was amazing, and I highly recommend ⇒ HelpWriting.net ⇐ to anyone in the same mindset as me.

Description:
Eclipse Kura 4.0.0, compatible with Java 9 and OSGi R6, introduces a new model that simplifies plugging new cloud connection implementations.
It brings up a restructuring of the networking part to make it more pluggable and expandable, new drivers and supported platforms, as well as
improvements to usability and bug fixes.
Being a major release, it also includes breaking changes and removes support for code and platforms no longer maintained by the original contributors.

* #2164: [Asset] Make configuration updates non-blocking
* Added fix validity, latitude and longitude hemisphere fields to GPS NMEA Position
* Reduced CPU usage by Kura Wires
* Refactor and Cleanup
* Modular support of new platforms: Refactoring of framework structure to support, in a pluggable way, different operating systems and
service managers (SysV, Systemd)
* SSL Manager Service: Service refactoring and cleanup. By default, Kura uses for secure communications its own cacerts.ks keystore instead
of the one provided by the Java VM. The default installation provides a cacerts.ks keystore that contains only the Eclipse leaf certificate.
To connect to a different provider or broker, the user must install the corresponding certificate in the cacerts.ks keystore, for example
using the Kura web UI.
* New framework folder structure: The framework folder structure has been redesigned to simplify the user interaction.
* Drivers
* New drivers available also in the Eclipse Kura Marketplace:
* iBeacon Scanner
* Eddystone Scanner
* Dummy Driver
* New Hardware Platforms and Distributions
* Intel UP Square Boards running Ubuntu and CentOS

* #1755: Modified the success notification in order to not being executed in a different thread.
* #1738: Modified localization.resources fragment to reference the host with a version range.
* #1432: Remove Intel Edison Profile
Know Issues :
* The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
password that is hardcoded and published.
* Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
* BLE only tested on the Raspberry Pi B with a Broadcom BCM20702 USB dongle and the TI SensorTag. The kernel version was
"Linux raspberrypi 3.18.11-v7+ #781 SMP PREEMPT Tue Apr 21 18:07:59 BST 2015 armv7l GNU/Linux".
Note that on the kernel "Linux version 4.1.7-v7+ (dc4@dc4-XPS13-9333) (gcc version 4.8.3 20140303 (prerelease)
(crosstool-NG linaro-1.13.1+bzr2650 - Linaro GCC 2014.03) ) #817 SMP PREEMPT Sat Sep 19 15:32:00 BST 2015" has a bug on
gatttool and the BLE connection will encounter a failure.
* The TinyB library used by the Bluetooth LE API implementation sometimes cause a JVM crash.
* WiFi on Raspberry Pi only tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).

Applications
* BLE via TinyB: To improve the reliability of BLE, Kura will switch to the TinyB library
to support BLE via Bluez.
* Kura Wires Functional Logic: To extend the usability of Kura Wires, this release will
include Functional Logic Wire Components. This will allow the use of plain JavaScript
inside a Wire component.
* Kura Web UI Update: A new UI element will be added for managing and editing Drivers and Assets.
* S7 Industrial Protocol: A new driver will be added to the Eclipse Marketplace to support S7.
* BLE/SensorTag: A new driver will be added to the Eclipse Marketplace to support BLE on
the TI SensorTag.
* MQTT publish rate improvement: A limit parameter will be added to the MQTT transport service
to allow throttling of MQTT messages to prevent unnecessary congestion on the MQTT broker.
* Connection Monitor: A connection monitor will be introduced to the DataService to further
improve connectivity reliability.
* RPMs: This release will provide RPM packaging for Fedora based distributions.
Compatibility:
* Eclipse Kura v3.1.0 does not introduce API breakage with previous releases.
AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
* Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
* Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
* Web UI may hang when configuration snapshot is uploaded. This happens because HTTP connection is lost due to toggling of the network
interface which happened even if network configuration hasn't been modified.
* #2050: Modem monitor in Not connected state does not trigger reset
* #2040: [Kura 3.2.0 QA] PositionService does not switch between GPS and static position
* #2013: Unsaved changes dialog triggers incorrectly
* #1999: Connection refresh sometimes causes duplicate entries
* #1995: Failed NET-WIFI-003 on Fedora
* #1993: NET-ETH0-003 failed
* #1932: SystemAdminService.getUptime() returns SystemAdminService#UNKNOWN on MacOS when locale is not English
* #1788: Maven Archetype does not work - or can someone show me how to use it?
* #1663: Authentication Issue with Deploy V2
* #1644: [Artemis] MQTT clients fail to reconnect after the broker is restarted

* This release does introduce a new set of APIs for TinyB for interacting with BLE devices.
* In Kura v3.1.0 it is possible to instantiate a Driver instance from the Drivers and Assets
section or from Wire Composer only if the following requirements are met:
- the Driver implementation class must implement the following interfaces:
- Driver
- ConfigurableComponent or SelfConfigurableComponent
- the Driver must provide a component definition xml file that advertises that
the interfaces mentioned above are provided and that sets "required" as configuration policy.
It is advisable to update the deployment packages of non compliant drivers if needed.
It is still possible to instantiate non compliant drivers using the "+" button under "Services".
Target Environments:

Comment goes here.
* The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
password that is hardcoded and published.
* Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
* BLE only tested on the Raspberry Pi B with a Broadcom BCM20702 USB dongle and the TI SensorTag. The kernel version was
"Linux raspberrypi 3.18.11-v7+ #781 SMP PREEMPT Tue Apr 21 18:07:59 BST 2015 armv7l GNU/Linux".
Note that on the kernel "Linux version 4.1.7-v7+ (dc4@dc4-XPS13-9333) (gcc version 4.8.3 20140303 (prerelease)
(crosstool-NG linaro-1.13.1+bzr2650 - Linaro GCC 2014.03) ) #817 SMP PREEMPT Sat Sep 19 15:32:00 BST 2015" has a bug on
gatttool and the BLE connection will encounter a failure.
* WiFi on Raspberry Pi only tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
* Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
* Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
* Web UI may hang when configuration snapshot is uploaded. This happens because HTTP connection is lost due to toggling of the network
interface which happened even if network configuration hasn't been modified.
* #1703: [Kura 3.1.0 QA] Wires page jumping up and down
* #751: [DbDataStore] defrag and checkpoint are not per-table operations
* #572: Unreadable errors in Web UI

* The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
password that is hardcoded and published.
* Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
* BLE only tested on the Raspberry Pi B with a Broadcom BCM20702 USB dongle and the TI SensorTag. The kernel version was
"Linux raspberrypi 3.18.11-v7+ #781 SMP PREEMPT Tue Apr 21 18:07:59 BST 2015 armv7l GNU/Linux".
Note that on the kernel "Linux version 4.1.7-v7+ (dc4@dc4-XPS13-9333) (gcc version 4.8.3 20140303 (prerelease)
(crosstool-NG linaro-1.13.1+bzr2650 - Linaro GCC 2014.03) ) #817 SMP PREEMPT Sat Sep 19 15:32:00 BST 2015" has a bug on
gatttool and the BLE connection failes.
* WiFi on Raspberry Pi only tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
* Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
* Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
* Web UI may hang when configuration snapshot is uploaded. This happens because HTTP connection is lost due to toggling of the network
interface which happened even if network configuration hasn't been modified.
* #1174: Switch default behavior to only track relevant services
* #1173: OPC-UA Driver: Minor Fixes and Cleanup
* #1168: Modified emulator launch.
* #1154: Use window.parent instead of top in wires js and GWT parts
* #1148: Enable JMX by default, allow overriding using system properties
* #1144: [Developer workspace] Added 2 plugins and worspaces
* #1143: Added support for enabling serial rx timeout
* #1140: Improve separation of concerns for camel java example
* #1136: Implement Kapua's applicationFramework/applicationFrameworkVersion
* #1127: Changes to prevent exception of wires panel refresh.
* #1122: Implement new Cloud Client API
* #1115: Few more fixes in wires:
* #1103: Added drag and drop support to the Wire Composer.
* #1102: Improved drag and drop for Eclipse Marketplace.

I must admit I was very skeptical of ⇒⇒⇒ ESSAYWRITENOW.COM ⇐⇐⇐ at first, but after taking a chance, it has been a total blessing in disguise.

I'd advise you to use this service: ⇒ www.HelpWriting.net ⇐ The price of your order will depend on the deadline and type of paper (e.g. bachelor, undergraduate etc). The more time you have before the deadline - the less price of the order you will have. Thus, this service offers high-quality essays at the optimal price.

Entities
Built by drag&drop: Solair handles everything underneath
Aggregations of
Concepts become
Entities, logical
representations of
components of your IoT
application
11.
Relationships
You can set multi-level Relationships that
aren’t simple connections between two
Entities or Concepts: they’re what gives meaning to the data model
you create.
Relationships are not links made using common keys, but powerful
tools providing flexibility and future-proofing.

Solair Integration Gateway
18
Solair gateway technology is based on Kura, a
Java/OSGi-based container for IoT applications
running in service gateways.
Kura is an inclusive and targeted software
framework with an extensive set of ready-to-use
Java Plug-Ins (Bundles) provided for unique platform
supplied hardware, network, cellular, and storage
applications

Eclipse Kura - 2.0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug Fixes :
* Merged no issue-related Pull Requests:
* #653: Hotfixes for WiFi for the 2.0.2 service release. This addresses
Kura not restarting hostapd if the service has stopped for some reason.
* #652: This is a hotfix for a process leak in Bluetooth LE when calling hcidump.
* #530: Fix service leak in ComponentUtil
* #528: Fix the lookup of the default value, now done by id.
* #513: Follow Eclipse trademark guidelines
* #508: Refactor Camel router
* #501: Enh build deploy
Know Issues :
* The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
password that is hardcoded and published.
* Kura can be run in a Java 8 VM, but current OSGi container does not support bundles with manifests that specify
a "Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment" equal to "JavaSE-1.8".
* The old GPS position will continue to be shown in the status overview even after the disabling of the static position reporting.
* Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
* BLE only tested on the Raspberry Pi B with a Broadcom BCM20702 USB dongle and the TI SensorTag. The kernel version was
"Linux raspberrypi 3.18.11-v7+ #781 SMP PREEMPT Tue Apr 21 18:07:59 BST 2015 armv7l GNU/Linux".

• Track Day recording telemetry and timings (possible race scenario with
multiple vehicles data)
• In-car entertainment systems integration (and Android Auto) for
advanced services (for example recognise the driCarplayver and
automatically set the preferred radio stations or playlists); in this case the

Reading from the pen will be handled by a Runnable class, which will
constantly poll the pen for input using HID APIs provided by Kura.
A listener is passed in the constructor, so that when the worker detects a
command, it can wake up the caller.

* Multiple connections: updating a service (e.g. MqttDataTransport) of a connection
has the effect to cause the unwanted reactivation of the next higher layer service (i.e. DataService)
of the other connection(s). This in turn will cause the reactivation of all dependent components.
This is not desired and not yet understood (Equinox bug?). See also Github issue #311.

Setting up the Digital Light Sensor
Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi
The Rapsberry Pi ships with the I2C disabled.
In order to communicate with the Grove Digital Light Sensor we have to enable the
Linux modules that will enable I2C communication on the Pi.
Enter the following commands in the Pi command line:
sudo nano /etc/modules
And add these two lines to the file:
i2c-bcm2708
i2c-dev
Then save the file and reboot the Pi

Stub file: LuxCalculation.stub.java
 Detecting luminosity changes will be demanded to a separate Runnable
 The I2C Digital Light Sensor is acquired and managed using OpenJDK
Device I/O APIs, provided by Kura
 The worker will be constantly polling the Light Sensor reading the
luminosity and will trigger listeners when it needs to.
 The change in luminosity between polls is evaluated using several
thresholds, programmable through the Kura Web UI.
 The LUX value is calculated using an helper method, provided in the stub.

change on the DLS for a programmable time window (default 200ms)
 Available rounds are decreased by 1. If the lux change is detected in the time frame, 1
point is scored, led and buzzer get activated
 Lux variance threshold is programmable. Defaults to 300lux
 Once the clip is empty the player should reload the gun (B button). Reload
will take a programmable amount of time (default 5s) during which no point
can be scored.
 Game should subscribe to a Commands topic, listening for «NewGame» and
«StopGame» commands.
 When receiving a «NewGame» it should reset score and available rounds
 When receiving a «StopGame» it should stop scoring points until a «NewGame» is
received
