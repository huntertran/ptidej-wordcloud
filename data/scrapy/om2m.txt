Standard-based Platform
OM2M implements
oneM2M
and
SmartM2M
standard. It provides a horizontal Service Common Entity (CSE) that can be deployed in an M2M server, a gateway, or a device. Each CSE provides Application Enablement, Security, Triggering, Notification, Persistency, Device Interworking, Device Management, etc.
RESTful API
OM2M exposes a
RESTful API
providing primitive procedures for machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, and re-targeting.
Modularity & Extensibility
OM2M is a Java implementation running on top of an
OSGi
Equinox runtime, making it highly extensible via plugins. It is built as an Eclipse product using
Maven
and
Tycho
Get and use OM2M
You can get OM2M by cloning the
repository
, build it and get started following the
OM2M Get Started
.
For all documentation, you can take a look at the
OM2M Eclipse Wiki

If Content is licensed to you under the terms and conditions of a version of the Eclipse Public License ("
EPL
"), with respect to such Content, the term “Contributions” as used herein shall have the meaning provided in the EPL, and any such Contributions uploaded, submitted, or otherwise made available by you to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the EPL and can be made available to others under the terms of the EPL.
If Content is licensed to you under license terms and conditions other than the EPL ("Other License") with respect to such Content the term “Contributions “ as used herein shall mean any modifications, enhancements and/or other code and/or documentation related to such Content uploaded, submitted, or otherwise made available by you to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site, and such Contributions shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions of the Other License. In addition, with regard to such Contributions, you agree to provide the Contributions under the terms and conditions of the EPL, provided however that the Eclipse Foundation shall have the right to reject any Contributions if the acceptance by the Eclipse Foundation would be in any way inconsistent with the Eclipse Foundation's Intellectual Property Policy.
In addition to the licenses granted above, you grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license of all necessary rights under your copyright in and to your Contributions (the “Specification Grant”): (a) for the Eclipse Foundation (and its contributors solely as a part of Eclipse Foundation projects) to create, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense specifications subject to the terms of the then-current
Eclipse Foundation Specification License
, based on or derived from the Specification Content (as defined below) and (b) for recipients of such specifications to create, reproduce, and distribute implementations thereof based on the portion of your Contributions or material derived from them in the specifications, subject to the terms of the then-current

.
“Specification Content” is the collection of interface definitions for the application or user interfaces (“Interfaces”) provided by the work to which your Contribution was made, descriptions of the structure and semantic behavior of those Interfaces, and data formats and protocols associated with those Interfaces, all of which as are reasonably necessary to enable the development of independent implementations of those Interfaces. For the sake of clarity, Specification Content does not include implementation detail of how the Eclipse project code or your Contribution implements the Interfaces in the Specification and the Specification Grant provide above would not cover such additional material.
To the extent you submit or otherwise make available to an Eclipse Foundation Specification Project (as that term is defined by the Intellectual Property Policy) any ideas, concepts, methods or other information, you agree that you will not assert, based on such submissions, any intellectual property rights that are essential to any implementation of the submission, against the Eclipse Foundation, its contributors, or its licensees, with respect to any implementation of such Specification (as that term is defined by the Eclipse Foundation Specification Process). To further clarify, such submissions include, but are not limited to, submissions made to any public communications channel such as an email list, forum, or bug report.

Tycho - Building Eclipse plug-ins with maven
Tycho is focused on a Maven-centric, manifest-first approach to building Eclipse plug-ins, features, update sites, RCP applications and OSGi bundles. Tycho is a set of Maven plugins and extensions for building Eclipse plugins and OSGi bundles with Maven. Eclipse plugins and OSGi bundles have their own metadata for expressing dependencies, source folder locations, etc. that are normally found in a Maven POM. Tycho uses native metadata for Eclipse plugins and OSGi bundles and uses the POM to configure and drive the build. Tycho supports bundles, fragments, features, update site projects and RCP applications. Tycho also knows how to run JUnit test plugins using OSGi runtime and there is also support for sharing build results using Maven artifact repositories. Tycho plugins introduce new packaging types and the corresponding lifecycle bindings that allow Maven to use OSGi and Eclipse metadata during a Maven build.
OSGi rules are used to resolve project dependencies and package visibility restrictions are honoured by the OSGi-aware JDT-based compiler plugin. Tycho will use OSGi metadata and OSGi rules to calculate project dependencies dynamically and injects them into the Maven project model at build time. Tycho supports all attributes supported by the Eclipse OSGi resolver (Require-Bundle, Import-Package, Eclipse-GenericRequire, etc). Tycho will use proper classpath access rules during compilation. Tycho supports all project types supported by PDE and will use PDE/JDT project metadata where possible. One important design goal in Tycho is to make sure there is no duplication of metadata between POM and OSGi metadata.

Contribution Questionnaire:
A Contribution Questionnaires (CQ) is the main interface between Eclipse committers and the Intellectual Property Management Team. Prior to committing a significant contribution of content to an Eclipse Foundation project, the committer must fill out this questionnaire and submit it to the Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) for approval. In addition to the EMO, the relevant PMC must also provide a technical review and approval of the contribution. Follow the link to find out more about what we mean by "significant contribution". Bug fixes or minor enhancements do not require PMC or EMO approval.
"About" Templates:
This provides templates for the "about.html" ("About") files used to describe EPL-licensed content.
Default Copyright and License Notice:
The standard copyright and license notice should appear in all source files where possible. Variations on this notice may be required (for example where a license other than the EPL governs the use of the file).
IP Logs:
An IP Log is a record of the intellectual property contributions to a project. This includes such as a list of all committers, past and present, that have worked on the code and (especially) those who have made contributions to the current code base.
New Committer Process:
The process for project leads and PMC members to add additional committers to an existing project.
