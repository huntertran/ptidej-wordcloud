Standard-based Platform
OM2M implements
oneM2M
and
SmartM2M
standard. It provides a horizontal Service Common Entity (CSE) that can be deployed in an M2M server, a gateway, or a device. Each CSE provides Application Enablement, Security, Triggering, Notification, Persistency, Device Interworking, Device Management, etc.
RESTful API
OM2M exposes a
RESTful API
providing primitive procedures for machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, and re-targeting.
Modularity & Extensibility
OM2M is a Java implementation running on top of an
OSGi
Equinox runtime, making it highly extensible via plugins. It is built as an Eclipse product using
Maven
and
Tycho
Get and use OM2M
You can get OM2M by cloning the
repository
, build it and get started following the
OM2M Get Started
.
For all documentation, you can take a look at the
OM2M Eclipse Wiki

You can configure MN-CSE and IN-CSE to work on distributed machines.
You can configure multiple MN-CSEs by setting different identifiers.
Startup
IN-CSE startup
Go to the IN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>".
Start the IN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
Once the IN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles. Type "exit" to shutdown.
IN-CSE OSGi console
Open your browser and connect to the address "
http://127.0.0.1:8080/webpage
" to access the IN-CSE web interface.
Enter username "admin" and password "admin" then click on login button to display the IN-CSE resource tree.
IN-CSE web interface: authentication
After a successful authentication, the IN-CSE resource will be displayed. You can see the "in-cse" cseBase sub-resources and attributes.
You can disconnect by clicking on the "Logout" button.

OM2M/one/Developer

Before doing this tutorial you have to
clone and build OM2M using Eclipse
Contents
1
Add a new plug-in to OM2M
1.1
Clone and import OM2M
1.2
Create a new plug-in project
1.3
Convert the plugin into maven project
Once the MN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles.
The MN-CSE automatically authenticate to the remote IN-CSE specified in the gateway configuration file. If the IN-CSE is not already running, the MN-CSE keep sending authentication requests (A request each 10 seconds).
After a successful authentication, the “mn-cse” resource is added to the in-cse resource tree, and respectively the “in-cse” resource is added to the mn-cse resource tree. You can now access the registered MN-CSE resource from the IN-CSE web interface under the “/in-cse/in-name/mn-cse” uri.
Using the In-CSE web interface you can seamlessly access to all authenticated gateways. You notice the existence of one authenticated MN-CSE with id "mn-cse".
Click on the "mn-cse" resource to display remote MN-CSE sub-resources and attributes. You can click on the “mn-cse” button of the “link” attribute to connect to the MN-CSE resources tree.
IN-CSE web interface: remote mn-cse resource
The MN-CSE resource tree will be displayed. At this moment, the IN-CSE will act as a proxy to retarget your requests to the MN-CSE.
IN-CSE web interface: mn-cse cseBase resource
Initially, also the MN-CSE contains the CseBase resource (id=mn-cse), the AccessRight resource (id=acp_admin), and other empty collections.
Multiple gateways scenario
Let's consider a simple M2M system composed of a server and two gateways as follows:
Server IP: 192.168.0.2
Gateway1 IP: 192.168.0.3
Gateway2 IP: 192.168.0.4
Of course, you can test the system locally in one machine by using the IP 127.0.0.1 for all products.
After building the OM2M project normally, you will obtain 1 IN-CSE product, 1 MN-CSE product and 1 ADN-CSE product.
You can configure the IN-CSE with the default configuration like this:
IN-CSE config.ini file:
Now, copy the MN-CSE product in another folder. You have now two separate MN-CSEs.
Configure the first MN-CSE with the following configuration:
MN-CSE1 config.ini file:
Then, configure the second MN-CSE with the following configuration:
MN-CSE2 config.ini file:
You can start the system as follows:
Start the IN-CSE product.
Start the MN-CSE1 product.
Start the MN-CSE2 product.
Open the IN-CSE web interface on
http://192.168.0.2:8080/webpage

2.1
Clone OM2M using command line
2.2
build OM2M using command line
3
Clone and build OM2M using Eclipse IDE
3.1
Install Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP Developers
3.2
Configure Maven Proxy (Only if required)
Once the plug-in is converted, open the
pom.xml
file to edit the parent filed.
Click on "select Parent" icon and enter "org.eclipse.om2m" in the "Enter groupId, artifactId or sh1 prefix or pattern" field.
Select "org.om2m.eclipse" and press ok.
maven conversion: Parent edition
We end this step by updating the plug-in project. For this, select the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" project → maven → update project.
Add the plugin as a maven module to the OM2M parent project
In this part, we will add the created plug-in as a module to the om2m platform:
Open the pom file of the
org.eclipse.om2m
package.
Go to the
modules
tab and press
Add
button.
Select the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in and press
ok
.
Build the om2m package and its sub-projects. To do this, select the "org.eclipse.om2m" project → right click → Run as → maven install.
Check the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe was successfully built. At the buid end, we should get this result.
om2m build
Remark: To keep the same display pattern for all the platform' plugins, you can add
description
and
name
tags to the
org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe'
pom.xml
file.
Add the plugin to the OM2M product(s)
The final step consists of adding the created plug-in to one of om2m platform products, i.e the
mn-cse
or the
in-cse
executable. In the following, we choose to add the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in to the mn-cse product:
Select the org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse package.
Open the om2m.product file.
Go in the "Contents" tab.
Press "Add" button and type: org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe
Click on "Ok" button and save.
Build the om2m package and its sub-projects: select the "org.eclipse.om2m" package -> right click -> Run as -> maven install.
To check that the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" was successfully added to the mn-cse product, run the mn-cse and verify in the console if the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" is displayed.

Develop an Interworking Proxy application Entity (IPE) plugin
IPE Activator
The Activator class contains the implementation of the start() and stop() method used to activate and deactivate the IPE plugin.
In the start() method, the Activator registers the IPE Controller service on the registry to make it available for the CORE plugin. Then, it starts tracking the CORE CSE service to use it once the CORE plugin is activated.
In the Stop() method, the Activator can execute some process to make a clean before deactivation such as stopping threads, handle exceptions, etc. In our case, we stop the Monitor that have a set of thread that must be handled.
IPE Monitor
The Monitor class creates one sensor AE called "MY_SENSOR", and one actuator AE called "MY_ACTUATOR". It creates two containers for each applications: "DESCRIPTOR" container to store the description and "DATA" container to store the measurements. For each container the right oBIX XML payload is created as contentInstance.
The Monitor starts two threads to listen to each application data as well. Once a new data is detected, the Monitor creates a new contentInstance including the measurement representation.
Another method is available to stop the monitor and linked threads.
IPE oBIX Util
Convert the description and the measured data of the device to oBIX XML representation.
IPE Controller
Execute received requests from OM2M to the specific technologies.
IPE Util: RequestSender
This class simplify the interaction with the CseService providing the response of specific requests directly. You can take inspiration of this class if you want to create your own request utility/factory.

API Specification for Smart Home - JONES Initiative
The goal of the JONES Initiative is to define and develop a Cloud API for Home Automation. The JONES Cloud API enables applications to integrate remote user devices and data from JONES compliant Smart Home platforms. Today the JONES Initiative partners are Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Nevertheless, the JONES Initiative is open for further, future partners. To define, develop, and evangelize the JONES Cloud API it is paramount to have a common reference architecture as well as a common reference implementation. This reference implementation is developed on OM2M open source project.
NODE-RED nodes for OM2M
Based on Node-RED, node-red-contrib-ide-iot is a module that allows the creation of IoT applications graphically in a simple and efficient way. It uses the OM2M platform as a middleware that provides high level interoperability between the different heterogeneous objects connected to this platform. node-red-contrib-ide-iot modules allow to be connected to several OM2M platforms, manages resources, extract data from sensors in a different ways, manage activators and communicate in a different way. You can download those modules on:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ide-iot
and get documentation on
https://homepages.laas.fr/monteil/drupal/content/node-red-ideom2m
and
http://cwt.nctu.edu.tw/node-red-ideom2m/
. Those modules have been developed and supported by LAAS-CNRS
https://www.laas.fr/public/en
and National Chiao Tung University

This page covers the oneM2M version of OM2M. If you are looking for documentation for the smartM2M version (v0.8.x)
click here
.
OM2M provides an open source service platform for M2M interoperability based on the oneM2M standard. OM2M follows a RESTful approach with open interfaces to enable developing services and applications independently of the underlying network. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It supports multiple protocol bindings such as HTTP and CoAP. Various interworking proxies are provided to enable seamless communication with vendor-specific technologies such as Zigbee and Phidgets devices.

Introduction
OM2M provides a RESTful API for creating and managing M2M resources. It includes several primitive procedures to enable machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, re-targeting, etc.
This API operates on the following primary resource types:
CseBase: describes the hosting CSE, and is the root for all other resources within the hosting CSE.
remoteCse: stores information related to M2M CSEs residing on other M2M machines after successful mutual authentication. It enables Cses interactions using retargeting operations
AE: stores information about the Application Entity after a successful registration on the hosting CSE.
Container: acts as a mediator for data buffering to enable data exchange between applications and CSEs
AccessControlPolicies: manages permissions and permissions holders to limit and protect the access to the resource tree structure.
Group: enhances resources tree operations and simplifying the interactions on the API interfaces by adding the grouping feature. It enables an issuer to send one request to a set of receivers instead of sending requests one by one.
Subscription: stores information related to subscriptions for some resources. It allow subscribers to receive asynchronous notification when an event happens such as the reception of new sensor event or the creation, update, or delete of a resource.
Prerequisites
"JAVA 1.8" is required to run OM2M.
"Apache Maven 3" is required to build OM2M.
