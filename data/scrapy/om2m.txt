Standard-based Platform
OM2M implements
oneM2M
and
SmartM2M
standard. It provides a horizontal Service Common Entity (CSE) that can be deployed in an M2M server, a gateway, or a device. Each CSE provides Application Enablement, Security, Triggering, Notification, Persistency, Device Interworking, Device Management, etc.
RESTful API
OM2M exposes a
RESTful API
providing primitive procedures for machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, and re-targeting.
Modularity & Extensibility
OM2M is a Java implementation running on top of an
OSGi
Equinox runtime, making it highly extensible via plugins. It is built as an Eclipse product using
Maven
and
Tycho
Get and use OM2M
You can get OM2M by cloning the
repository
, build it and get started following the
OM2M Get Started
.
For all documentation, you can take a look at the
OM2M Eclipse Wiki
.
New and Noteworthy
New and Noteworthy
is here to describe the new features of each release from the previous one.
Prerequisites
