NEW: This page covers the oneM2M version of OM2M. If you are looking for documentation for the smartM2M version (v0.8.x) click here.
OM2M provides an open source service platform for M2M interoperability based on the oneM2M standard. OM2M follows a RESTful approach with open interfaces to enable developing services and applications independently of the underlying network. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It supports multiple protocol bindings such as HTTP and CoAP. Various interworking proxies are provided to enable seamless communication with vendor-specific technologies such as Zigbee and Phidgets devices.

Introduction
OM2M provides a RESTful API for creating and managing M2M resources. It includes several primitive procedures to enable machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, re-targeting, etc.
This API operates on the following primary resource types:
CseBase: describes the hosting CSE, and is the root for all other resources within the hosting CSE.
remoteCse: stores information related to M2M CSEs residing on other M2M machines after successful mutual authentication. It enables Cses interactions using retargeting operations
AE: stores information about the Application Entity after a successful registration on the hosting CSE.
Container: acts as a mediator for data buffering to enable data exchange between applications and CSEs
AccessControlPolicies: manages permissions and permissions holders to limit and protect the access to the resource tree structure.
Group: enhances resources tree operations and simplifying the interactions on the API interfaces by adding the grouping feature. It enables an issuer to send one request to a set of receivers instead of sending requests one by one.
Subscription: stores information related to subscriptions for some resources. It allow subscribers to receive asynchronous notification when an event happens such as the reception of new sensor event or the creation, update, or delete of a resource.
Prerequisites
"JAVA 1.8" is required to run OM2M.

This page describes the current plan for the upcoming features of the OM2M project.
Please note that this roadmap is a moving target. Depending on priorities and community contribution, the roadmap can change any time, so do not take it for granted, but see it as a guidance of direction.
Contents
1 Release 1.4.0 (Aug. 05, 2020)
1.1 Features
1.2 Minor updates
2 Release 1.3.0 (March 13, 2018)
2.1 Features
2.2 Fixed bugs
3 Release 1.2.0 (January 04, 2018)
3.1 Features
3.2 Fixed bugs
4 Release 1.1.0 (October 09, 2017)
4.1 Features
Select “org.eclipse.om2m” package and right click. Select “Run as -> maven install”.
Two Eclipse products will be generated after a successful built:
The IN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
The MN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse/target/products/mn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
The ASN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.asn-cse/target/products/asn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
Test OM2M
Go to the IN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>".
Start the IN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on Windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
WARNING for Windows users: don't double click on the "start.bat" file from Eclipse explorer on Windows. This cause unwanted loading of bundles and the platform will NOT be launched. Use the File Explorer instead.
Once the IN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles. Type "exit" to shutdown.
IN-CSE OSGi console
Open your browser and connect to the address "http://127.0.0.1:8080/webpage" to access the IN-CSE web interface.
Enter username "admin" and password "admin" then click on login button to display the IN-CSE resource tree.

Build the om2m package and its sub-projects. To do this, select the "org.eclipse.om2m" project → right click → Run as → maven install.
Check the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe was successfully built. At the buid end, we should get this result.
om2m build
Remark: To keep the same display pattern for all the platform' plugins, you can add description and name tags to the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe' pom.xml file.
<project>
......
<name>org.eclipse.om2m :: sample ipe</name>
<description>org.eclipse.om2m :: sample ipe</description>
.....
</project>
Add the plugin to the OM2M product(s)
The final step consists of adding the created plug-in to one of om2m platform products, i.e the mn-cse or the in-cse executable. In the following, we choose to add the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in to the mn-cse product:
Select the org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse package.
Open the om2m.product file.
Go in the "Contents" tab.
Press "Add" button and type: org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe
Click on "Ok" button and save.

Develop an Interworking Proxy application Entity (IPE) plugin
IPE Activator
The Activator class contains the implementation of the start() and stop() method used to activate and deactivate the IPE plugin.
In the start() method, the Activator registers the IPE Controller service on the registry to make it available for the CORE plugin. Then, it starts tracking the CORE CSE service to use it once the CORE plugin is activated.
In the Stop() method, the Activator can execute some process to make a clean before deactivation such as stopping threads, handle exceptions, etc. In our case, we stop the Monitor that have a set of thread that must be handled.

NEW: This page covers the oneM2M version of OM2M. If you are looking for documentation for the smartM2M version (v0.8.x) click here.
OM2M provides an open source service platform for M2M interoperability based on the oneM2M standard. OM2M follows a RESTful approach with open interfaces to enable developing services and applications independently of the underlying network. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It supports multiple protocol bindings such as HTTP and CoAP. Various interworking proxies are provided to enable seamless communication with vendor-specific technologies such as Zigbee and Phidgets devices.

Convert the plugin into maven project
Open the build.properties file and update the src attributes as depicted in the following figure.
build-properties build
Note: At the end of the tutorial, you may face this error: gogo: BundleException: Error loading bundle activator. when starting the IPE. If this is the case, replacing src/main/java by the default src/ might do the trick.
Select the created plug-in "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" → right click → configure → convert to maven project.
Enter the data as illustrated in the following and press the Finish button.
maven conversion: POM edition
Once the plug-in is converted, open the pom.xml file to edit the parent filed.
Click on "select Parent" icon and enter "org.eclipse.om2m" in the "Enter groupId, artifactId or sh1 prefix or pattern" field.
Select "org.om2m.eclipse" and press ok.
maven conversion: Parent edition
We end this step by updating the plug-in project. For this, select the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" project → maven → update project.
Add the plugin as a maven module to the OM2M parent project
In this part, we will add the created plug-in as a module to the om2m platform:

Go to the MN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse/target/products/mn-cse/<os>/<ws>/arch>".
Start the MN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
Once the MN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles.
The MN-CSE automatically authenticate to the remote IN-CSE specified in the gateway configuration file. If the IN-CSE is not already running, the MN-CSE keep sending authentication requests (A request each 10 seconds).
After a successful authentication, the “mn-cse” resource is added to the in-cse resource tree, and respectively the “in-cse” resource is added to the mn-cse resource tree. You can now access the registered MN-CSE resource from the IN-CSE web interface under the “/in-cse/in-name/mn-cse” uri.
Using the In-CSE web interface you can seamlessly access to all authenticated gateways. You notice the existence of one authenticated MN-CSE with id "mn-cse".
Click on the "mn-cse" resource to display remote MN-CSE sub-resources and attributes. You can click on the “mn-cse” button of the “link” attribute to connect to the MN-CSE resources tree.
IN-CSE web interface: remote mn-cse resource
The MN-CSE resource tree will be displayed. At this moment, the IN-CSE will act as a proxy to retarget your requests to the MN-CSE.
IN-CSE web interface: mn-cse cseBase resource
Initially, also the MN-CSE contains the CseBase resource (id=mn-cse), the AccessRight resource (id=acp_admin), and other empty collections.

Introduction
OM2M provides a RESTful API for creating and managing M2M resources. It includes several primitive procedures to enable machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, re-targeting, etc.
This API operates on the following primary resource types:
CseBase: describes the hosting CSE, and is the root for all other resources within the hosting CSE.
remoteCse: stores information related to M2M CSEs residing on other M2M machines after successful mutual authentication. It enables Cses interactions using retargeting operations
AE: stores information about the Application Entity after a successful registration on the hosting CSE.
Container: acts as a mediator for data buffering to enable data exchange between applications and CSEs
AccessControlPolicies: manages permissions and permissions holders to limit and protect the access to the resource tree structure.
Group: enhances resources tree operations and simplifying the interactions on the API interfaces by adding the grouping feature. It enables an issuer to send one request to a set of receivers instead of sending requests one by one.

The Monitor class creates one sensor AE called "MY_SENSOR", and one actuator AE called "MY_ACTUATOR". It creates two containers for each applications: "DESCRIPTOR" container to store the description and "DATA" container to store the measurements. For each container the right oBIX XML payload is created as contentInstance.
The Monitor starts two threads to listen to each application data as well. Once a new data is detected, the Monitor creates a new contentInstance including the measurement representation.
Another method is available to stop the monitor and linked threads.

Open the pom file of the org.eclipse.om2m package.
Go to the modules tab and press Add button.
Select the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in and press ok.
Build the om2m package and its sub-projects. To do this, select the "org.eclipse.om2m" project → right click → Run as → maven install.
Check the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe was successfully built. At the buid end, we should get this result.
om2m build
Remark: To keep the same display pattern for all the platform' plugins, you can add description and name tags to the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe' pom.xml file.
<project>
......
<name>org.eclipse.om2m :: sample ipe</name>
<description>org.eclipse.om2m :: sample ipe</description>
.....
</project>
Add the plugin to the OM2M product(s)
The final step consists of adding the created plug-in to one of om2m platform products, i.e the mn-cse or the in-cse executable. In the following, we choose to add the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in to the mn-cse product:

2 Talks & Slides
Multiple gateways scenario
Let's consider a simple M2M system composed of a server and two gateways as follows:
Server IP: 192.168.0.2
Gateway1 IP: 192.168.0.3
Gateway2 IP: 192.168.0.4
Of course, you can test the system locally in one machine by using the IP 127.0.0.1 for all products.
After building the OM2M project normally, you will obtain 1 IN-CSE product, 1 MN-CSE product and 1 ADN-CSE product.
You can configure the IN-CSE with the default configuration like this:
IN-CSE config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=IN-CSE
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=in-name
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.2
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8080
Now, copy the MN-CSE product in another folder. You have now two separate MN-CSEs.
Configure the first MN-CSE with the following configuration:
Subscription: stores information related to subscriptions for some resources. It allow subscribers to receive asynchronous notification when an event happens such as the reception of new sensor event or the creation, update, or delete of a resource.
Prerequisites
"JAVA 1.8" is required to run OM2M.
"Apache Maven 3" is required to build OM2M.
Getting started
Clone and Build the project
Config the node(s)
Start the node(s)
Web Interface

Bug 498911 - Error in Access Right verification for PoA notification
Bug 498387 - Smart Device Template (SDT) support
Bug 498374 - FlexContainer feature support

If you want to add specific jar libraries to your plugin, you can follow these steps:
Create a "libs" folder on your plugin project.
Put required specific jar on the "libs" folder.
Open the manifest file of the created plugin and select "runtime" tab.
Go to the "classpath" tab and click on the "Add" button.
Select the required jar and click on "ok" button.
plugin specific jar dependencies
Develop an Interworking Proxy application Entity (IPE) plugin
IPE Activator
The Activator class contains the implementation of the start() and stop() method used to activate and deactivate the IPE plugin.
In the start() method, the Activator registers the IPE Controller service on the registry to make it available for the CORE plugin. Then, it starts tracking the CORE CSE service to use it once the CORE plugin is activated.
In the Stop() method, the Activator can execute some process to make a clean before deactivation such as stopping threads, handle exceptions, etc. In our case, we stop the Monitor that have a set of thread that must be handled.

API Specification for Smart Home - JONES Initiative
The goal of the JONES Initiative is to define and develop a Cloud API for Home Automation. The JONES Cloud API enables applications to integrate remote user devices and data from JONES compliant Smart Home platforms.
Today the JONES Initiative partners are Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Nevertheless, the JONES Initiative is open for further, future partners.
To define, develop, and evangelize the JONES Cloud API it is paramount to have a common reference architecture as well as a common reference implementation. This reference implementation is developed on OM2M open source project.
NODE-RED nodes for OM2M
Based on Node-RED, node-red-contrib-ide-iot is a module that allows the creation of IoT applications graphically in a simple and efficient way. It uses the OM2M platform as a middleware that provides high level interoperability between the different heterogeneous objects connected to this platform. node-red-contrib-ide-iot modules allow to be connected to several OM2M platforms, manages resources, extract data from sensors in a different ways, manage activators and communicate in a different way. You can download those modules on: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ide-iot and get documentation on https://homepages.laas.fr/monteil/drupal/content/node-red-ideom2m and http://cwt.nctu.edu.tw/node-red-ideom2m/ . Those modules have been developed and supported by LAAS-CNRS https://www.laas.fr/public/en and National Chiao Tung University http://www.nctu.edu.tw/en .

You can interact with the system in the same way using JSON instead of XML with an equivalent of the XML body. (Be careful for the Labels to use a JSON array for instance: "lbl":"["label-1", "label-2"].)

};
}.open();
bundleContext.registerService(InterworkingService.class.getName(), new Controller(), null);

Activator.context = null;
System.out.println("Stopping Sample Ipe");
if(monitor != null){
monitor.stop();
monitor = null;
}
}
}
IPE Monitor
The Monitor class creates one sensor AE called "MY_SENSOR", and one actuator AE called "MY_ACTUATOR". It creates two containers for each applications: "DESCRIPTOR" container to store the description and "DATA" container to store the measurements. For each container the right oBIX XML payload is created as contentInstance.

The Monitor starts two threads to listen to each application data as well. Once a new data is detected, the Monitor creates a new contentInstance including the measurement representation.
Another method is available to stop the monitor and linked threads.

API Specification for Smart Home - JONES Initiative
The goal of the JONES Initiative is to define and develop a Cloud API for Home Automation. The JONES Cloud API enables applications to integrate remote user devices and data from JONES compliant Smart Home platforms.
Today the JONES Initiative partners are Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Nevertheless, the JONES Initiative is open for further, future partners.
To define, develop, and evangelize the JONES Cloud API it is paramount to have a common reference architecture as well as a common reference implementation. This reference implementation is developed on OM2M open source project.

Based on Node-RED, node-red-contrib-ide-iot is a module that allows the creation of IoT applications graphically in a simple and efficient way. It uses the OM2M platform as a middleware that provides high level interoperability between the different heterogeneous objects connected to this platform. node-red-contrib-ide-iot modules allow to be connected to several OM2M platforms, manages resources, extract data from sensors in a different ways, manage activators and communicate in a different way. You can download those modules on: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ide-iot and get documentation on https://homepages.laas.fr/monteil/drupal/content/node-red-ideom2m and http://cwt.nctu.edu.tw/node-red-ideom2m/ . Those modules have been developed and supported by LAAS-CNRS https://www.laas.fr/public/en and National Chiao Tung University http://www.nctu.edu.tw/en .

Nodes: Application, Container, ContentInstance, NotificationHandler
A) Installation
Before installing Node-RED, you must have a working installation of Node.js. We recommend you to use the version LTS 8.x of Node.js available at this address: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Once the installation of Node.js has finished, we will proceed with the installation of Node-RED. The easiest way is to use the node package manager ‘npm’ that comes with Node.js as follows:
npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red

PS: To use it as a global module, add the command node-red to your system path. After the installation of Node-RED, you can run it using the command:
node-red
Now, you can access to the Node-RED editor by pointing your browser at the address: http://localhost:1880 .
B) Node-RED
Node-RED provides a feed editor that consists of basically three panels:
Flow Panel: This is the main workspace of the user, where he can create his streams by dragging and dropping nodes from the Node Panel.
Information and Debug Panel: It consists of two tabs:
A debug tab: which allows the users to view the results and outputs of deployed flows and errors encountered during execution.
To create an application streams, the user slips the desired node from the node palette and places it into the workspace. Once he has done with all the required nodes, he has to connect them with arcs to constitute the application.
C) Integration of node-red-contrib-ide-iot in Node-RED
1. Get and download the module node-red-contrib-ide-iot, then integrate it in Node-RED by using the npm link command. This allows you to link it into a local node-red install. In the directory containing the node’s package.json file, and run:
sudo npm link
In your node-red user directory, typically ~/.node-red, run the following command:
npm link node-red-contrib-ide-iot
This will create the appropriate symbolic links between the two directories, so Node-RED will discover the node at start-time. Any changes in the node’s file can be picked up by simplyrestarting Node-RED.

2. As node-red-contrib-ide-iot is published in npm, we can directly use the following command to integrate it into Node-RED:
npm install node-red-contrib-ide-iot
D) Nodes
Platform
To enter the parameters (URL, login, password) describing the OM2M platform solicited in a global way. If earlier configurations have been specified, the user can select one of them directly.
NamedSensor:
To retrieve the measurements produced by a sensor or the the device state using the exact name of the resource representing that sensor.
Example: retrieve the last data instance of LAMP_0 lamp by creating a flow as mentioned below:
Platform: Select the OM2M platform that you want to use
SensorName: the requested sensor name.
ContentInstance: to choose the instance of data to recover (Latest or Oldest)
Name: to name its node in the graphical interface to avoid any ambiguity when using multiple NamedSensor nodes.
The nodes Inject and Debug are already existing nodes in Node-RED, the first node is used to launch our use case and the other to display the result returned by our stream.After connecting all the nodes of our flow, it will be deployed thanks to the Deploy button. Data instance returned :
LabeledSensor: To recover the data produced by a sensor using a dynamic list of labels (keywords).
Example: retrieve the last data instance of the lamp described by the keywords: Type/actuator Category/luminosity Location/home by creating a flow as mentioned below:

Platform: in our case, we use the same platform used previously, so we only have to select the name OM2M_1 that we chose to give to our platform.
ContentInstance: to choose the instance of data to recover (Latest or Oldest)
LabeledName: to introduce the list of labels describing the device to use. The user can delete a given label via add new labels using using add button.
Data instance returned:
SemanticSensor: retrieve a data instance produced by a sensor using semantics via an SPARQL query request.Example: retrieve the last data instance produced by a Phidget presence sensor. This node only work with Semantic LAAS-CNRS version of OM2M.
Result :
DataExtractor: After receiving a data instance returned by a sensor node (NamedSensor, LabeledSensor, SemanticSensor or NotificationsHandler), the user can retrieve the value of a useful value of this instance using this node.
Example: extract the state of the lamp LAMP_0 from the data instance returned by LabeledSensor.
The user can choose one of the properties:
State: state of a given device;
Data: measure retrieved;
Other: to be indicated by the user;
JPath: in the case of a complicated data instance, the user can use the JPath option to introducethe property path via JSONPath.
Result : the lamp is off.
NotificationsHandler: This node acts as an HTTP server to receive notifications regarding the different resources to which the user has subscribed once a new data instance is created.

SemanticActuator: use to control a sensor described by a simple SPARQL query. This node only work with Semantic LAAS-CNRS version of OM2M.
E) Use case 1
1: allows to light the lamp LAMP_1 and to send a mail if a presence is detected and the lamp LAMP_0 is extinguished. This shows that IDE-OM2M nodes can work with other existing nodes in Node-RED.
Results:
The received mail:
F) Use case 2
Create a simple AE by using Application, Container, ContentInstance, Subscription, and NotificationHandler nodes.
Application:
Creates an Application resource. You can specify the following attributes:
Platform: Destination CSE.
Application: AE Id (application name).
Point of Access: PoA URL.
Announce: whether this resource is announced to other CSE or not.

The OM2M project is now cloned and is visible on the Git repositories’ and Package’ explorers.
If you still have an error on Tycho plugin lifecycle, check that you have downloaded the right Eclipse version (RCP and RAP Developers)
Build OM2M using Eclipse
Select “org.eclipse.om2m” package and right click. Select “Run as -> maven install”.
Two Eclipse products will be generated after a successful built:
The IN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
The MN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse/target/products/mn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
The ASN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.asn-cse/target/products/asn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
Test OM2M
Go to the IN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>".
Start the IN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on Windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
WARNING for Windows users: don't double click on the "start.bat" file from Eclipse explorer on Windows. This cause unwanted loading of bundles and the platform will NOT be launched. Use the File Explorer instead.
Once the IN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles. Type "exit" to shutdown.
IN-CSE OSGi console
Open your browser and connect to the address "http://127.0.0.1:8080/webpage" to access the IN-CSE web interface.
Enter username "admin" and password "admin" then click on login button to display the IN-CSE resource tree.

After a successful authentication, the “mn-cse” resource is added to the in-cse resource tree, and respectively the “in-cse” resource is added to the mn-cse resource tree. You can now access the registered MN-CSE resource from the IN-CSE web interface under the “/in-cse/in-name/mn-cse” uri.
Using the In-CSE web interface you can seamlessly access to all authenticated gateways. You notice the existence of one authenticated MN-CSE with id "mn-cse".
Click on the "mn-cse" resource to display remote MN-CSE sub-resources and attributes. You can click on the “mn-cse” button of the “link” attribute to connect to the MN-CSE resources tree.
IN-CSE web interface: remote mn-cse resource
The MN-CSE resource tree will be displayed. At this moment, the IN-CSE will act as a proxy to retarget your requests to the MN-CSE.
IN-CSE web interface: mn-cse cseBase resource
Initially, also the MN-CSE contains the CseBase resource (id=mn-cse), the AccessRight resource (id=acp_admin), and other empty collections.
Multiple gateways scenario
Let's consider a simple M2M system composed of a server and two gateways as follows:
Server IP: 192.168.0.2
Gateway1 IP: 192.168.0.3
Gateway2 IP: 192.168.0.4
Of course, you can test the system locally in one machine by using the IP 127.0.0.1 for all products.

After building the OM2M project normally, you will obtain 1 IN-CSE product, 1 MN-CSE product and 1 ADN-CSE product.
You can configure the IN-CSE with the default configuration like this:
IN-CSE config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=IN-CSE
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=in-name
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.2
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8080
Now, copy the MN-CSE product in another folder. You have now two separate MN-CSEs.
Configure the first MN-CSE with the following configuration:
MN-CSE1 config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=MN-CSE1
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=mn-name1
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.3
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8181
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseId=IN-CSE

org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=MN-CSE2
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=mn-cse2
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.4
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8282
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseId=IN-CSE
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseName=in-name
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseddress=192.168.0.2
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCsePort=8080
You can start the system as follows:
Start the IN-CSE product.
Start the MN-CSE1 product.
Start the MN-CSE2 product.
Open the IN-CSE web interface on http://192.168.0.2:8080/webpage. You will find MN-CSE1 and MN-CSE2 authenticated.
