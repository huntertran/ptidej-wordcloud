Eclipse Foundation Website Privacy Policy
May 24, 2018
The Eclipse Foundation, Inc. ("Eclipse Foundation", "Us" or "We") is a member-supported not-for-profit foundation which acts as the steward of our open source projects, community, and ecosystem. We are committed to our community members’ rights to privacy. We promise to share transparently all aspects of how Eclipse Foundation projects and websites work in regards to privacy, terms, and personal data, and We are in full support of efforts to ensure your protection online. We only collect your personal data with your consent, and collect only as much as We need to provide you the service you request. For example, We need your personal data to register you to one of our conferences. Each time We collect additional personal data from you We will explain what We collect, why We need it, how We use it, how long We keep it, and how We protect it.
You can withdraw consent anytime. We will respect your wishes.
Personal Information on Eclipse Foundation Websites
As a platform for open source innovation and collaboration, personal information on all Eclipse Foundation websites is either meant to be shared, for example records of your contributions to our open source projects, or protected, such as your name and email address when you subscribe to our newsletter.
Any personal data you share with Us, We protect according to this Privacy policy.
Individual Access to Personal Information
We will respond within 30 days to your requests to have access to your personal information collected by Us. We will promptly correct inaccuracies, as the case may be, and We will delete it and/or anonymize it upon your request. Please contact
privacy@eclipse.org

Information Security and Quality
We protect the integrity of your personal information with appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as using encryption for transmission of certain forms of information, to help keep it secure, accurate, current, and complete.
Your personal information may be stored in Canada, the European Union and the United States, always with our same high security standards.
One of the primary purposes of the Eclipse Foundation and its websites is to enable collaborative open source software development. Doing so necessarily requires Us to maintain records of authorship related to all contributions. Any personally identifiable information collected by virtue of your contributions will be publicly available on the Internet in unencrypted form and without access restriction.
We also offer services to our community which provide the ability for users of Eclipse software to store data on Eclipse Foundation servers through services including, but not limited to, the User Storage Service and the Automated Error Reporting Initiative.

Tycho - Building Eclipse plug-ins with maven
Tycho is focused on a Maven-centric, manifest-first approach to building Eclipse plug-ins, features, update sites, RCP applications and OSGi bundles. Tycho is a set of Maven plugins and extensions for building Eclipse plugins and OSGi bundles with Maven. Eclipse plugins and OSGi bundles have their own metadata for expressing dependencies, source folder locations, etc. that are normally found in a Maven POM. Tycho uses native metadata for Eclipse plugins and OSGi bundles and uses the POM to configure and drive the build. Tycho supports bundles, fragments, features, update site projects and RCP applications. Tycho also knows how to run JUnit test plugins using OSGi runtime and there is also support for sharing build results using Maven artifact repositories. Tycho plugins introduce new packaging types and the corresponding lifecycle bindings that allow Maven to use OSGi and Eclipse metadata during a Maven build.
OSGi rules are used to resolve project dependencies and package visibility restrictions are honoured by the OSGi-aware JDT-based compiler plugin. Tycho will use OSGi metadata and OSGi rules to calculate project dependencies dynamically and injects them into the Maven project model at build time. Tycho supports all attributes supported by the Eclipse OSGi resolver (Require-Bundle, Import-Package, Eclipse-GenericRequire, etc). Tycho will use proper classpath access rules during compilation. Tycho supports all project types supported by PDE and will use PDE/JDT project metadata where possible. One important design goal in Tycho is to make sure there is no duplication of metadata between POM and OSGi metadata.

, based on or derived from the Specification Content (as defined below) and (b) for recipients of such specifications to create, reproduce, and distribute implementations thereof based on the portion of your Contributions or material derived from them in the specifications, subject to the terms of the then-current
Eclipse Foundation Specification License
.
“Specification Content” is the collection of interface definitions for the application or user interfaces (“Interfaces”) provided by the work to which your Contribution was made, descriptions of the structure and semantic behavior of those Interfaces, and data formats and protocols associated with those Interfaces, all of which as are reasonably necessary to enable the development of independent implementations of those Interfaces. For the sake of clarity, Specification Content does not include implementation detail of how the Eclipse project code or your Contribution implements the Interfaces in the Specification and the Specification Grant provide above would not cover such additional material.
To the extent you submit or otherwise make available to an Eclipse Foundation Specification Project (as that term is defined by the Intellectual Property Policy) any ideas, concepts, methods or other information, you agree that you will not assert, based on such submissions, any intellectual property rights that are essential to any implementation of the submission, against the Eclipse Foundation, its contributors, or its licensees, with respect to any implementation of such Specification (as that term is defined by the Eclipse Foundation Specification Process). To further clarify, such submissions include, but are not limited to, submissions made to any public communications channel such as an email list, forum, or bug report.
To the extent you wish to upload, submit, or otherwise make Non-Code Content (as defined below) available to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site, you may make that material available under the terms and conditions of the EPL or any other license stipulated for that purpose at
www.eclipse.org/legal
. Non-Code Content is Content for which you own or control all rights, and which is not program code intended to be submitted to a Project (or documentation related to such code) and which is not Stored Information. For example, Non-Code Content would include white papers, dissertations, articles or other literary works, power point presentations, encyclopedias, anthologies, wikis, blogs, diagrams, drawings, sketches, photos or other images, audio content, video content and audiovisual materials.
For all other software, information and other material including, without limitation, ideas, concepts, know-how and techniques, uploaded, submitted or otherwise made available to The Eclipse Foundation, the Members, and/or users of this Website, (collectively "Material"), if the paragraphs above are inapplicable, and if the Material is not Stored Information, you grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) a license under either the applicable Project License(s) (as that term is defined in the Eclipse Intellectual Property Policy), or, if no such Project License(s) is applicable, you grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) the Eclipse Foundation, the Members and the users of this Web-site a worldwide, unrestricted, royalty free, fully paid up, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive license to use, make, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, sell, distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer such Materials, and/or derivative works thereof, and authorize third parties to do any, some or all of the foregoing including, but not limited to, sublicensing others to do any some or all of the foregoing indefinitely.
