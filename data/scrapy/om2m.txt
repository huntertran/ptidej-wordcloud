Standard-based Platform
OM2M implements
oneM2M
and
SmartM2M
standard. It provides a horizontal Service Common Entity (CSE) that can be deployed in an M2M server, a gateway, or a device. Each CSE provides Application Enablement, Security, Triggering, Notification, Persistency, Device Interworking, Device Management, etc.
RESTful API
OM2M exposes a
RESTful API
providing primitive procedures for machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, and re-targeting.
Modularity & Extensibility

API Specification for Smart Home - JONES Initiative
The goal of the JONES Initiative is to define and develop a Cloud API for Home Automation. The JONES Cloud API enables applications to integrate remote user devices and data from JONES compliant Smart Home platforms. Today the JONES Initiative partners are Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Nevertheless, the JONES Initiative is open for further, future partners. To define, develop, and evangelize the JONES Cloud API it is paramount to have a common reference architecture as well as a common reference implementation. This reference implementation is developed on OM2M open source project.

Accept: application/xml
Click on “Clone a Git repository”.
Git clone
Clone the OM2M project using the following link:
http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.git
. In the first page, enter the mentioned link in the URI’s location field. Click Next .
Git clone
In the second page, keep the “master” branch checkbox selected and click Next.
Git clone
In the third page, check the “import all existing projects after clone finishes” and click “Finish”.

Before doing this tutorial you have to
clone and build OM2M using Eclipse
Contents

Clone and import OM2M
Body
(empty)
HTTP response:
Field
Value
Status
200 OK
Body
You can set the
Accept
header to
application/json
if you want a response in JSON format instead of XML.
Create a "MY_SENSOR" application
Send a HTTP request with the following parameters to create a
MY_SENSOR
application on the gateway.
The ASN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.asn-cse/target/products/asn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
Test OM2M
Go to the IN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>".
Start the IN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on Windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
WARNING for Windows users:
don't double click on the "start.bat" file from Eclipse explorer on Windows. This cause unwanted loading of bundles and the platform will NOT be launched. Use the File Explorer instead.
Once the IN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles. Type "exit" to shutdown.
IN-CSE OSGi console
Open your browser and connect to the address "
http://127.0.0.1:8080/webpage
" to access the IN-CSE web interface.
Enter username "admin" and password "admin" then click on login button to display the IN-CSE resource tree.
IN-CSE web interface: authentication
After a successful authentication, the in-cse resource will be displayed. You can see the "in-cse" CseBase sub-resources and attributes.
IN-CSE web interface: in-cse cseBase resource
Congratulation!! You built and started OM2M successfully.

.
OM2M provides an open source service platform for M2M interoperability based on the oneM2M standard. OM2M follows a RESTful approach with open interfaces to enable developing services and applications independently of the underlying network. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It supports multiple protocol bindings such as HTTP and CoAP. Various interworking proxies are provided to enable seamless communication with vendor-specific technologies such as Zigbee and Phidgets devices.

OM2M Team
Introduction
OM2M provides a RESTful API for creating and managing M2M resources. It includes several primitive procedures to enable machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, re-targeting, etc.
This API operates on the following primary resource types:
CseBase: describes the hosting CSE, and is the root for all other resources within the hosting CSE.
remoteCse: stores information related to M2M CSEs residing on other M2M machines after successful mutual authentication. It enables Cses interactions using retargeting operations
AE: stores information about the Application Entity after a successful registration on the hosting CSE.
Container: acts as a mediator for data buffering to enable data exchange between applications and CSEs
AccessControlPolicies: manages permissions and permissions holders to limit and protect the access to the resource tree structure.
Group: enhances resources tree operations and simplifying the interactions on the API interfaces by adding the grouping feature. It enables an issuer to send one request to a set of receivers instead of sending requests one by one.
Subscription: stores information related to subscriptions for some resources. It allow subscribers to receive asynchronous notification when an event happens such as the reception of new sensor event or the creation, update, or delete of a resource.

file.
Add the plugin to the OM2M product(s)
The final step consists of adding the created plug-in to one of om2m platform products, i.e the
mn-cse
or the
in-cse
executable. In the following, we choose to add the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in to the mn-cse product:
Select the org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse package.
Open the om2m.product file.
Go in the "Contents" tab.
Press "Add" button and type: org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe
Click on "Ok" button and save.
Build the om2m package and its sub-projects: select the "org.eclipse.om2m" package -> right click -> Run as -> maven install.
To check that the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" was successfully added to the mn-cse product, run the mn-cse and verify in the console if the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" is displayed.

Start the MN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
Once the MN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles.
The MN-CSE automatically authenticate to the remote IN-CSE specified in the gateway configuration file. If the IN-CSE is not already running, the MN-CSE keep sending authentication requests (A request each 10 seconds).
After a successful authentication, the “mn-cse” resource is added to the in-cse resource tree, and respectively the “in-cse” resource is added to the mn-cse resource tree. You can now access the registered MN-CSE resource from the IN-CSE web interface under the “/in-cse/in-name/mn-cse” uri.
Using the In-CSE web interface you can seamlessly access to all authenticated gateways. You notice the existence of one authenticated MN-CSE with id "mn-cse".
Click on the "mn-cse" resource to display remote MN-CSE sub-resources and attributes. You can click on the “mn-cse” button of the “link” attribute to connect to the MN-CSE resources tree.
IN-CSE web interface: remote mn-cse resource
The MN-CSE resource tree will be displayed. At this moment, the IN-CSE will act as a proxy to retarget your requests to the MN-CSE.
IN-CSE web interface: mn-cse cseBase resource
Initially, also the MN-CSE contains the CseBase resource (id=mn-cse), the AccessRight resource (id=acp_admin), and other empty collections.
Multiple gateways scenario
Let's consider a simple M2M system composed of a server and two gateways as follows:
Server IP: 192.168.0.2
Gateway1 IP: 192.168.0.3
Gateway2 IP: 192.168.0.4
Of course, you can test the system locally in one machine by using the IP 127.0.0.1 for all products.
After building the OM2M project normally, you will obtain 1 IN-CSE product, 1 MN-CSE product and 1 ADN-CSE product.

In the start() method, the Activator registers the IPE Controller service on the registry to make it available for the CORE plugin. Then, it starts tracking the CORE CSE service to use it once the CORE plugin is activated.
In the Stop() method, the Activator can execute some process to make a clean before deactivation such as stopping threads, handle exceptions, etc. In our case, we stop the Monitor that have a set of thread that must be handled.
IPE Monitor
The Monitor class creates one sensor AE called "MY_SENSOR", and one actuator AE called "MY_ACTUATOR". It creates two containers for each applications: "DESCRIPTOR" container to store the description and "DATA" container to store the measurements. For each container the right oBIX XML payload is created as contentInstance.
The Monitor starts two threads to listen to each application data as well. Once a new data is detected, the Monitor creates a new contentInstance including the measurement representation.
Another method is available to stop the monitor and linked threads.
IPE oBIX Util
Convert the description and the measured data of the device to oBIX XML representation.
IPE Controller
Execute received requests from OM2M to the specific technologies.
IPE Util: RequestSender
This class simplify the interaction with the CseService providing the response of specific requests directly. You can take inspiration of this class if you want to create your own request utility/factory.

The OM2M project is now cloned and is visible on the Git repositories’ and Package’ explorers.
If you still have an error on Tycho plugin lifecycle, check that you have downloaded the right Eclipse version (RCP and RAP Developers)
Build OM2M using Eclipse
Select “org.eclipse.om2m” package and right click. Select “Run as -> maven install”.
Two Eclipse products will be generated after a successful built:
The IN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
The MN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse/target/products/mn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
The ASN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.asn-cse/target/products/asn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
Test OM2M
Go to the IN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>".
Start the IN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on Windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
WARNING for Windows users:
don't double click on the "start.bat" file from Eclipse explorer on Windows. This cause unwanted loading of bundles and the platform will NOT be launched. Use the File Explorer instead.
Once the IN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles. Type "exit" to shutdown.

The MN-CSE automatically authenticate to the remote IN-CSE specified in the gateway configuration file. If the IN-CSE is not already running, the MN-CSE keep sending authentication requests (A request each 10 seconds).
After a successful authentication, the “mn-cse” resource is added to the in-cse resource tree, and respectively the “in-cse” resource is added to the mn-cse resource tree. You can now access the registered MN-CSE resource from the IN-CSE web interface under the “/in-cse/in-name/mn-cse” uri.
Using the In-CSE web interface you can seamlessly access to all authenticated gateways. You notice the existence of one authenticated MN-CSE with id "mn-cse".
Click on the "mn-cse" resource to display remote MN-CSE sub-resources and attributes. You can click on the “mn-cse” button of the “link” attribute to connect to the MN-CSE resources tree.
IN-CSE web interface: remote mn-cse resource
The MN-CSE resource tree will be displayed. At this moment, the IN-CSE will act as a proxy to retarget your requests to the MN-CSE.
IN-CSE web interface: mn-cse cseBase resource
Initially, also the MN-CSE contains the CseBase resource (id=mn-cse), the AccessRight resource (id=acp_admin), and other empty collections.
Multiple gateways scenario
Let's consider a simple M2M system composed of a server and two gateways as follows:
Server IP: 192.168.0.2
Gateway1 IP: 192.168.0.3
Gateway2 IP: 192.168.0.4
Of course, you can test the system locally in one machine by using the IP 127.0.0.1 for all products.
After building the OM2M project normally, you will obtain 1 IN-CSE product, 1 MN-CSE product and 1 ADN-CSE product.
You can configure the IN-CSE with the default configuration like this:
IN-CSE config.ini file:
Now, copy the MN-CSE product in another folder. You have now two separate MN-CSEs.
Provide a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer based on Eclipse Equinox.
Integrate Maven and Tycho to automate build process and RCP development.
Provide a protocol-independent CORE plugin to handle generic REST request.
Enable machine registration, application deployment, container management, resource discovery, access right authorization, subscription / notification, group management, and resource announcement.
Provide a HTTP communication binding plugin based on Jetty and Apache HTTP client libraries.
Provide a CoAP communication binding plugin based on the Californium library.
Provide a simple retargeting mechanism to connect HTTP and CoAP enabled devices.
Provide an interworking sample plugin with simulated devices to show how to connect legacy devices.
Provide a web interface plugin for browsing and debugging each machine resource structure.
Provide a DAO persistence layer based on EclipseLink JPA library to support different SQL and NOSQL database solutions.
Replace the DB4O database with the H2 database which provide better performance.
Introduce required persistence parameters to the "config.ini" file to simplify the JPA configuration.
Replace the XSD resource validation with a native validation mechanism that offers more flexibility.
Replace the OASIS OBIX library with a native encoder/decoder based on the JAXB library.
Improve the OM2M performance by optimizing the resource structure and database access.

Add the dependencies depicted in the following figure.
Important!
You need to import om2m nested projects into your workspace to find them in the list below.
plugin dependencies
Add jar dependencies (Only if required)
If you want to add specific jar libraries to your plugin, you can follow these steps:
Create a "libs" folder on your plugin project.
Put required specific jar on the "libs" folder.
Open the manifest file of the created plugin and select "runtime" tab.
Go to the "classpath" tab and click on the "Add" button.
Select the required jar and click on "ok" button.
plugin specific jar dependencies
Develop an Interworking Proxy application Entity (IPE) plugin
IPE Activator
The Activator class contains the implementation of the start() and stop() method used to activate and deactivate the IPE plugin.
In the start() method, the Activator registers the IPE Controller service on the registry to make it available for the CORE plugin. Then, it starts tracking the CORE CSE service to use it once the CORE plugin is activated.
In the Stop() method, the Activator can execute some process to make a clean before deactivation such as stopping threads, handle exceptions, etc. In our case, we stop the Monitor that have a set of thread that must be handled.

IPE Monitor
The Monitor class creates one sensor AE called "MY_SENSOR", and one actuator AE called "MY_ACTUATOR". It creates two containers for each applications: "DESCRIPTOR" container to store the description and "DATA" container to store the measurements. For each container the right oBIX XML payload is created as contentInstance.
The Monitor starts two threads to listen to each application data as well. Once a new data is detected, the Monitor creates a new contentInstance including the measurement representation.
Another method is available to stop the monitor and linked threads.
IPE oBIX Util
Convert the description and the measured data of the device to oBIX XML representation.
IPE Controller
Execute received requests from OM2M to the specific technologies.
IPE Util: RequestSender
This class simplify the interaction with the CseService providing the response of specific requests directly. You can take inspiration of this class if you want to create your own request utility/factory.

Check the created subscription on the web interface.
Create a new event content instance resource under the "DATA" container.
The new event is published to interested subscribers by the gateway.
Here is an example of the "Notify" XML representation:
The Monitor receives a "Notify" resource including the new "ContentInstance".
Remember that the "Notify" resource has a generic structure to support notifications for other type of resources such as "AE", "Container", "Group", "AccessControlPolicy", etc.

This page covers the oneM2M version of OM2M. If you are looking for documentation for the smartM2M version (v0.8.x)
click here
.
OM2M provides an open source service platform for M2M interoperability based on the oneM2M standard. OM2M follows a RESTful approach with open interfaces to enable developing services and applications independently of the underlying network. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It supports multiple protocol bindings such as HTTP and CoAP. Various interworking proxies are provided to enable seamless communication with vendor-specific technologies such as Zigbee and Phidgets devices.

Introduction
OM2M provides a RESTful API for creating and managing M2M resources. It includes several primitive procedures to enable machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, re-targeting, etc.
This API operates on the following primary resource types:
CseBase: describes the hosting CSE, and is the root for all other resources within the hosting CSE.
remoteCse: stores information related to M2M CSEs residing on other M2M machines after successful mutual authentication. It enables Cses interactions using retargeting operations

Router internal error when running in-cse
When I run the in-cse, the in-cse waiting for new cse connecting! but the error happen!
By:
AE: stores information about the Application Entity after a successful registration on the hosting CSE.
Container: acts as a mediator for data buffering to enable data exchange between applications and CSEs
AccessControlPolicies: manages permissions and permissions holders to limit and protect the access to the resource tree structure.
Group: enhances resources tree operations and simplifying the interactions on the API interfaces by adding the grouping feature. It enables an issuer to send one request to a set of receivers instead of sending requests one by one.
Subscription: stores information related to subscriptions for some resources. It allow subscribers to receive asynchronous notification when an event happens such as the reception of new sensor event or the creation, update, or delete of a resource.
Prerequisites
"JAVA 1.8" is required to run OM2M.
"Apache Maven 3" is required to build OM2M.

A) Installation
Before installing Node-RED, you must have a working installation of Node.js. We recommend you to use the version LTS 8.x of Node.js available at this address:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
.
Once the installation of Node.js has finished, we will proceed with the installation of Node-RED. The easiest way is to use the node package manager ‘npm’ that comes with Node.js as follows:
npm install -g –unsafe-perm node-red
PS: To use it as a global module, add the command node-red to your system path. After the installation of Node-RED, you can run it using the command:
node-red
Now, you can access to the Node-RED editor by pointing your browser at the address:

B) Node-RED
Node-RED provides a feed editor that consists of basically three panels:
Flow Panel: This is the main workspace of the user, where he can create his streams by dragging and dropping nodes from the Node Panel.
Information and Debug Panel: It consists of two tabs:
A debug tab: which allows the users to view the results and outputs of deployed flows and errors encountered during execution.
To create an application streams, the user slips the desired node from the node palette and places it into the workspace. Once he has done with all the required nodes, he has to connect them with arcs to constitute the application.
C) Integration of node-red-contrib-ide-iot in Node-RED
Get and download the module node-red-contrib-ide-iot, then integrate it in Node-RED by using the npm link command. This allows you to link it into a local node-red install. In the directory containing the node’s package.json file, and run:
sudo npm link
In your node-red user directory, typically ~/.node-red, run the following command:
npm link node-red-contrib-ide-iot
This will create the appropriate symbolic links between the two directories, so Node-RED will discover the node at start-time. Any changes in the node’s file can be picked up by simplyrestarting Node-RED.
As node-red-contrib-ide-iot is published in npm, we can directly use the following command to integrate it into Node-RED:
npm install node-red-contrib-ide-iot

API Specification for Smart Home - JONES Initiative
The goal of the JONES Initiative is to define and develop a Cloud API for Home Automation. The JONES Cloud API enables applications to integrate remote user devices and data from JONES compliant Smart Home platforms. Today the JONES Initiative partners are Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Nevertheless, the JONES Initiative is open for further, future partners. To define, develop, and evangelize the JONES Cloud API it is paramount to have a common reference architecture as well as a common reference implementation. This reference implementation is developed on OM2M open source project.
NODE-RED nodes for OM2M
Based on Node-RED, node-red-contrib-ide-iot is a module that allows the creation of IoT applications graphically in a simple and efficient way. It uses the OM2M platform as a middleware that provides high level interoperability between the different heterogeneous objects connected to this platform. node-red-contrib-ide-iot modules allow to be connected to several OM2M platforms, manages resources, extract data from sensors in a different ways, manage activators and communicate in a different way. You can download those modules on:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ide-iot

Creates a ContentInstance resource to store application’s data. You can specify the following attributes:
Platform: Destination CSE.
Application: AE Id (application name).
Container: Name of the container.
Labels: The data you want to store. You must describe three fields: Type (str, int, bool, etc.), Name (the name of the attribute), Value (the value of the attribute).
Subscription:
Creates a Subscription source. You can specify the following attributes:
Platform: Destination CSE.
Application: AE Id (application name).
Container: Name of the container you want to subscribe to.
Path: URL of the webservice that will handle the notification of this subscription.
D) Nodes
Platform
To enter the parameters (URL, login, password) describing the OM2M platform solicited in a global way. If earlier configurations have been specified, the user can select one of them directly.
NamedSensor:
To retrieve the measurements produced by a sensor or the the device state using the exact name of the resource representing that sensor.
Example: retrieve the last data instance of LAMP_0 lamp by creating a flow as mentioned below:
Platform: Select the OM2M platform that you want to use
SensorName: the requested sensor name.
ContentIns
tance: to choose the instance of data to recover (Latest or Oldest)
Name: to name its node in the graphical interface to avoid any ambiguity when using multiple NamedSensor nodes.
The nodes Inject and Debug are already existing nodes in Node-RED, the first node is used to launch our use case and the other to display the result returned by our stream.
After connecting all the nodes of our flow, it will be deployed thanks to the Deploy button. Data instance returned :
LabeledSensor:
To recover the data produced by a sensor using a dynamic list of labels (keywords).
Example: retrieve the last data instance of the lamp described by the keywords: Type/actuator Category/luminosity Location/home by creating a flow as mentioned below:

Result :
DataExtractor:
After receiving a data instance returned by a sensor node (NamedSensor, LabeledSensor, SemanticSensor or NotificationsHandler), the user can retrieve the value of a useful value of this instance using this node.
Example: extract the state of the lamp LAMP_0 from the data instance returned by LabeledSensor.
The user can choose one of the properties:
State: state of a given device;
Data: measure retrieved;
Other: to be indicated by the user;
JPath: in the case of a complicated data instance, the user can use the JPath option to introduce
the property path via JSONPath.
Result : the lamp is off.
NotificationsHandler
:
This node acts as an HTTP server to receive notifications regarding the different resources to which the user has subscribed once a new data instance is created.
Example: receive notifications whenever the LAMP_0 lamp status changes. A SUBSCRIPTION resource must be created under the DATA container of LAMP_0.

Eclipse OM2M: Standardized M2M service platform
1. Standardized M2M service platform Mahdi Ben Alaya Thierry Monteil Khalil Drira contact: ben.alaya@laas.fr website: www.om2m.org
2.
Source: ETSI M2M M2M global standardization effort Inverting the pipe IOT / M2M domains • M2M promotes to connect billions of machines in near future covering multiple domains. • The M2M market is highly fragmented with many players across numerous vertical domains. • ETSI M2M and OneM2M are working on a standardized horizontal service platform for M2M interoperability.
3.
4.
OM2M primitive procedures and resources Service capability layer resource tree • OM2M implements a RESTful API. • All M2M communications are performed based on simple primitive procedures. • Each SCL data model is structured using a standardized resource tree. • The resource can be easly triggered using simple CRUD requests. OM2M Primitive procedures
