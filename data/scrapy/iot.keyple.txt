Eclipse Keyple
is an open source framework to facilitate the implementation of terminal processing operating smart card readers, and to defined advanced secure ticketing transaction.
The
Keyple Core
API provides a
universal interface to manage smart card readers
:
The solution is able to handle
any
smart card
reader solutions
:
standard
(contacts/contactless PC/SC, NFC, OMAPI) or
proprietary
in a generic way.
It’s also compatible with
any terminal architecture: local or remote
, for any kind of terminals: mobile, embedded or server. Remote smart card readers could be managed as local readers in a transparent way.
The Core API can be extended with command sets of specific smart card solutions in order to define advanced secure transactions. The project hosts a first extension to support the Calypso ticketing solution.
The
Keyple Calypso
API provides a
high-level interface to implement
fast and secure contactless ticketing transactions based on the
Calypso standard
.
Cards & SAM commands are transmitted in an optimized grouping to limit network exchanges in case of distributed architecture.
A Java implementation of Eclipse Keyple is currently available. First quarter of 2020, a C++ 11 implementation based on the same Object-Oriented Model design will be released too.
