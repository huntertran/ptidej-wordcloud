Eclipse Keyple
is an open source framework to facilitate the implementation of terminal processing operating smart card readers, and to defined advanced secure ticketing transaction.
The
Keyple Core
API provides a
universal interface to manage smart card readers
:
The solution is able to handle
any
smart card
reader solutions
:
standard
(contacts/contactless PC/SC, NFC, OMAPI) or
proprietary
in a generic way.
It’s also compatible with
any terminal architecture: local or remote
, for any kind of terminals: mobile, embedded or server. Remote smart card readers could be managed as local readers in a transparent way.
The Core API can be extended with command sets of specific smart card solutions in order to define advanced secure transactions. The project hosts a first extension to support the Calypso ticketing solution.
The
Keyple Calypso
API provides a
high-level interface to implement
fast and secure contactless ticketing transactions based on the
Calypso standard
.
Cards & SAM commands are transmitted in an optimized grouping to limit network exchanges in case of distributed architecture.
A Java implementation of Eclipse Keyple is currently available. First quarter of 2020, a C++ 11 implementation based on the same Object-Oriented Model design will be released too.

The main evolutions concern the Core module:
To avoid misuse of plugins, now plugins have to be registered to the SE Proxy using plugin factories.
For observable readers, the sequence to detect an SE insertion, wait for its processing and for its removal has been fixed too.
All the plugins have been updated to take into account the factory setting and the SE status notifications.

Wednesday, September 18, 2019
Project:
Eclipse Keyple
Release:
0.7.0 (Java 19/07)
Description:
keyple-java-core 0.7
SE Proxy API: generic universal interface to interface a smartcard reader; transmission of grouped APDU commands; observable reader notification
Transaction API: management of an explicit application selection on a reader; setting of a default selection operation on an observed reader
Known issues/limits
Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits
the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.
Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7
Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
Known issues/limits
PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.7
Reader plugin emulator: allows to define virtual readers to operate the SE Proxy API without native readers.
Known issues/limits:
StubPlugin has a public visibility.
Some tests have a dependency with the Calypso library.
keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.7
Plugin to communicate remotely with a Secure Element; definition of MasterAPI and SlaveAPI to enable Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between Keyple virtual reader terminals and Keyple native reader terminals. MasterAPI manages virtual reader that acts as a proxy to the remote reader.
Known limits in 0.7.0
RemoteSePlugin has a public visibility.
virtualReader#SePresent() API is not implemented
Functions to be renamed in accordance with the RPC standard
keyple-android-plugin-android-nfc 0.7
Plugin interfacing an observable reader operated through the Android NFC API.
Known issues/limits:
AndroidNfcPlugin has a public visibility.
Usage of 'fragment' to remove from the plugin code
SE remove detection capability added in Android 7.0 not yet supported.

Scope:
Eclipse Keyple provides generic librairies for simplifying the development of contactless applications based on the Calypso standard, and for facilitating integration with the secure elements typically involved in a secure contactless solution. Those librairies will also be compliant with the other existing standards af the market.

Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
