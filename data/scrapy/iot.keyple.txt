The goal of Eclipse Keyple is to allow developers to easily implement fast and secure off-line contactless transactions (using NFC cards, mobile phones, …) based on the Calypso standard.
More specifically, Keyple is a set of open source libraries that will initially be available in Java and C++, designed on the same mutual Object-Oriented Model compatible with any terminal architecture: mobile, embedded or server and Interoperable with any smart card reader solution: standard or proprietary, local or remote.
It manages the advanced security features of Calypso but is also able to manage non-Calypso smartcard solutions, for ticketing or payment.
Keyple defines two layers:
Ticketing applications relies on a high-level
Calypso processing API
to manage Calypso commands & security features. For a session with a Portable Object: SAM commands can be automatically generated and sent to the SAM reader or HSM.
Secure Element (SE) readers are integrated through plugins implementing the
SE Proxy API
which manages the communications with a contactless secure element through ant type of contactless reader (local, remote, standard, proprietary…)
Keyple propose a
Local and Remote
Secure Element optimization:
Cards or SAM’s commands are grouped to limit network exchanges for mobile, embedded terminal or server solution.
Keyple can be used with
Standard or Proprietary
SE reader driver:
It will be packaged with plugins to manage standard Secure Element interfaces: Android NFC Reader, Android SmartCard interface, Windows/Linux PC/SC, Java SmartCard IO PC/SC interface.
Keyple can also be extended with plugins implementation to manage proprietary drivers that could be proposed by smartcard reader manufacturers.
Thanks to its modular architecture, Keyple can be used also to communicate with non Calypso contactless portable objects, using the SE Proxy API.

Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.

The mission of the top-level project is to provide open source technology that will be used to build IoT solutions for industry and consumers. It will focus on:
Standards and Protocols implementations that can easily be consumed by end solution developers as well as framework developers
Frameworks and Services that abstract the complexity of hardware, communication and data stack manipulation
Tools that facilitate the development of connected systems
Solutions that build ready-to-run solutions based on the other building blocks
This document describes the composition and organization of the project, roles and responsibilities of the participants, and development process for the project.

Issues
Release Plan
Review Information
keyple-java-core 0.7
SE Proxy API: generic universal interface to interface a smartcard reader; transmission of grouped APDU commands; observable reader notification
Transaction API: management of an explicit application selection on a reader; setting of a default selection operation on an observed reader
Known issues/limits
Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits
the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.
Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7

Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
Known issues/limits
PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.7
Reader plugin emulator: allows to define virtual readers to operate the SE Proxy API without native readers.
Known issues/limits:
StubPlugin has a public visibility.
Some tests have a dependency with the Calypso library.
keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.7
Plugin to communicate remotely with a Secure Element; definition of MasterAPI and SlaveAPI to enable Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between Keyple virtual reader terminals and Keyple native reader terminals. MasterAPI manages virtual reader that acts as a proxy to the remote reader.
Known limits in 0.7.0
RemoteSePlugin has a public visibility.
virtualReader#SePresent() API is not implemented
Functions to be renamed in accordance with the RPC standard
keyple-android-plugin-android-nfc 0.7
Plugin interfacing an observable reader operated through the Android NFC API.
Known issues/limits:
AndroidNfcPlugin has a public visibility.
Usage of 'fragment' to remove from the plugin code
SE remove detection capability added in Android 7.0 not yet supported.
keyple-android-plugin-android-omapi 0.7
Plugin interfacing static readers operated through the SIM Alliance / GlobalPlatform OMAPI.

Transaction API: management of an explicit application selection on a reader; setting of a default selection operation on an observed reader
Known issues/limits
Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits
the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.
Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7
Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
Known issues/limits
PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.7
Reader plugin emulator: allows to define virtual readers to operate the SE Proxy API without native readers.
