Road Map
Connect. Command. Control.
Eclipse Hono™ provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol.
Millions of Devices
Hono is designed for connecting large numbers of IoT devices. Its micro service based architecture and use of a reactive programming model allow for scaling out horizontally.
Uniform API
Connect a multitude of different types of devices to your (cloud) back end. Communicate with all of them via the same simple API regardless of the device protocol.
IoT Protocols
Hono supports devices communicating via common IoT protocols like HTTP, MQTT, AMQP and CoAP out of the box.
Messaging Patterns
Hono provides APIs for important IoT communication patterns:
Telemetry
and
Event
messages can be used by devices to report sensor readings whereas applications can use
Command & Control
to invoke operations on devices.
Secure
Hono is designed for security by default. It supports common authentication mechanisms like username/password and X.509 client certificates to verify a device’s identity and uses transport layer security (TLS) when communicating with devices.
Extensible
Your device uses a custom protocol? Hono provides a simple mechanism to add custom protocol adapters.

Road Map
We are trying our best to anticipate the needs and requirements of users based on the feedback we get from users. From this information we maintain a
Road Map
for the next several releases.
We try to maintain a steady pace of releases every three months with milestones in between. However, due to changes in requirements over time and because we all have only limited time to spend on Hono, the scope of the releases may change over time as well. The best way to make sure that a certain feature that you anticipate or need the most actually makes it into a release, is by
becoming a contributor
and/or committer to Hono yourself.

Binaries
Eclipse Hono’s service components are provided by means of pre-built Docker images available from
Docker Hub
. The main purpose of the system is to provide an environment for experimenting with devices and how to connect them to Hono without the need for setting up a local instance.
Deprecated domain name
The sandbox used to be available at
hono.eclipse.org
. That domain name will still work for some time but will eventually be disabled. Please update your URLs accordingly.
The sandbox hosts a Hono instance consisting of the same components as described in the
Getting started Guide
. All services are exposed via the same ports as used in the guide.
Take note
The sandbox is intended for
testing purposes only
. Under no circumstances should it be used for any production use case. It is also
not allowed
to register with nor publish any personally identifiable information to any of the sandbox’s services.
You can use the sandbox without revealing who you are or any information about yourself. The APIs of the Device Registry running on the sandbox can be used anonymously for creating tenants, register devices and add credentials. However, data can only be added but
, that the Hono developers keep watching. This FAQ page here will be removed soon.
Why do I get
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable

Road Map
Getting started with Eclipse Hono
This guide will walk you through an interactive example usage scenario of Eclipse Hono. You will learn how devices can use Hono’s protocol adapters to publish telemetry data and events using both HTTP and/or MQTT. You will also see how a downstream application can consume this data using Hono’s north bound API without requiring the application to know anything about the specifics of the communication protocols used by the devices.
Prerequisites for the Getting started Guide
This guide requires several tools to be installed on your computer. During the course of this guide, the devices publishing data will be represented by means of running some command line tools for posting HTTP requests and for publishing MQTT packets.

We do not collect nor share with third parties any of the data you provide when registering tenants, devices and credentials. We also do not inspect nor collect nor share with third parties any of the data your devices publish to the sandbox.
Play fair!
The sandbox’s computing resources are (quite) limited. The number of devices that can be registered per tenant is therefore limited to 100.
The sandbox will be running the latest Hono release or milestone (if available). However, we may also deploy a more recent nightly build without further notice.
In order to minimize the risk of collisions of device identities and credentials and to reduce the risk of others

non-trivial, hard-to-guess
tenant and device identifiers (e.g. a UUID).
The Apache Artemis instance we use for brokering events is configured with a maximum queue size of 1MB, i.e. you can only buffer up to 1 MB of events (per tenant) without having any consumer connected that actually processes the events. Once that limit is reached, no more events will be accepted by the protocol adapters for the corresponding tenant. In addition to that, events that are not consumed will automatically be removed from the queue(s) after five minutes.
The sandbox exposes its API endpoints on both a TLS secured as well as an unsecured port. The secure ports use a Let’s Encrypt certificate so you should not need to configure a specific trust store on your client in order to interact with them. Please note that when using the unsecured ports, the information you exchange with the sandbox might be exposed to eavesdroppers. We therefore
strongly suggest
that you use the secure ports only, if possible! When using the
Hono client
to access the sandbox’ Telemetry and/or Event APIs, make sure to not set a trust store explicitly but instead set the
tlsEnabled
property to
true
. The command line client binary is available from the
downloads page
and can be used to consume telemetry/event messages from the sandbox as below:

The Hono command line client is used in this guide for simulating an application that consumes telemetry data and events published by devices. The client is available from
Hono’s download page
. Note that running the command line client requires a Java 11 runtime environment being installed locally.
Very quick Quickstart
In the following all necessary commands and operations will be explained on how to register a tenant and a device via the HTTP API. Then, it will be shown how messages can be sent via the HTTP and MQTT protocol adapters. If you want to really kickstart your Hono experience there also is a convenience Python script which you can use to automatically replay the Tutorial given here (at least the telemetry part for now).
Python Quickstart
You can find the Python tutorial in the
Examples

Hono Sandbox
The most important prerequisite is, of course, a Hono instance that you can work with.
The most straightforward option to use for this guide is the
Hono Sandbox
which is running on infrastructure provided by the Eclipse Foundation and which is publicly accessible from the internet.
Using the Sandbox, there is no need to set up your own Hono instance locally. However, it requires several non-standard ports being accessible from your computer which may not be the case, e.g. if you are behind a firewall restricting internet access to a few standard ports only.
You can verify if you can access the relevant ports of the Sandbox by running the following command and comparing the output:
If you get output like this
you can use the Sandbox. Run the following commands to set some environment variables which will be used during the guide
and then proceed to the

AMQP Network
An
Apache Qpid Dispatch Router
instance that downstream applications connect to in order to consume telemetry data and events from devices.
An
Apache ActiveMQ Artemis
instance serving as the persistence store for events.
Monitoring Infrastructure
A
Prometheus
instance for storing metrics data from services and protocol adapters.
A
Grafana
instance providing a dash board visualizing the collected metrics data.
In the example scenario used in the remainder of this guide, the devices will connect to the HTTP and MQTT adapters in order to publish telemetry data and events. The devices will be authenticated using information stored in the Device Registry. The data is then forwarded downstream to the example application via the AMQP Messaging Network.
Registering Devices
When a device tries to connect to one of Hono’s protocol adapters, the protocol adapter first tries to authenticate the device using information kept in the Device Registry. The information maintained in the registry includes the

Connection Events
Hono’s protocol adapters can use
connection events
to indicate the connection status of a device. In particular, an adapter can notify downstream components about a newly established connection with a device or about a device having disconnected.
The connection status of devices using stateful protocols like MQTT and AMQP can usually be determined quite easily because these protocols often require peers to explicitly open or close a connection and often also support a kind of heart beat which can be used to determine if a connection is still alive. However, for stateless protocols like HTTP or CoAP, there is no clear definition of what it actually means that a device is

Device Provisioning
This page describes how devices are provisioned in Hono, i.e. how their digital representation is generated. For each device, registration information is stored that defines a device identity. Each device belongs to exactly one tenant. Each device must have at least one set of credentials that are used to authenticate to Hono.

identity

credentials
used by the device for authentication.
Before a device can connect to Hono and publish any data, the corresponding information needs to be added to the Device Registry.
Creating a new Tenant
Register a tenant using Hono’s Device Registry’s management HTTP API (a random tenant identifier will be generated):
Random tenant ID value
You will receive a randomly generated tenantId value. It will probably be different than the value given in this example. Make sure to export it to an environment variable to make the following steps easier:

connected
. It is obvious that a device is connected when it is sending an HTTP request. However, the adapter has no way of knowing if the device has gone to sleep after it has received the adapter’s response to its request.
That said, connection events indicating an established connection with a device can usually be taken as face value. However, connection events indicating the disconnection of a device may only represent the protocol adapters view of the device’s connection status. For example, the HTTP adapter might consider a device
disconnected
because it hasn’t received any requests from the device for some time. However, the device itself might as well be up and running (i.e. not sleeping) and simply have no data worth publishing.
The mechanism of firing connection events is pluggable with the default implementation simply forwarding connection status information to the logging framework. Hono also comes with an alternative implementation which forwards connection status information by means of
Connection Events
via the
Events
API.

> Resource limits
Connections Limit
Connection Duration Limit
Messages Limit
Resource limits
Resource limits such as the maximum number of device connections allowed per tenant or the allowed data volume of the messages over a period of time per tenant can be set in Hono.
Hono specifies an API
ResourceLimitChecks
that is used by the protocol adapters for the verification of the configured resource limits. A default implementation of this API is shipped with Hono. This default implementation uses the live metrics data retrieved from a Prometheus server to verify the resource-limits, if configured. To enable and use this default implementation, please refer to the protocol adapter admin guides. Based on the requirements, a custom version of the above API can be implemented and used. The resource-limits for a tenant can be set using the tenant configuration. Please refer to the
Tenant API
for more details.
Connections Limit
Before accepting a new connection request from a device, the number of existing connections is checked against the configured limit by the protocol adapters. The connection request is declined if the limit is exceeded.
The MQTT and AMQP protocol adapters keep the connections longer opened than their counterparts such as HTTP. Thereby the MQTT and AMQP adapters are enabled to check the connection limits before accepting any new connection to a device.

Request/Response
commands, there is always a response expected from the device.

Connecting Devices
One of the most important features of Eclipse Hono™ is to abstract away the specific communication protocols used by devices. This page describes the different ways of how devices can be connected to Hono.
Before a device can connect to Hono and upload data or receive commands from downstream applications, it needs to be
provisioned
to the system. As part of device provisioning, the device is associated with the
tenant
that it belongs to and gets assigned a logical identifier which is unique within the tenant.
Devices can be generally partitioned into two groups: devices which natively support the Internet Protocol (IP) for communication and devices that don’t.
Devices falling into the former group can connect to Hono directly using any of the IP based protocols supported by Hono’s protocol adapters. Devices from the latter group often use radio based or serial line communication protocols that are limited to a local area and require a
gateway
in order to connect to one of Hono’s protocol adapters via IP.
The diagram below shows a device that supports the MQTT protocol and connects directly to Hono’s MQTT protocol adapter and another device that uses Bluetooth LE for connecting locally to a gateway which then connects to Hono’s MQTT adapter.
Connecting to a Protocol Adapter directly
The most straight forward scenario is a device connecting to one of Hono’s protocol adapters directly via IP based network infrastructure. For this to work, the device needs to use a communication protocols supported by one of the adapters and needs to be able to use the resource endpoints exposed by that particular protocol adapter as described in its
user guide
.
In this case the connected device’s identity will be resolved as part of authentication during connection establishment. For this to work, a set of credentials needs to be provisioned for the device which needs to be appropriate for usage with one of the adapter’s supported authentication schemes.

To get an understanding of what is meant by the terms
tenant
,
device registration
and
credentials
, it is recommended to read the
Device Identity
page first.
So in order to use a device with Hono, it has to be provisioned. This means that registration information and at least one credential record must be stored in the device registry.
There are different ways to perform device provisioning.

I have created
#2241
in order to resolve the problem with the unit test. Does this resolve the issue with the JDBC registry PR?
Jens Reimann
@ctron
i think it should … however, I think it makes more sense to add some kind of method
deviceRegistryOnlyReturnsValidEntries() -> bool
and take the value of that to test for either 1 or 2 expected entries
for JDBC that should return
true
, for all others
false
because in the future, no one will remember why either 1 or 2 is "ok" for this test :)

HTTP Adapter
Before accepting a new connection request from a device, the overall amount of time that the devices have already been connected to protocol adapters for that tenant is checked against the configured limit by the protocol adapters. The connection request is declined if the connection duration limit has been already reached. This limit is only supported by protocol adapters that maintain
connection state
with authenticated devices. In particular, the HTTP adapter does not support this metric.
The default Prometheus based implementation uses connection duration as the factor to limit the connections. This default implementation supports two modes of connection duration limit calculation namely
days
and
monthly
. For more details on how to set the mode refer to the
Tenant API
. If the period is not set explicitly, then the mode is assumed as
monthly
in the default implementation.
In the
monthly
mode, further device connections are only allowed, if the overall amount of time that the devices have already been connected from the beginning till the end of the current (Gregorian) calendar month does not exceed the configured
max-minutes
value. But for the first month, on which the connection duration limit became effective, the

General concept
The following sequence diagram gives an overview of a device indicating its availability for receiving commands, of a business application sending a command to the device and of the device sending back a command response.
The application and the adapter connect to the AMQP Network, which forwards the transfer - for clarity this is not shown in the diagram below.
Request/Response Command overview
In (1) the device subscribes for commands (if connecting to the AMQP or MQTT adapter) or indicates that it will stay connected for a given amount of time to receive a command (if connecting to the HTTP adapter), using the
ttd
(“time till disconnect”) parameter.
The protocol adapter will then create the necessary AMQP consumer link with the AMQP messaging network if it doesn’t exist already (for more details see
below
) and will send a
notification
to the application that the device is ready to receive commands (2).
After having created a sender link on the
command/TENANT
address, the application can then send commands, with the target device given in the AMQP message
to
address

can notify an application about the fact that a device is connected and ready to receive one or more commands by means of including a
time ‘til disconnect
(
ttd
) property in telemetry or event messages.
The
ttd
property value indicates the time that the device will stay connected to the protocol adapter. Using this value together with the
creation-time
of the message, an application can determine whether an attempt to send a command to the device has a reasonable chance of succeeding. The
ttd
property can be included in any regular telemetry or event message. However, if a device does not have any telemetry data or event to upload to the adapter, it can also use an
empty notification
instead.
Hono includes utility classes that application developers can use to register a callback to be notified when a device sends a
ttd
notification. See Hono’s example module for details where such a notification callback is used. Please refer to the

In some cases, a device may not be able to directly connect to one of Hono’s protocol adapters. An example is a device that uses a serial bus or radio waves for local communication. Such devices can be connected to a protocol adapter by means of a
device gateway
which acts on behalf of the device(s) when communicating with Hono. A device gateway is often implemented as a (small) hardware box close to the devices, running some gateway software which translates hence and forth between the device and one of Hono’s protocol adapters.
From the perspective of a protocol adapter, the gateway looks just like any other device having its own device identity and credentials.
The following diagram illustrates how a gateway publishes data on behalf of a device that uses Bluetooth for local communication with the gateway.
The device establishes a Bluetooth connection with the gateway.
The gateway sends an MQTT CONNECT packet to Hono’s MQTT adapter to establish an MQTT connection. The packet contains the gateway’s credentials.
The MQTT adapter determines the tenant from the
username
contained in the CONNECT packet and retrieves the hashed password that is on record for the gateway from the Credentials service.
The Credentials service returns the hashed password.
The MQTT adapter checks the password and accepts the connection request.
The device sends some sensor readings via Bluetooth to the gateway.
The gateway forwards the sensor data in an MQTT PUBLISH packet to the MQTT adapter. The topic name contains the identifier of the device that the gateway acts on behalf of.
The MQTT adapter invokes the Device Registration service’s
assert Device Registration
operation to check if the gateway is authorized to act on behalf of the device.

If the desired
tenant
does not yet exist, it must be created first. How to do this is described in the tenants section of the
Device Registry Management API
.
The actual Device Provisioning is then performed by adding devices as described under devices section of the
Device Registry Management API
. This creates both a device identity and an (empty) credentials record. The last step is to add real credentials as described in the credentials section of the
Device Registry Management API
.
Automatic Device Provisioning
The term
Auto-Provisioning
denotes a feature of Hono where the Device Registry automatically generates the credentials and registration information for a device the first time it connects. Auto-Provisioning is supported by Hono’s protocol adapters for devices that authenticate with client certificates. The feature can be enabled per certificate authority (CA) at the tenant.
Prerequisites
Hono does not require a specific Device Registry implementation, but only specifies a set of APIs that must be provided by a compatible implementation. Since the main part of the

Publishing Telemetry Data to the HTTP Adapter
Now that the downstream application is running, devices can start publishing telemetry data and events using Hono’s protocol adapters. First, you will simulate a device publishing data to Hono using the HTTP protocol. Go back to the original terminal and run:
If you have started the downstream application as described above, you should now see the telemetry message being logged to the application’s console in the other terminal. The output should look something like this:
You can publish more data simply by re-running the
curl
command above with arbitrary payload.
Service Unavailable
When you invoke the command above for the first time, you may get the following response:
This is because the first request to publish data for a given tenant is used as the trigger to establish a tenant specific sender link with the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network to forward the data over. However, the HTTP adapter may not receive credits quickly enough for the request to be served immediately. You can simply ignore this response and re-submit the command.
If you haven’t started the application you will always get
503 Resource Unavailable
responses because Hono does not accept any telemetry data from devices if there aren’t any consumers connected that are interested in the data. The reason for this is that Hono
never
persists Telemetry data and thus it doesn’t make any sense to accept and process telemetry data if there is no consumer to deliver it to.
The HTTP Adapter also supports publishing telemetry messages using
at least once
delivery semantics. For information on how that works and additional examples for interacting with Hono via HTTP, please refer to the

is calculated based on the
max-minutes
with respect to the remaining days in that month from the
effective-since
date.
Below is a sample resource limit configuration for a tenant, where it has been defined that the connection duration limit became effective on 10.Jul.2019 and the maximum connection duration limit for every month is 50,000 minutes. It means that from August 2019, the connection limit check ensures that no more connections are allowed for that tenant, if that limit of 50,000 minutes is already reached. But in case of July 2019, the month on which the message limit became effective, the
effective connection duration limit
is calculated by finding the average limit for a day from the configured
max-minutes
and then multiplying it with the number of days from the
effective-since
date till the end of that month. In this case it is calculated as
(50,000 minutes / 31 days) x 22 days
, which is 35,483 minutes. It means that for the month of July 2019, no more new connections are allowed, if the limit of 35,843 minutes is already reached.

Implement a Custom Hono HTTP Protocol Adapter
Eclipse Hono™ comes with a default
HTTP Adapter
which can be used to interact with devices via HTTP. The default HTTP Adapter also serves as a blueprint for implementing a
custom
HTTP protocol adapter.
This section will guide you through the steps to build your own custom HTTP protocol adapter.
Prerequisites
You should be familiar with the setup and start of Hono. Refer to the
Getting Started
guide.
The standard HTTP Adapter
Hono’s HTTP Adapter supports telemetry and event data processing. Please refer to the
HTTP Adapter User Guide
and
command/TENANT/4711
(3). If a command response is expected, the command response address
(with
replyId
being an arbitrary identifier chosen by the application) is to be set as
reply-to
property in the command message and a corresponding receiver link is to be opened by the application. For one-way commands, both is to be omitted.
After receiving the command, the protocol adapter instance will forward the command to the device (4) and send a disposition update back to the application (5).
In case of a Request/Response command, the device can then send a command response (6) that will be forwarded by the protocol adapter back to the application (7).
Command & Control involving a gateway
Hono has special support for sending commands to devices that are connected via a gateway to Hono. Such devices are configured in the Hono device registration service in such a way, that certain gateways may act on behalf of the device.
When sending commands, the northbound applications do not have to know to which gateway the command target device is connected to. The application sends the command with the device address and Hono will direct the command to a gateway that has subscribed for such commands and that is configured to act on behalf of the command target device. If there are multiple matching gateways, the one that the command target device was last connected to is chosen. The information about which gateways are subscribed and which gateway a device has last communicated by is managed via the
device connection service
.
Command consumer links in the protocol adapter
The protocol adapter opens 2 kinds of consumer links to receive commands.

Consuming Messages from Java
To illustrate how Eclipse Hono™ can be integrated with Java code, a simple application is provided that consumes telemetry and event data for devices belonging to the default tenant.
It also includes support for Command and Control:
if indicated by a received downstream message that contains a
ttd
value (refer to
Device notifications
for details) it tries to send a command to the device. If the value of
ttd
indicates that the device stays connected for an unlimited time (
ttd == -1
), the application will periodically repeat to send a command until notified the device is disconnected again (
ttd == 0
).
This application shall serve as a blueprint to integrate your existing java source code with Hono. Its code is found in the
example
module in the package
.
The factory provides methods to get a receiver for receiving commands and a sender for each of the following actions:
send a telemetry message
send an event message
send a response to a previously received command
Do not re-use sender instances
The senders manage the underlying AMQP sender links, which are restored after temporary interruption of the connection (
HonoConnection
manages the automatic reconnection). To achieve this, a caching mechanism is used, so that defective links are replaced by new ones. The sender must be always retrieved from the factory when sending because otherwise the link might no longer exist. So, do not hold references to sender objects and re-use them for subsequent send operations!
For examples of how to use the client, see the example implementation in the
AmqpExampleDevice
class.
Usage in a Gateway
There are two ways to subscribe to commands for use in a gateway:
Gateway subscribing for commands for a specific device: The gateway subscribes individually for each connected device by creating a command consumer for the specific device.
Gateway subscribing for commands for all its devices: The gateway subscribes for commands sent to all the different devices that the gateway acts on behalf of by creating a command consumer that is not scoped on a specific device.

Monitoring & Tracing
When a device uploads telemetry data to the HTTP adapter, the adapter invokes operations on the Device Registration, Credentials and the Tenant services in order to authenticate and authorize the device before sending the telemetry data downstream to the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network. The overall success of this process and the latency involved before the message reaches the consumer is determined by the individual interactions between the service components.
Monitoring
In a production environment, an operations team will usually want to keep track of some
key performance indicators
(KPI) which allow the team to determine the overall
health
of the system, e.g. memory and CPU consumption etc. Hono supports the tracking of such KPIs by means of metrics it can be configured to report. The metrics are usually collected in a time series database like

The value indicates the number of seconds that the device will stay connected. Devices using a stateless protocol like HTTP will be able to receive a single command only before disconnecting.

The device is now connected (i.e. available to receive upstream messages) until further notice.
AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network Configuration
The
Qpid Dispatch Router
, together with the
Apache Artemis
message broker, serves as the default
AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network
that is used in Hono’s example deployment as described in the
Deployment Guides
.
The Dispatch Router component exposes service endpoints implementing the
north bound
part of Hono’s
Telemetry
,
Event
and
The Device Registration service confirms the gateway’s authorization.
The MQTT adapter accepts the sensor data from the gateway and forwards it downstream.
Note that the device itself is not authenticated by the MQTT adapter in this case. The responsibility for establishing and verifying the device identity lies with the gateway in this setup. It is therefore not necessary to provision credentials for the devices to Hono.
The
Device Registry Management API
’s
/devices
resource can be used to register gateways and devices. The gateways that are authorized to act on behalf of a device can be set by means of the device’s
via
and
viaGroups
properties. This is useful in cases where a device may
roam
among multiple gateways.
When sending commands to a device, Hono needs to determine which of the authorized gateways should be used to forward the command message to the device. For this purpose, Hono’s protocol adapters keep track of the
last known gateway
which has acted on behalf of each device by means of the

Step 1: Configure the Tenant
The CA to be used by the devices needs to be configured. The following tasks must be performed:

Publishing Events to the HTTP Adapter
In a similar way you can upload events:
Again, you should see the event being logged to the console of the downstream application.
Publishing Telemetry Data to the MQTT Adapter
Devices can also publish data to Hono using the MQTT protocol. If you have installed the
mosquitto_pub
command line client, you can run the following command to publish arbitrary telemetry data to Hono’s MQTT adapter using QoS 0:
Again, you should now see the telemetry message being logged to console of the downstream application.
The MQTT Adapter also supports publishing telemetry messages using QoS 1. For information on how that works and additional examples for interacting with Hono via MQTT, please refer to the

Messages Limit
Hono supports limiting the number of messages that devices and north bound applications of a tenant can publish to Hono during a given time interval. Before accepting any telemetry or event or command messages from devices or north bound applications, it is checked by the protocol adapters that if the message limit is exceeded or not. The incoming message is discarded if the limit is exceeded.
The default Prometheus based implementation uses data volume as the factor to limit the messages. The data volume already consumed by a tenant over the given time interval is compared with the configured message limit before accepting any messages. The default implementation supports two modes of message limits calculation namely
days
and
monthly
. For more details on how to set the mode refer to the

Anatomy of the standard HTTP Adapter
Like many other Hono components, the HTTP Adapter is built on top of the

framework.

Adding Routes
.
This is the link address used by applications to send commands. Upon receiving a command message on this link, the protocol adapter checks whether the command target device id needs to be mapped to a gateway. Furthermore it is checked to which particular protocol adapter instance the target device (or mapped gateway) is actually connected. Since this kind of link is opened from all protocol adapter instances receiving commands for the tenant, a command message is first received by any one of these protocol adapter instances. Therefore, if necessary, the command will be delegated to the adapter instance that is connected to the target device or to the gateway receiving commands for the device. That is done by forwarding the command to the AMQP messaging network on a link with the address
(see below).
A link per protocol adapter instance on the address
.
On this link, commands will be received that have been forwarded from another protocol adapter instance. This link address is only used for communication between protocol adapter instances, so attaching to this link address should not be enabled for applications.
Example with multiple adapters involved
The following diagrams show the message flow if the command message is first received on a protocol adapter instance that the target device is
not
connected to.
Command subscription
In the scenario here there is a protocol adapter instance #2 through which a command subscription for the example tenant was already made (0).
The device subscribes for commands (1) and the protocol adapter creates the receiver link (2) on the tenant-scoped link. The protocol adapter then updates the
command-handling protocol adapter instance for device

In Hono version 1.0 we dropped the OpenShift specific deployment using the source-to-image (S2I) model, in favor of the Helm charts and the Eclipse IoT Packages project.
You can still deploy to OpenShift and OKD, using the Helm charts. And you can also use
routes
to expose services. Deploying using S2I is also still possible, however the Hono project simply no longer provides out-of-the box scripts for doing so.

The provided classes are kept as simple as possible (in the tradition of a classical “Hello World” implementation) while still covering the most relevant messaging patterns (downstream and upstream messages). For this purpose they make use of simple constant definitions and deal with exceptions as rarely as possible. You may want to change the level of detail that should be logged to the console by editing the contained
resources/logback.xml
file.
Please refer to the javadoc of the classes for details.
Note
Note that production ready code likely has to think more about error handling and logging than this simple blueprint.
Configure the example
For simplicity, all configurations are defined as Java constants inside the class
HonoExampleConstants
.
If you have Hono running in Docker under
localhost
, the example should work out of the box.
Some configuration values can be overridden by providing them as property to the application.
This includes the
host
Subscribing for all devices does not work if multiple instances of the gateway are running at the same time, because a command is only sent to one receiver, and this may be an instance that has no connection to the device. On the other hand, subscribing for a specific device once it connects to the gateway instance (and closing the subscription once it disconnects) may not work for device-oriented protocols that are not connection-based.
Tracing
The AMQP Adapter Client supports tracing of the messages with
OpenTracing
. To use tracing, each of the senders returned by the factory can be cast to an interface with the same name and the prefix “Traceable” (e.g. cast
TelemetrySender
to
TraceableTelemetrySender
). The traceable interfaces provide
send
methods with an additional
SpanContext
parameter.

or

and then visualized on a monitoring dash-board built using frameworks like
Grafana
. Such a dash-board can usually also be configured to send alarms when certain thresholds are exceeded.
Metrics usually provide insights into the past and current status of an individual component. The values can be aggregated to provide a picture of the overall system’s status. As such, metrics provide a great way to
monitor
system health and, in particular, to anticipate resource shortages and use such knowledge to pro-actively prevent system failure.
Configuring a Metrics Back End
Hono uses
Micrometer
for providing metrics. It is possible to drop in any Micrometer compatible back end. Hono also uses the Micrometer integration with Spring Boot and Vert.x.
Please refer to the
Micrometer documentation
for details regarding the configuration of a specific Micrometer back end. In most cases, you only need to add the back end specific jar files to the class path and add back end specific configuration to the
application.yml
file.
etc., and the clients attaching to Hono in order to send and receive data all communicate with each other using AMQP 1.0 over TCP. The Hono components and the clients will usually not be located on the same local network but will probably communicate over public networking infrastructure. For most use cases it is therefore desirable, if not necessary, to provide for confidentiality of the data being transferred between these components. This section describes how Hono supports confidentiality by means of
Transport Layer Security
(TLS) and how to configure it.
Enabling TLS
All of Hono’s components can be configured to use TLS for establishing an encrypted communication channel with peers. When a client initiates a connection with a server, the TLS handshake protocol is used to negotiate parameters of a secure channel to be used for exchanging data. The most important of those parameters is a secret (symmetric) encryption key that is only known to the client and the server and which is used to transparently encrypt all data being sent over the connection as long as the connection exists. With each new connection, a new secret key is negotiated.
Using TLS in this way requires configuring the server component with a cryptographic
private/public key
pair and a
certificate
which
binds
an
identity claim
to the public key. It is out of scope of this document to describe the full process of creating such a key pair and acquiring a corresponding certificate. The
demo-certs
module already contains a set of keys and certificates to be used for evaluation and demonstration purposes. Throughout the rest of this section we will use these keys and certificates . Please refer to the
demo-certs/README.md
file for details regarding how to create your own keys and certificates.

The device is now disconnected (i.e. not available anymore to receive upstream messages).
Determining a Device’s Connection Status
An application receiving a downstream message containing a
ttd
property can check if the device is currently connected (and thus ready to receive a command) by
adding the
ttd
value to the
creation-time
to determine the
expiration
time, and then

APIs which are used by applications to interact with devices.
Dispatch Router Configuration
The Dispatch Router is part of the
Apache Qpid project
. Hono uses Dispatch Router by means of the
EnMasse
project’s
Dispatch Router Docker image
created from the Qpid project source code.
The Dispatch Router can be configured by means of configuration files. Hono includes an example configuration in the
deploy/src/main/config/qpid
folder which is used by the example deployment scripts. Please refer to the
Dispatch Router documentation
for details regarding the configuration file format and options.
Artemis Broker Configuration
The Artemis Broker is part of the
Apache ActiveMQ project
Device Connection API
.
Gateway Groups
In larger deployments with many gateways it can become cumbersome to list all possible gateways in the
via
property of each device explicitly. This becomes even more of a burden when gateways are added and/or removed frequently. To help with such situations it is possible to define groups of gateways using Hono’s Device Registry Management API.
A gateway group can be defined implicitly by means of adding the group’s identifier to the list in the
memberOf
property of a (gateway) device that should belong to the group. The gateway group ID can then be added to the
viaGroups
property of those devices that all gateways in the gateway group are authorized to act on behalf of.
Note that the Device Registration API, which is used by protocol adapters to verify if a gateway may act on behalf of a device, has no notion of gateway groups. Thus, the response message of the Device Registration API’s

Device Authentication
. First, the Tenant API is queried. If the Tenant configuration returned contains the CA used for authentication and the feature is switched on for this CA, the protocol adapter assumes that automatic provisioning must be performed. It puts the device’s certificate into the query to enable the device registry to do the provisioning.
If the Device Registry does not find any credentials for the device, it takes the information from the client certificate to create both credentials and device registration data for it.
The Device Registry is expected to perform the following steps:
Generate a unique device-id
Create device
Create credentials
Optional: Provision device in external systems
The newly created credentials are returned to the protocol adapter in the response as if they had been present before.
The following query of the Device Registration API returns the previously generated registration data.
The provisioning is, of course, a one-time action, on subsequent connections the APIs simply return the stored records.

Great, then I guess you should go ahead and merge the PR :-)
You have successfully connected a device to Hono and published sensor data for consumption by an application connected to Hono’s north bound API. The application used the AMQP 1.0 protocol to receive messages regardless of the transport protocol used by the device to publish the data.

Tenant API
. If the period is not set explicitly, then the mode is assumed as
monthly
in the default implementation.
In the
monthly
mode, the message limit check ensures that the data usage from the beginning till the end of a (Gregorian) calendar month does not exceed the
max-bytes
value. But for the first month on which the message limit became effective, the
effective max-bytes
are calculated based on the
max-bytes
with respect to the remaining days in that month from the
effective-since
date.
Below is a sample resource limit configuration for a tenant and it has been defined that the message limit became effective on 10.Jul.2019 and the maximum bytes allowed for a month is 2 GB. It means that from August 2019, the message limit check ensures that the data usage in a month does not exceed 2 GB. But in case of July 2019, the month on which the message limit became effective, the
effective max-bytes
is calculated by finding the average limit for a day from the

Future Approach
Authentication/Authorization
This page describes how authentication and authorization of devices, consumers (back end applications) and system components works in Hono.
Requirements
Devices are authenticated and authorized when they connect to a protocol adapter.
Consumers are authenticated and authorized when they connect to a
Dispatch Router
instance.
System components are authenticated and authorized when they connect to each other.
Credentials and authorization rules can be managed centrally, i.e. credentials and rules do not need to be configured manually on each component.
How it works today
The following diagram provides an overview of the components involved in use cases requiring authentication and authorization.
Device Auth
Both the HTTP adapter as well as the MQTT adapter require devices to authenticate during connection establishment by default. Both rely on the
Credentials API
to help in verifying credentials provided by a device. Please refer to
Device Authentication
In Vert.x, a
route
is a mapping of an HTTP request to a
handler
. Inside a route, Vert.x provides a
RoutingContext
instance which gives access to the HTTP request (and response) object containing the HTTP headers.
The standard HTTP Adapter overrides the abstract method
addRoutes()
, provided by the base class, and adds routes for processing telemetry data and events.
The route for telemetry data parses the HTTP request, extracts the
tenant
and
deviceId
parameters from the request URL path, and forwards the message payload to the method
uploadTelemetryMessage()
, provided by the base class.
NB
information (3), assigning the device 4711 to adapter instance id #1. Following that, the notification about the device subscription is sent to the application via the AMQP messaging network (4).
Command handling
Upon receiving the notification, the application prepares sender and command response receiver links (1,2) and sends the command message to the AMQP messaging network. Here it is received by protocol adapter instance #2. The protocol adapter then queries the
command-handling protocol adapter instances
information for the device id of the command message (4). In this case here, the protocol adapter instance #1 is returned (5). The command then gets forwarded to the AMQP messaging network on the address for adapter instance #1 (6). The protocol adapter instance #1 will receive the message (7) and forward it to the device (8). As the last step, an “accepted” disposition will be sent back to the application (9).
Command response handling
The command response message is sent back to the application from the protocol adapter via the AMQP messaging network.
Gateway subscriptions
Gateway subscribing for commands for a particular device
The following sequence diagrams show the different steps involved in having a gateway subscribe for commands of a particular device.
Command subscription
The gateway “gw-1” is connected to a protocol adapter and subscribes to commands for a device 4711 (1). This device has to be configured so that the gateway may act on its behalf (see
Configuring Gateway Devices
for details).
The protocol adapter creates the tenant-scoped consumer link on the

Limiting the Data Volume
Limiting Resource Usage
Deploying Eclipse Hono™ to a container orchestration platform is easy thanks to the provided Docker images. This page provides some guidance for configuring the resource consumption of these containers in order to make sure that they get enough memory and CPU to run properly, but to also make sure that individual containers do not use up all the resources causing other containers to starve.
Docker itself provides means to limit a container’s consumption of memory and CPU resources by means of command line options that can be set when starting up a container. Both Kubernetes and OpenShift leverage this mechanism when defining resource limits of a
pod
. Please refer to the corresponding documentation of Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift for details regarding the particular syntax to be used.
Java’s View of the World
Hono’s service components are implemented in Java. When the corresponding Docker container for such a service is started, the only process being run inside the container is therefore a Java virtual machine (JVM). On startup, the JVM tries to determine the amount of memory and the number of CPU cores that it can use to execute workloads. By default the JVM queries the operating system for the corresponding parameters and adjusts its runtime parameters accordingly, e.g. it will by default limit the size of its heap memory to a quarter of the total memory available in order to leave enough memory for other processes running on the same system.
This is a reasonable approach when running on
bare metal
or a VM where other processes are expected to be running on the same machine, thus competing for the same computing resources. However, containers are usually configured to run a single process only so that it makes more sense to dedicate almost all of the available resources to running that process, leaving the (small) rest for the operating system itself.
As described above, a Docker container can easily be configured with a limit for memory and CPU resources that it may use during runtime. These limits are set and enforced using Linux
CGroups
.
Limiting a Component’s Memory Consumption
Starting with Java 9, the JVM will correctly determine the total memory and number of CPUs available when running inside of a container. All of the Docker images provided by Hono run with OpenJDK 11 by default, thus ensuring that the JVM considers any memory limits configured for the container when configuring its heap during startup. However, the default algorithm will still only allocate a quarter of the (limited) amount of memory, thus leaving a lot of memory available to the container unused.
The following JVM options can be used in Java 9 and later in order to change this behavior:
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
Protocol Adapter Metrics
Minimum Message Size
Service Metrics
Metrics
Eclipse Hono™’s components report several metrics which may be used to gain some insight into the running system. For instance, the HTTP adapter reports the number of successfully processed telemetry messages. Some of these metrics are considered part of Hono’s external interface. This section describes the semantics and format of the metrics, how they can be retrieved and how to interpret actual values.
Reported Metrics
Hono uses
Micrometer
in combination with Spring Boot to internally collect metrics. Those metrics can be exported to different back ends. Please refer to

and the

of the AMQP network. In the standard setup of Hono they should be configured to the
qdrouter
from the Apache Qpid project. In production scenarios this might be a large setup of AMQP routers, brokers, etc.

to find out which part of the application can be configured by properties.

The Hono build supports configuration of a specific metrics back end by means of Maven profiles. The following build profiles are currently supported:
metrics-prometheus
– Enables the Prometheus backend.
metrics-graphite
– Enables the Graphite backend.
metrics-influxdb
– Enables the InfluxDB backend.
Additionally, to selecting a metrics back end, you may need to configure the back end using Spring configuration options. See the documentation mentioned above for more information.
Note that none of the above profiles are active by default, i.e. you need to explicitly activate one of them when starting the build using Maven’s
-p
command line parameter.
Using Prometheus
Most of the metrics back ends have data being
pushed
to from the components reporting the metrics. However, Prometheus is different in that it

Within a Hono installation the following communication channels can be secured with TLS:

Device Registry
connecting to
Auth Server
- The Device Registry connects to the Auth Server in order to verify client credentials and determine the client’s authorities. This (internal) connection can (should) be secured by configuring the Auth Server and Device Registry for TLS.
Protocol Adapter

Device Registry
- A protocol adapter connects to the Device Registry in order to retrieve assertions regarding the registration status of devices. This (internal) connection can be secured by configuring the protocol adapter and the Device Registry for TLS.

Source of the

While it seems to be natural that a device itself indicates when it is ready to receive a command, it may not always be possible or desirable to do so. A device could e.g. be not capable to specify the value for
ttd
in it’s message, or all devices of a particular setup would always use the same value for
ttd
, so it would not make much sense to provide this value always again. Additionally different protocols may or may not let a sender set specific values for a message, so a device using a specific protocol may not be able to provide a value for the

contain the IDs of gateway groups in its
via
property but instead contains the IDs of all (gateway) devices that are a member of any of the authorized gateway groups.
Note
Hono’s example device registry does not support nested gateway groups.
Connecting via a Protocol Gateway
Hono already comes with a set of standard protocol adapters which support the most widely used (IP based) IoT protocols like HTTP, MQTT and AMQP 1.0. Devices using one of these protocols might be able to directly connect to the corresponding adapter as described in the previous section. However, even if the device supports MQTT it might still not be possible to connect to the MQTT adapter because the device expects to use a topic structure that differs from the one employed by the MQTT adapter. In other cases devices might use a proprietary, highly optimized, binary (IP based) protocol for communication with back end infrastructure.
Hono supports connecting such devices to one of the standard protocol adapters by means of a
protocol gateway
. A protocol gateway is a software service which translates hence and forth between the device’s proprietary protocol and the protocol used by the Hono protocol adapter. This concept is very similar to the
device gateway
described above. The main difference is that a protocol gateway is usually deployed in the back end (close to the protocol adapter) whereas a device gateway is usually deployed close to the devices that are connected to the gateway using a mechanism that is usually constrained to a local area.
The diagram below illustrates how two devices use a proprietary IP based protocol to connect to a protocol gateway in the back end which in turn is connected to Hono’s standard AMQP 1.0 protocol adapter.
The devices publish data to the
protocol gateway
using the proprietary IP based protocol. The gateway then puts the data into AMQP 1.0 messages and forwards them to the Hono AMQP adapter using the AMQP 1.0 protocol.
The requirements and prerequisites for this approach are the same as those for the standard device gateway scenario. Authentication and authorization of gateways works in the same way.

for a general overview of Hono’s approach to authenticating devices and to the
protocol adapter user guides
for specifics regarding how devices can authenticate to the corresponding protocol adapters.
System Component Auth
Client components opening an AMQP connection to a server component are authenticated using SASL PLAIN as specified in
RFC 4422
. The server component takes the authentication information provided by the client component and opens a connection to the
Auth Server
, using the credentials provided by the client in its SASL PLAIN exchange with the server component. On successful authentication the
Auth Server
issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) asserting the client’s identity and its granted authorities to the server component. The server component then
attaches
this token to its AMQP connection with the client and from then on uses it to make authorization decisions regarding the client’s requests. See
Authentication API
for details regarding the authentication process and the format of the tokens issued by the
Auth Server
.
Note the Vert.x place holder indicators
:
inside the URL path pattern
/telemetry/:%s/:%s
. Vert.x makes matching place holders available as request parameters. See
Capturing path parameters
in the Vert.x documentation.
The route for events looks very similar to the route for telemetry data. It forwards the event message payload to the
uploadEventMessage()
method.
Please refer to the
Telemetry API
and
Event API
command/TENANT
address (if it doesn’t already exist) (2) and then updates the
command-handling protocol adapter instance for device
information (3), assigning the device 4711 to adapter instance id #1.
Just like it is done when a protocol adapter handles any kind of message from a gateway acting on behalf of a device, the protocol adapter updates the
last-known gateway
information here, sending a request to the device connection service (4). The notification event is then sent containing the device id 4711 (5)
Command handling
After the application has prepared the sender and consumer links (1,2), it sends the command message on the
command/TENANT
link with the AMQP message
to

as the metrics back end.
When deploying to Kubernetes/OpenShift, the metrics reported by Hono may contain environment specific tags (like the
pod
name) which are added by the Prometheus scraper. However, those tags are not part of the Hono metrics definition.
Hono applications may report other metrics in addition to the ones defined here. In particular, all components report metrics regarding the JVM’s internal state, e.g. memory consumption and garbage collection status. Those metrics are not considered part of Hono’s
official
metrics definition. However, all those metrics will still contain tags as described below.
Common Metrics
Tags for common metrics are:

Description
Telemetry and Event messages
Depending on the logger configuration, all received downstream messages are printed to the console.
Please note that consumers do not connect with Hono directly, but rather with an AMQP router network.
Command and Control
By using a helper class provided by Hono, a callback in the application code is invoked when a downstream message was received that signals the device will stay connected to the protocol adapter for some time (see
Device notifications
for details).
Inside this callback an arbitrary simple command is sent down to the device (once or periodically) and the response is logged to the console.
Encryption of communication
For the encrypted communication with Hono, the necessary truststore is already installed and used by the Hono client.
If you want to integrate the code with your own software, please copy the provided truststore (
hono/demo-certs/certs/trusted-certs.pem
) from the Hono project to the
resources
directory of your project and adopt the code pointing to the file location.
) all components periodically for new metrics data. For this to work, the Prometheus server needs to be configured with the IP addresses of the components to monitor. In the example deployment that comes with Hono, the Prometheus server is configured with the names of the Kubernetes services corresponding to the Hono components that it should scrape. The components themselves need to expose a corresponding HTTP endpoint that the Prometheus server can connect to for scraping the meter data. All Hono components that report metrics can be configured to expose such an endpoint via their
Health Check
server
which already exposes endpoints for determining the component’s readiness and liveness status.
Health Check Server Configuration
All of Hono’s service components and protocol adapters contain a
Health Check
server which can be configured to expose several HTTP endpoints for determining the component’s status. In particular, the server exposes a
/readiness
, a
/liveness
and an optional
/prometheus
URI endpoint.
The former two endpoints are supposed to be used by container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to monitor the runtime status of the containers that it manages. These endpoints are
always
Protocol Adapter
- Devices use TLS to both authenticate the protocol adapter and to establish an encrypted channel that provides integrity and privacy when transmitting data. Note that the specifics of if and how TLS can be used with a particular protocol adapter is specific to the transport protocol the adapter uses for communicating with the devices.
Liveness/readiness probes
connecting to
Service Health Checks
- Systems like Kubernetes are periodically checking the health status of the individual services . This communication can be secured by configuring the health check of the individual services to expose a secure endpoint.
Auth Server
The Auth Server supports the use of TLS for connections to clients. Please refer to the
Auth Server admin guide
for details regarding the required configuration steps.
The
demo-certs/certs
folder includes the following demo keys and certificates to be used with the Auth Server for that purpose.

ttd
:
Hono’s Tenant and Device Registration APIs support the inclusion of default values for application-properties in the AMQP 1.0 message. By these means a device can be configured to always have a specific value for
ttd
.
In a future extension there may be a configuration value per tenant and protocol adapter that sets the value of
ttd
if it was not provided by other means already (like provided to the protocol adapter or by setting a default value).
Hono’s HTTP protocol adapter
Hono’s HTTP protocol adapter supports the setting of the
ttd
value in requests explicitly - please refer to the
HTTP Adapter
for details. Alternatively the default property values for devices from the Device Registry can be used (described above).
Hono’s MQTT protocol adapter
The repository
hono-extras
contains a generic template for an MQTT protocol gateway. This template allows you to develop a production-ready protocol gateway with minimal effort, with which you can connect existing MQTT-enabled devices to Hono. For example, you can use other topic names or structures, or you can transform, enrich, compress, or encrypt the payload.
Example Code
Hono’s
examples
module
contains code for a simple protocol gateway illustrating how devices using a binary TCP based protocol can be connected to Hono’s AMQP adapter.

, which enables a different mode of the Command Line Client.
The client will prompt you to enter the command’s name, the payload to send and the payload’s content type. The example below illustrates how a one-way command to set the volume with a JSON payload is sent to the device.
In the terminal for the simulated device you should see the received command as follows
Sending a Response to a Command
Now that you have sent a one-way command to the device, you may get to know
request/response
commands where the device sends a response to the application. A
request/response
command received from an application contains an identifier that is unique to each new command. The device must include this identifier in its response so that the application can correctly correlate the response with the request.
Hono supports devices communicating via common IoT protocols like HTTP, MQTT, AMQP and CoAP out of the box.
Messaging Patterns
Hono provides APIs for important IoT communication patterns:
Telemetry
and
Event
messages can be used by devices to report sensor readings whereas applications can use
Command & Control
to invoke operations on devices.
Secure
Hono is designed for security by default. It supports common authentication mechanisms like username/password and X.509 client certificates to verify a device’s identity and uses transport layer security (TLS) when communicating with devices.
Extensible
Your device uses a custom protocol? Hono provides a simple mechanism to add custom protocol adapters.

Based on the components shown above, the following sequence diagram shows how the
MQTT Adapter
connects to the
Device Registry
and gets authenticated transparently using the
Auth Server
.
Client components are authorized whenever they open a new AMQP link on an existing connection to the server. When a client tries to open a receiver link, the server checks if the client is authorized to
read
from the source address the client has specified in its AMQP
attach
frame. Analogously, when a client tries to open a sender link, the server checks if the client is authorized to
write
to the target address from the client’s
attach
frame.
Service implementations may additionally authorize individual (request) messages received from the client, e.g. based on the message’s
subject
for details about the different Hono APIs.
In the custom HTTP protocol adapter adapt the routes according to your needs.
Build and run the custom HTTP Protocol Adapter
If you have Hono running, you can launch your custom HTTP protocol adapter as a Docker Container or a Spring Boot application.
You may adopt the Maven profile
build-docker-image
from the Maven POM file of the standard HTTP Adapter into your custom adapter’s Maven POM file.
Follow the guidelines for running the HTTP Adapter in
HTTP Adapter
. Don’t forget to configure the custom protocol adapter to bind to a different port than the standard HTTP Adapter if you intend to run them both at the same time. See the
Port Configuration section
of the HTTP Adapter documentation for details.
Using the custom HTTP Protocol Adapter
Now that you have your custom HTTP protocol adapter up and running, you can use any HTTP client, like
curl
or
HTTPie
, to publish data to your custom adapter.
replyId
being an arbitrary identifier chosen by the application) (3). After receiving the command message, the protocol adapter determines the
command-handling protocol adapter instances
information for the device id of the command message (4). In this case here, the protocol adapter instance #1 is returned (5), meaning that the command is already at the right adapter instance. As the subscription for commands to device 4711 was done by gateway “gw-1”, the command gets forwarded to that gateway (6). It is then the responsibility of the gateway to forward the command to the device
4711
. After the gateway has acknowledged the command message, an “accepted” disposition will be sent back to the application (7).
Command response handling
When the device sends a command response via the gateway (1), the protocol adapter forwards the command message on the
link to the application (2).
Gateway subscribing for commands for all its devices
A gateway may also subscribe for commands sent to all the different devices that the gateway acts on behalf of. Such a scenario is shown in the following sequence diagram.
Command subscription
The gateway subscribes for commands just like a normal device would, only using its id
gw-1
(1). The protocol adapter creates the tenant-scoped consumer link on the
command/TENANT
address (if it doesn’t already exist) (2) and then updates the

Limiting the Overall Connection Time
Hono supports configuring limits based on the overall amount of time that the devices have already been connected to protocol adapters for a tenant. Please refer to the

If the limit has been already reached, then the connection request is rejected. The limit needs to be configured at the tenant level using the

Application Auth
Business Applications
connect to the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network in order to consume telemetry data and events and send commands to devices. It is therefore the responsibility of the AMQP Network to properly authenticate and authorize the application.
The Apache Qpid Dispatch Router which is used in Hono’s example deployment can be configured to authenticate consumers using arbitrary SASL mechanisms. Access to addresses for receiving messages can be restricted to certain identities. The Dispatch Router instance which is used in the example deployment is configured to delegate authentication of clients to the
Auth Server
by means of its
Auth Service Plugin
mechanism. This mechanism works in a very similar way as described above for the authentication of system components. The main difference is that the clients’ authorities are not transferred by means of a JSON Web Token but instead are carried in a property of the Auth Server’s AMQP

frame.

That means that either the application has to know about the gateway, or that it just assumes that the devices it sends commands to (and that are connected to the gateway) are always available for receiving commands. This may especially be the case for long-lasting command subscriptions (with the MQTT or AMQP adapter).

uses for verifying credentials and issuing tokens are defined in a configuration file (
services/auth/src/main/resources/permissions.json
) read in during start-up of the
Auth Server
. These authorities are used for authenticating and authorizing system components as well as
Business Applications
.
Please refer to the
Dispatch Router documentation
for details regarding configuration of
Dispatch Router
security.
Future Approach
In the long run Hono will still use tokens for authenticating clients but will use a policy based approach for authorizing requests, i.e. authorization decisions will be made by a central
policy enforcement
component. Hono services will pass in the client’s token, the resource being accessed and the intended action along with potentially other attributes to the policy enforcement component which will then make the authorization decision based on the configured rules (policy) and return the outcome to the component.
postShutdown

hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
command-handling protocol adapter instances
information for the device id of the command message (4).
In the example above, there is no adapter instance associated with the device
4711
. Therefore it is checked whether there are adapter instances handling commands for the gateways, configured to possibly act on behalf of the device. If there is an adapter instance associated with the last known gateway of the device, that instance is returned as the result. Otherwise, and in the example above, the command handling adapter instance for any of these gateways is returned (the choice being random if there are multiple instances). In the above example that is the instance #1 associated with gateway
gw-1
(5).
Then the command gets forwarded to that gateway (6). It is the responsibility of the gateway to forward the command to the device
4711
. After the gateway has acknowledged the command message, an “accepted” disposition will be sent back to the application (7).
Handling of the command response is done in the same way as shown in the chapter above for a gateway subscribing for a particular device and is therefore omitted here.
If a gateway has already subscribed for commands for all its device, it may still subscribe for commands for a particular device (and the other way around). The particular device subscription has precedence then in choosing over which subscription protocol/channel to send the command to the gateway.
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
is not
per se
a component being developed as part of Hono. Instead, Hono comes with a default implementation of the messaging network relying on artifacts provided by other open source projects. The default implementation currently consists of a single
Apache Qpid Dispatch Router
instance connected to a single
Apache Artemis
broker instance. Note that this setup is useful for development purposes but will probably not meet requirements regarding e.g. scalability of real world use cases.
The diagram below provides an overview of the default implementation of the Messaging Network component used with Hono.
Scaling out messaging infrastructure is a not a trivial task. Hono
does not
provide an out-of-the-box solution to this problem but instead integrates with the
EnMasse
project which aims at providing
Messaging as a Service
infrastructure.

remote service interfaces
for connecting
large numbers of IoT devices
to a back end and interacting with them in a
uniform
way regardless of the device communication protocol.
Hono specifically supports scalable and secure ingestion of large volumes of sensor data by means of its Telemetry and Event APIs. Hono's Command & Control API allows for sending commands (request messages) to devices and receive a reply to such a command from a device in an asynchronous way.
Finally, Hono provides APIs for integration with existing device and credentials management systems.
The Hono project provides implementations of the remote service interfaces mentioned above, leveraging existing messaging infrastructure components.
It is not the project's intention to create an additional message broker
implementation.

Failure to start
The component/service will fail to start if neither the secure not the insecure server have been configured properly.
Tracing
In normal operation the vast majority of messages should be flowing through the system without any noteworthy delays or problems. In fact, that is the whole purpose of Hono. However, that doesn’t mean that nothing can go wrong. For example, when a tenant’s device administrator changes the credentials of a device in the Credentials service but has not yet updated the credentials on the device yet, then the device will start to fail in uploading any data to the protocol adapter it connects to. After a while, a back end application’s administrator might notice, that there hasn’t been any data being received from that particular device for quite some time. The application administrator therefore calls up the Hono operations team and complains about the data
being lost somewhere
.
The operations team will have a hard time determining what is happening, because it will need to figure out which components have been involved in the processing of the device and why the data hasn’t been processed as usual. The metrics alone usually do not help much here because metrics are usually not scoped to individual devices. The logs written by the individual components, on the other hand, might contain enough information to correlate individual entries in the log with each other and thus
trace
the processing of the message throughout the system. However, this is usually a very tedious (and error prone) process and the relevant information is often only logged at a level (e.g.
DEBUG
) that is not used in production (often

and as such relies on the required resources to be available on the class path.
When starting up any of Hono’s Docker images as a container, the JVM will look for additional jar files to include in its class path in the container’s
/opt/hono/extensions
folder. Thus, using a specific implementation of OpenTracing is just a matter of configuring the container to mount a volume or binding a host folder at that location and putting the implementation’s jar files and resources into the corresponding volume or host folder.
Note
This also means that (currently) only Tracer implementations can be used with Hono that also implement the Tracer Resolver mechanism.
Assuming that the HTTP adapter should be configured to use
Jaeger tracing
, the following steps are necessary:
Download
Jaeger’s Java Tracer Resolver
implementation and its dependencies (see the hint at the end).
Put the jars to a folder on the Docker host, e.g.

Client Application
When the connection between an application client and Hono (i.e. the Dispatch Router) is supposed to be secured by TLS (which is a good idea), then the client application needs to be configured to trust the CA that signed the Dispatch Router’s certificate chain. Clients can use the
org.eclipse.hono.client.HonoConnection.newConnection(ClientConfigProperties)
method to establish a connection to Hono. The
org.eclipse.hono.config.ClientConfigProperties
instance passed in to the method needs to be configured with the trust store containing the CA’s certificate. Please refer to the
Hono Client configuration guide
for details regarding the corresponding configuration properties that need to be set.

Hi guys, I am trying to connect a custom TCP/IP protocol but get confused in the docs. Docs has example for custom adapter, but in the git repo examples has a custom Protocol Gateway. Which is the better way?

The Protocol Gateway approach is the
officially
supported and recommended one. If you are planning to deploy and operate Hono yourself, you can, of course, also implement a Protocol Adapter.

Trusted CA certificates to use for verifying signatures.
Using OpenSSL
Hono’s individual services are implemented in Java and therefore, by default, use the SSL/TLS engine that comes with the Java Virtual Machine that the services are running on. In case of the Docker images provided by Hono this is the SSL engine of OpenJDK. While the standard SSL engine has the advantage of being a part of the JVM itself and thus being available on every operating system that the JVM is running on without further installation, it provides only limited performance and throughput when compared to native TLS implementations like
OpenSSL
.
In order to address this problem, the Netty networking library that is used in Hono’s components can be configured to employ the OpenSSL instead of the JVM’s SSL engine by means of Netty’s
Forked Tomcat Native
(tcnative) module.
The tcnative module comes in several flavors, corresponding to the way that the OpenSSL library has been linked in. The statically linked versions include a specific version of OpenSSL (or
BoringSSL
for that matter) and is therefore most easy to use on supported platforms, regardless of whether another version of OpenSSL is already installed or not. In contrast, the dynamically linked variants depend on a particular version of OpenSSL being already installed on the operating system. Both approaches have their pros and cons and Hono therefore does not include tcnative in its Docker images by default, i.e. Hono’s services will use the JVM’s default SSL engine by default.

The Protocol Gateway approach is the
officially
supported and recommended one. If you are planning to deploy and operate Hono yourself, you can, of course, also implement a Protocol Adapter.
Thanks, I will look into it more.

Hint
: to resolve all dependencies for
jaeger-tracerresolver
in order to provide them to
/opt/hono/extensions
, you may want to rely on Maven’s dependency plugin. To obtain all jar files you can invoke the following command in a simple Maven project that contains only the dependency to
jaeger-tracerresolver
:
All jar files can then be found in the directory
target/dependency
.
Configuring usage of Jaeger tracing (included in Docker images)
In case
Jaeger tracing
shall be used, there is an alternative to putting the jar files in the container’s
/opt/hono/extensions
folder as described above. This is to have the Jaeger tracing jar files be included in the Hono Docker images by using the
When starting up any of Hono’s Docker images as a container, the JVM will look for additional jar files to include in its classpath in the container’s
/opt/hono/extensions
folder. Thus, using a specific variant of tcnative is just a matter of configuring the container to mount a volume or binding a host folder at that location and putting the desired variant of tcnative into the corresponding volume or host folder.r Assuming that the Auth Server should be run with the statically linked, BoringSSL based tcnative variant, the following steps are necessary:
Download tcnative
matching the platform architecture (
linux-x86_64
).
Put the jar file to a folder on the Docker host, e.g.
/tmp/tcnative
.
Start the Auth Server Docker image mounting the host folder:
Note that the command given above does not contain the environment variables and secrets that are usually required to configure the service properly.
When the Auth Server starts up, it will look for a working variant of tcnative on its classpath and (if found) use it for establishing TLS connections. The service’s log file will indicate whether the JVM’s default SSL engine or OpenSSL is used.

provides uniform (remote) service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a (cloud) back end. It specifically supports scalable and secure data ingestion (
telemetry
data) as well as
command & control
type message exchange patterns and provides interfaces for provisioning & managing device identity and access control rules.
Getting started
Please refer to the
Getting Started guide on the project web site
.
Running Hono
Eclipse Hono consists of multiple micro service components. Please refer to the
Admin Guide

Enforcing the recording of traces for a tenant
Typically, in production systems, the tracing components will be configured to not store
all
trace spans in the tracing backend, in order to reduce the performance impact. For debugging purposes it can however be beneficial to enforce the recording of certain traces. Hono allows this by providing a configuration option in the Tenant information with which all traces concerning the processing of telemetry, event and command messages for that specific tenant will be recorded. Furthermore, this enforced trace sampling can be restricted to only apply to messages sent in the context of a specific authentication identifier. Please refer to the
description of the
tracing
object
in the Tenant Information for details.
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
works the same way but requires the use of
volume
as the
type
of the
--mount
parameter. Please refer to the
Docker reference documentation
for details.
Server Name Indication (SNI)
Server Name Indication
can be used to indicate to a server the host name that the client wants to connect to as part of the TLS handshake. This is useful in order to be able to host multiple
virtual
servers on a single network address. In particular, SNI allows server components to select a server certificate that matches the domain name indicated by the client using SNI.
Hono’s protocol adapters support
virtual
servers by means of SNI as described above. Devices can then connect to a protocol adapter using any one of the configured

The following steps a re necessary in order to configure the protocol adapters with multiple

Create Server Certificate(s)
When a device establishes a connection to one of Hono’s protocol adapters using one of its
virtual
domain names, then it includes the domain name in its TLS

message by means of the SNI extension. The server can then use this information to determine the matching server certificate and corresponding private key that is required to perform the TLS handshake.
It is therefore necessary to create a private key and certificate for each

server’s domain name needs to be added to the certificate’s

Hono’s protocol adapters then need to be configured with the server certificates and keys. In order to do so, the certificates and corresponding private keys need to be added to a
key store
. Hono supports the
JKS
and
PKCS12
key store formats for that purpose. Once the key store has been created, Hono’s protocol adapters need to be configured with the path to the key store by means of the adapters’
KEY_STORE_PATH
configuration variable. Please refer to the
protocol adapter admin guides
for details on how to configure the key store path.

Hono’s protocol adapters can be configured to support SNI by means of the

The method are intended to start/stop the underlying connection to the broker. However, I wonder if it would be better to only let implementations (optionally) implement Lifecycle instead of making it mandatory for TelemetrySender and EventSender ...

outcome
The number of attempts made by devices to connect to a protocol adapter. The
outcome
tag’s value determines if the attempt was successful or not. In the latter case the outcome also indicates the reason for the failure to connect.

Authentication API Specification
The
Authentication API
is used to retrieve a
token
asserting a subject’s identity and granted authorities. Other service implementations use such a token to make authorization decisions on a client’s request to read or write from/to a resource or to invoke a certain operation.
The Authentication API is defined by means of AMQP 1.0 message exchanges, i.e. a client needs to connect to an Authentication service using an AMQP 1.0 client in order to invoke operations of the API as described in the following sections.

In a real world environment there will often already be an
identity management system
in place. In such cases it can make sense to just implement a
facade
Get Token
Clients use this operation to
verify a set of credentials and
retrieve a token asserting the authenticated subject’s identity and granted authorities.
Message Flow
The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of messages involved in a
Client
retrieving a token.

to retrieve credentials used to authenticate
Devices
connecting to the adapter. In particular, the API supports to look up
shared secrets
which are often used by IoT devices by means of
username/password
based authentication schemes.
Credentials are of a certain
type
which indicates which authentication mechanism the credentials can be used with. Each set of credentials also contains an
authentication identity
which is the identity claimed by the device during authentication. This authentication identity is usually different from the
device-id
the device has been registered under. A device may have multiple sets of credentials, using arbitrary
authentication identities
.
The Credentials API is defined by means of AMQP 1.0 message exchanges, i.e. a client needs to connect to Hono using an AMQP 1.0 client in order to invoke operations of the API as described in the following sections.
Preconditions for invoking the Credentials API
receiver
on the connection using source address
where
reply-to
may be any arbitrary string chosen by the client. This link is used by the client to receive responses to the requests it has sent to the Device Registration service. This link’s source address is also referred to as the
reply-to
address for the request messages.
Client connecting to Device Registration service
Assert Device Registration
Clients use this command to verify that a device is registered for a particular tenant and is enabled.
Message Flow
The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of messages involved in a
Client
asserting a device’s registration status.
Client asserting a device's registration status
Request Message Format
The following table provides an overview of the properties a client needs to set on a message to assert a device’s registration status:
Name
Client has established an AMQP link in role
receiver
on the connection using source address
where
reply-to
may be any arbitrary string chosen by the client. This link is used by the client to receive responses to the requests it has sent to the Device Connection service. This link’s source address is also referred to as the
reply-to
address for the request messages.
Client connecting to Device Connection service
Set last known Gateway for Device
Clients use this command to

As this operation is invoked frequently by Hono’s components, implementors may choose to keep this information in memory. This API doesn’t mandate checks on the validity of the given device or gateway IDs in order not to introduce a dependency on the

the Tenant API’s operations and the payload data format used by them. Please refer to
Multi Tenancy
for details regarding the way Hono supports multiple tenants.
The Tenant API is defined by means of AMQP 1.0 message exchanges, i.e. a client needs to connect to Hono using an AMQP 1.0 client in order to invoke operations of the API as described in the following sections.

The
ServiceClient
interface currently extends
Closable
which serves a similar purpose as
Lifecycle.stop()
, so I wonder if we should drop the
Closeable
reference altogether and instead let client implementations (optionally) implement
Lifecycle
. WDYT?
Do you want to cast the clients to invoke the lifecycle methods?

method is quite universal, it is to be expected that clients allocate resources and need to release them again (client implementations are free to decide what this means in their context). My concern was more that the lifecycle implies that a closed instance can be
re-opened
later on (at least the documentation says nothing to the contrary). This puts higher requirements on the client implementation which might not be necessary. So, IMHO the interfaces should either extend
Closable
or
Lifecycle
.
We can then also think about making implementing
ServiceClient
optional as well. Or does it always make sense for
TelemetrySender
and
EventSender
implementations to register health checks?
This is a tough question. Yesterday I designed a health check mechanism for the Kafka client, which might add value. But maybe we should write down clear expectations, in which kind of events the health checks are expected to fail and what will be the consequences.
I assume that you intend to aggregate them in the readiness and liveness checks of the protocol adapters so that a failing liveness check would trigger a pod restart...
Copy link
type
,
status
The number of bytes conveyed in the payload of a telemetry or event message.
Minimum Message Size
If a minimum message size is configured for a
tenant
, then the payload size of the telemetry, event and command messages are calculated in accordance with the configured value and then reported to the metrics by the AMQP, HTTP and MQTT protocol adapters. If minimum message size is not configured for a tenant then the actual message payload size is reported.
Assume that the minimum message size for a tenant is configured as 4096 bytes (4KB). The payload size of an incoming message with size 1KB is calculated as 4KB by the protocol adapters and reported to the metrics system. For an incoming message of size 10KB, it is reported as 12KB.
Service Metrics
Hono’s service components do not report any metrics at the moment.

My concern was more that the lifecycle implies that a closed instance can be re-opened later on (at least the documentation says nothing to the contrary). This puts higher requirements on the client implementation which might not be necessary. So, IMHO the interfaces should either extend Closable or Lifecycle.
We can refine the JavaDoc of the
Lifecyle.stop()
method to make it clear that there is no expectation that the component can be restarted after its
stop()
method has been invoked. But I would rather not support components implementing
Lifecycle
or
Closable
but instead only support
Lifecycle

I assume that you intend to aggregate them in the readiness and liveness checks of the protocol adapters so that a failing liveness check would trigger a pod restart...
Yes, that is the idea. However, it is not so much about the liveness check but more about the readiness check ...

registered for a device to augment messages published by the device with missing information like a content type. In particular, the protocol adapter adds default values registered for the device as (application) properties with the same name to the AMQP 1.0 messages it sends downstream to the AMQP Messaging Network.

--hono.amqp.idleTimeout
no
60000
The time interval (milliseconds) to wait for incoming traffic from a device before the connection should be considered stale and thus be closed. Setting this property to

However, it is not so much about the liveness check but more about the readiness check ...
The readiness check serves a similar purpose as
Lifecyle.start()
. The protocol adapter can use it for its readyness check.
So, if we keep
Lifecycle
, we IMHO could remove the health check methods and the
Closable
interface. WDYT?

The token may contain any number of additional claims which may be ignored by clients that do not understand their meaning.
Resource Authorities
A client’s authority on a resource is represented by a JWT
claim
with a name containing the resource node address prefixed with
r:
and a value containing the activities the client is allowed to perform on the resource. The node address MAY contain one or more wildcard (

The
client-certificate
property MAY be used by the service implementation for auto-provisioning of devices. To do so, the device registry needs to create credentials (and registration data) for the device if they do not already exist.
Additionally, the body MAY contain arbitrary properties that service implementations can use to determine a device’s identity.
The following request payload may be used to look up the hashed password for a device with the authentication identifier

The readiness check serves a similar purpose as Lifecyle.start().
No, the readiness check is being performed periodically (triggered by an external monitor) whereas the
start
method is being invoked once during startup of the component. In our case the readiness check verifies, if for example the connection to the service is still open and working. The start method is invoked once only to initially establish the connection ...

I have pushed some changes which work for the AMQP based implementation.
@b-abel
can you check, if this works for the Kafka based implementation as well?
@sophokles73
: You removed
Closeable
as well as
Lifecycle
. The Kafka client needs to be closed at some point. I think this would apply to nearly every client. When implementing a client I would like to see this expectation explicitly in the interface and be sure which method to implement to release resources. When implementing a protocol adapter I would like not to do type casts to find out how the client is to be closed.

Hi guys, I am trying to connect a custom TCP/IP protocol but get confused in the docs. Docs has example for custom adapter, but in the git repo examples has a custom Protocol Gateway. Which is the better way?

The Protocol Gateway approach is the
officially
supported and recommended one. If you are planning to deploy and operate Hono yourself, you can, of course, also implement a Protocol Adapter.

Below is an example for a payload of a response to an

which also includes a default
content-type
and a mapper service:
The response message’s
status
property may contain the following codes:
Code
Description
200
OK, the device is registered for the given tenant and is enabled. The response message body contains the asserted device’s registration status.
400
Bad Request, the request message did not contain all mandatory properties.
403
the protocol adapter instance that currently handles command & control messages for a given device.
Clients can provide an optional
lifespan
parameter to make the protocol adapter instance entry expire after the given number of seconds. Note that implementations of this API have to support this feature, otherwise protocol adapters, as the clients of this API, might fail to correctly route command messages.
This API doesn’t mandate checks on the validity of the given device in order not to introduce a dependency on the
Device Registration API
. However, implementations of this API may choose to perform such checks or impose a restriction on the overall amount of data that can be stored per tenant in order to protect against malicious requests.
Message Flow

Not Found, there is no tenant matching the given search criteria.
For status codes indicating an error (codes in the
400 - 499
range) the message body MAY contain a detailed description of the error that occurred. In this case, the response message’s

Sending Data from Hono to Ditto ( amqp:resource-limit-exceeded)
Hono and Ditto are successfully connected. But when I try to send the data from Hono, I will be getting 503 - Service not available message. But then when I checked the Ditto logs. I got the below ...

@Rassilion
The Protocol Gateway approach is the
officially
supported and recommended one. If you are planning to deploy and operate Hono yourself, you can, of course, also implement a Protocol Adapter.
Thanks, I will look into it more.

window.webpackPublicPath = '//cdn02.gitter.im/_s/edbef577a/js/';
string
Contains an
RFC 2616
compliant
cache directive
. The directive contained in the property MUST be obeyed by clients that are caching responses.
The response message payload MUST contain credential information as defined in
Credentials Format
if the
status
is
200
or
201
.
The response message’s
status
Forbidden, the gateway with the given
gateway id
either does not exist, is not enabled or is not authorized to get an assertion for the device with the given
device id
.
404
Not Found, there is no device registered with the given
device id
within the given
tenant id
or the device is not enabled.
For status codes indicating an error (codes in the
400 - 499
range) the message body MAY contain a detailed description of the error that occurred. In this case, the response message’s
content-type
property SHOULD be set accordingly.
Delivery States
The Device Registration service uses the following AMQP message delivery states when receiving request messages from clients:
subject
yes
properties
string
MUST be set to
set-cmd-handling-adapter-instance
.
adapter_instance_id
yes
application-properties

The identifier of the protocol adapter instance that currently handles commands for the device or gateway identified by the
device_id
property.

no
application-properties
Tenant information is carried in a single
Data
section of the response message as a UTF-8 encoded string representation of a single JSON object. It is an error to include payload that is not of this type.
The table below provides an overview of the standard members defined for the JSON response object:

A list of configuration options valid for certain adapters only. The format of a configuration option is described here

Metrics Configuration
Auth Server Configuration
The Auth Server component exposes a service endpoint implementing Eclipse Hono™’s
Authentication
API. Other services use this component for authenticating clients and retrieving a token asserting the client’s identity and corresponding authorities.
This component serves as a default implementation of the
Authentication
API only. On startup, it reads in all identities and their authorities from a JSON file from the file system. All data is then kept in memory and there are no remote service APIs for managing the identities and their authorities.
The Auth Server is implemented as a Spring Boot application. It can be run either directly from the command line or by means of starting the corresponding
Docker image
created from it.
Service Configuration
In addition to the following options, this component supports the options described in
Common Configuration
.
The server can be configured by means of environment variables or corresponding command line options. The following table provides an overview of the configuration variables and corresponding command line options that the server supports:
Protocol Adapter Options
AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network Connection Configuration
Command & Control Connection Configuration
Tenant Service Connection Configuration
Device Registration Service Connection Configuration
Credentials Service Connection Configuration
Device Connection Service Connection Configuration
Direct Connection to Data Grid
Resource Limits Checker Configuration
Connection Event Producer Configuration
Common Configuration
Many Hono components support a common set of configuration options. This section describes those options.
Each component which supports the following options explicitly states so. If it doesn’t, then these options are not supported by this component.
Java VM Options
The Java VM started in Hono’s components can be configured with arbitrary command line options by means of setting the
JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS
environment variable.

property may contain the following codes:
Code
Description
200
OK, the payload contains the credentials for the authentication identifier.
201
Created, the payload contains the newly created credentials for the authentication identifier.
400
Bad Request, the request message did not contain all mandatory properties or the subject DN of the certificate does not match the authentication identifier.
404
Not Found, there are no credentials registered matching the criteria.
For status codes indicating an error (codes in the
400 - 499
range) the message body MAY contain a detailed description of the error that occurred. In this case, the response message’s
content-type
property SHOULD be set accordingly.
Delivery States
The Credentials service uses the following AMQP message delivery states when receiving request messages from clients:
Delivery State
Description
ACCEPTED
Indicates that the request message has been received and accepted for processing.
REJECTED
Indicates that the request message has been received but cannot be processed. The disposition frame’s
error
field contains information regarding the reason why. Clients should not try to re-send the request using the same message properties in this case.
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
int
The lifespan of the mapping entry in seconds. After that period, the mapping entry shall be treated as non-existent by the
Device Registration API
methods. A negative value, as well as an omitted property, is interpreted as an unlimited lifespan.
The body of the message SHOULD be empty and will be ignored if it is not.
Response Message Format
A response to a
set command-handling adapter instance for device
request contains the
Standard Response Properties
.
The response message’s
status
property may contain the following codes:
Code
Description
204
NB
Only a single entry per
type
is allowed. If multiple entries for the same
type
are present it is handled as an error.
NB
If the element is omitted then all adapters are
enabled

org.eclipse.hono.util.Lifecycle
mandatory, right?
Yes, I was never against it. I am sorry if my comments were not clear enough. I thought we agreed that having
Lifecycle
and
Closeable
mandatory was too much. And I understood that you favor
Lifecycle
over
Closeable
.
So, now hopefully more clear:
I am for a mandatory close method
. I care less about its name (
Lifecyle.stop()
is fine as well) or its signature.

Delivery State
Description
ACCEPTED
Indicates that the request message has been received and accepted for processing.
REJECTED
Indicates that the request message has been received but cannot be processed. The disposition frame’s
error
field contains information regarding the reason why. Clients should not try to re-send the request using the same message properties in this case.
Credentials Format
Credential data is carried in the body of an AMQP message as part of a single
Data
section. The message’s
content-type
property must be set to
application/json
.
The credential data is contained in the Data section as a UTF-8 encoded string representation of a single JSON object. It is an error to include payload that is not of this type.
OK, the command-handling adapter instance for the device has been updated.
400
Bad Request, the adapter instance for the device has not been set or updated due to invalid or missing data in the request.
Implementors of this API may return a
404
status code in order to indicate that no device with the given identifier exists for the given tenant. However, performing such a check is optional.
For status codes indicating an error (codes in the
400 - 499
range) the message body MAY contain a detailed description of the error that occurred.
Remove command-handling protocol adapter instance for device
Clients use this command to
remove
the information, which protocol adapter instance is currently handling command & control messages for the given device. The mapping information is only removed, if the currently associated adapter instance matches the one given in the request.
This API doesn’t mandate checks on the validity of the given device in order not to introduce a dependency on the
Device Registration API
. However, implementations of this API may choose to perform such checks or impose a restriction on the overall amount of data that can be stored per tenant in order to protect against malicious requests.
Message Flow
Client removes the command-handling protocol adapter instance information for device
boolean
If set to
false
the tenant is currently disabled. Protocol adapters MUST NOT allow devices of a disabled tenant to connect and MUST NOT accept data published by such devices.
minimum-message-size
no
number
The minimum message size in bytes. If it is set then the payload size of the telemetry, event and command messages are calculated in accordance with the configured value and then reported to the metrics. See
Metrics
for more details.
resource-limits
no
object
Any resource limits that should be enforced for the tenant, e.g. the maximum number of concurrent connections and the maximum data volume for a given period. Refer to
Resource Limits Configuration Format
for details.

Sigfox Adapter
The Sigfox protocol adapter exposes an HTTP endpoint for connecting up with the Sigfox backend for publishing telemetry, events and use command & control.
Tech preview
This protocol adapter is not considered production ready. Its APIs might still be subject to change without warning.
Pre-requisites
This Sigfox adapter only connects to the Sigfox backend system (
backend.sigfox.com
). It does not allow direct access to Sigfox devices.
So you need to set up your Sigfox devices on
backend.sigfox.com
and then configure the callbacks connect to your installation of Hono.

Eclipse Hono – Connecting large numbers of IoT devices
9 min
The value of an IoT solution often correlates directly to its ability to connect many different devices and integrate them into higher-level solutions. Although all solutions combine devices using a unique integration strategy, the
reliable, secure, and scalable connection of devices is always crucial
.
Connectivity is therefore best handled as a separate service, independent of a solution – and this is exactly what Eclipse Hono aims to accomplish.
Overview
Eclipse Hono is written entirely in Java. It also provides a uniform messaging infrastructure for IoT solutions. Eclipse Hono offers:

Kura Adapter
The Kura protocol adapter exposes an MQTT topic hierarchy allowing Eclipse Kura™ based gateways to publish
control
and
data
messages to Eclipse Hono™’s Telemetry and Event endpoints.
Note
The Kura adapter is supposed to be used with gateways running Kura version 3.x. Gateways running Kura version 4 and later should connect to the MQTT adapter instead.
Authentication
The Kura adapter by default requires devices (gateways) to authenticate during connection establishment. The adapter supports both the authentication based on the username/password provided in an MQTT CONNECT packet as well as client certificate based authentication as part of a TLS handshake for that purpose.
The adapter tries to authenticate the device using these mechanisms in the following order

HONO_AUTH_AMQP_KEY_PATH
.
Alternatively, the
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_KEY_STORE_PATH
option can be used to configure a key store containing both the key as well as the certificate.
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT
--hono.auth.amqp.insecurePort
no
-
The insecure port the server should listen on.
See
Port Configuration
HONO_VERTX_DNS_QUERY_TIMEOUT
--hono.vertx.dnsQueryTimeout
no
5000
The amount of time (in milliseconds) after which a DNS query is considered to be failed. Setting this variable to a smaller value may help to reduce the time required to establish connections to the services this adapter depends on. However, setting it to a value that is too small for any DNS query to succeed will effectively prevent any connections to be established at all.
HONO_VERTX_MAX_EVENT_LOOP_EXECUTE_TIME_MILLIS
--hono.vertx.maxEventLoopExecuteTimeMillis
no
2000
The maximum number of milliseconds that a task on the event loop may run without being considered to block the event loop.

In a nutshell, the Sigfox adapter requires a single
device
identity, acting as a gateway device. This identity will be used to connect to Hono. All devices registered with Sigfox (the actual Sigfox devices), will be registered in Hono to allow this first identity as their gateway device.
Setup example
The following sub-sections walk you through an example setup.
Registering devices
This example assumes that the Sigfox protocol adapter is available as
https://iot-sigfox-adapter.my.hono
.
Create a new
gateway device
with the following registration:
Create new credentials for the
gateway device
. For example, using a username of
sigfox
and a password of

IoT communication patterns and QoS
Most messages in IoT setups are usually
telemetry
messages: data flows from devices to solutions. Messages of this kind usually need not be guaranteed of reaching their destinations and can be handled especially efficiently because there are no acknowledgements involved (QoS “at most once”). A typical type of telemetry data is sensor data that is sent within short time frames.

Will there be the community call today or do we skip it in favor of the EclipseCon?
When a device uses a client certificate for authentication during the TLS handshake, the adapter tries to determine the tenant that the device belongs to based on the
issuer DN
contained in the certificate. In order for the lookup to succeed, the tenant’s trust anchor needs to be configured by means of registering the
trusted certificate authority
. The device’s client certificate will then be validated using the registered trust anchor, thus implicitly establishing the tenant that the device belongs to. In a second step, the adapter uses the Credentials API’s
get
operation to retrieve the credentials on record, including the client certificate’s
subject DN
as the
auth-id
,
x509-cert
as the
type
of secret and the MQTT client identifier as
client-id
in the request payload.

Device Authentication
The CoAP adapter by default requires clients (devices or gateway components) to authenticate during connection establishment. The adapter (currently) only supports
PSK
as part of a DTLS handshake for that purpose. Additional variants mentioned in
Securing CoAP
might be added in the future.
The adapter tries to authenticate the device using these mechanisms in the following order
PSK
The
identity
provided in the ClientKeyExchange must have the form
auth-id@tenant
, e.g.
sensor1@DEFAULT_TENANT
. The adapter performs the handshake using the credentials the
configured Credentials service
has on record for the client. The adapter uses the Credentials API’s

Telemetry messages that absolutely must be delivered (QoS “at least once”) are called
events
, which are always acknowledged to the client and occur infrequently by comparison. Typical events include alarms that need a guarantee to reach the solution and must never be dropped.
The other direction is called
command and control:
data flows from solutions to devices. This addresses the control of actors, or in general messages initiated by the solution, and will be provided in future versions of Eclipse Hono (versions > 0.5).

The adapter needs to be
configured for TLS

Username/Password
When a device wants to authenticate using this mechanism, it needs to provide a
username
and a
password
in the MQTT
CONNECT
packet it sends in order to initiate the connection. The
username
must have the form

Device Registration API

Credentials API
.
As such it exposes AMQP 1.0 based endpoints for retrieving the relevant information and persists data in the local filesystem.
In addition, the Device Registry also exposes HTTP resources for managing the contents of the registry according to the
Device Registry HTTP API
.
Warning
The Device Registry is not intended to be used in production environments. In particular, access to the HTTP resources described below is not restricted to authorized clients only.
The resources have been designed to provide convenient access to the registry’s content using command line tools like
curl
or
HTTPie
.
Device Registration API
and
Credentials API
. As such it exposes AMQP 1.0 based endpoints for retrieving the relevant information. Protocol adapters use these APIs to determine a device’s registration status, e.g. if it is enabled and if it is registered with a particular tenant, and to authenticate a device before accepting any data for processing from it.
In addition to the above APIs, this Device Registry also exposes HTTP endpoints for managing the contents of the Device Registry according to the
Device Registry Management API
. It uses a MongoDB database to persist the data. The credentials, device and tenant information are stored in separate collections in a MongoDB database. For more information on how to configure the MongoDB based device registry, see
MongoDB based Device Registry configuration
.
Authentication
This Device Registry secures its HTTP Endpoints using basic authentication mechanism. Thereby the clients connecting to the MongoDB based Device Registry are required to authenticate. For more information on how to enable the authentication and configure it, please refer to the
hono.registry.http.authenticationRequired
property in the
MongoDB based Device Registry configuration
.
Managing Tenants
Please refer to the
operation to retrieve the credentials on record with the
tenant
and
auth-id
provided by the device in the

the credentials are not supposed to be used to authenticate devices any longer. This may e.g. be used to disable a particular mechanism for authenticating the device.
NB
It is the responsibility of the protocol adapter to make use of this information.
secrets
yes
array
A list of secrets scoped to a particular time period. See
Secrets Format
for details.
NB
This array must contain at least one element - an empty array is considered an error.
For each set of credentials the combination of

400
Bad Request, the request message does not contain all required properties.

Precondition failed, the adapter instance for the device has not been removed because there is no matching command-handling adapter instance assigned to the device.
Implementors of this API may return a

For status codes indicating an error (codes in the

handling of device identities and device credentials for secure communication
authentication of devices and microservices
Because the handling of device identities is assumed to be specific to a production setup, it is provided by a simple file-based implementation. Due to the use of Spring beans and the Vert.x event bus, this implementation can easily be substituted by a database implementation.
The same applies for the (file-based) authentication server, which may be replaced with other implementations.

There are several different categories of Hono components:

Protocol adapters connect devices to Hono. Each covers a specific protocol and is responsible for the authentication of devices by querying the device registry.

AMQP Adapter
The AMQP protocol adapter allows clients (devices or gateway components) supporting the AMQP 1.0 protocol to publish messages to Eclipse Hono™’s Telemetry, Event and Command & Control endpoints.
Device Authentication
By default, all Hono protocol adapters require clients (devices or gateway components) to authenticate during connection establishment. This is the preferred way for devices to publish data via protocol adapters. The AMQP adapter supports both the
SASL PLAIN
and
SASL EXTERNAL
authentication mechanisms. The former uses a
username
and
password
to authenticate to the adapter while the latter uses an X.509 client certificate.
This guide provides examples for publishing telemetry and events for

The protocol adapter issues a warning on the console if
HONO_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT
is set to the default secure port (5671) used by the adapter for secure connections.
The

This variable might be used to e.g. expose the non-TLS secured port on a local interface only, thus providing easy access from within the local network, while still requiring encrypted communication when accessed from the outside over public network infrastructure.

To get all the registered Devices in Eclipse Hono Tenant
Is there a way to get list of all the Tenants names/id in a Hono server. Is there a way to get list of all Devices registered in a particular tenant.
eclipse-hono
eclipse-iot
property. If set to
false
, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.
NB
Care needs to be taken that the value for the
authentication identifier
is compliant with the authentication mechanism(s) it is supposed to be used with. For example, when using standard HTTP Basic authentication, the
username
part of the Basic Authorization header value (which corresponds to the
auth-id
) MUST not contain any
colon
(
:
) characters, because the colon character is used as the separator between username and password. Similar constraints may exist for other authentication mechanisms, so the
authentication identifier
needs to be chosen with the anticipated mechanism(s) being used in mind. Otherwise, devices may fail to authenticate with protocol adapters, even if the credentials provided by the device match the credentials registered for the device. In general, using only characters from the
[a-zA-Z0-9_-]
As part of the request message, the client is supposed to provide the list of gateways that may act on behalf of the given device. The client may get this list via the Device Registration API’s
assert Device Registration
operation.
This API doesn’t mandate checks on the validity of the given device and the gateway list in order not to introduce a dependency on the
Device Registration API
.
The command implementation MUST determine the adapter instances by applying the following rules (in the given order):
If an adapter instance is associated with the given device, this adapter instance is returned as the
single
returned list entry.
Otherwise, if there is an adapter instance registered for the last known gateway associated with the given device, this adapter instance is returned as the
single
returned list entry. The last known gateway has to be contained in the given list of gateways for this case.
Otherwise,
all
adapter instances associated with any of the given gateway identifiers are returned.
That means that for a device communicating via a gateway, the result is reduced to a
no
object
Defines in how far OpenTracing spans created when processing messages for this tenant and a particular auth-id shall be recorded (sampled) by the tracing system. The child properties have the auth-id as name. A child property value of
default
lets the default sampling mechanism be used. The child property value
all
marks the spans related to this tenant and the auth-id so that they should all be sampled. The child property value
none
marks the spans as not to be sampled. The mode defined for a particular auth-id has precedence over the value defined by the
sampling-mode
property.

At the moment you need to manually put in the

AMQP 1.0 Network
The AMQP 1.0 Network decouples Hono’s core microservices from solution applications. It provides a scalable messaging infrastructure that supports different communication patterns with varying quality of service levels.
A few properties of the AMQP 1.0 messaging protocol make it an ideal candidate for this purpose.
First, this is one of very few messaging protocols that is truly
symmetrical

supported and recommended one. If you are planning to deploy and operate Hono yourself, you can, of course, also implement a Protocol Adapter.

Please refer to the
Eclipse Kura documentation
on how to configure the gateway’s cloud service connection accordingly. It is important to set the gateway’s
topic.context.account-name
to the ID of the Hono tenant that the gateway has been registered with whereas the gateway’s
client-id
needs to be set to the corresponding Hono device ID. The
auth-id
used as part of the gateway’s
username
property needs to match the authentication identifier of a set of credentials registered for the device ID in Hono’s Credentials service. In other words, the credentials configured on the gateway need to belong to the corresponding device ID.

operation’s request payload as a Base64 encoded byte array instead of a plain string. This has been fixed.
The file based as well as the Mongo DB based registry implementations had failed to do both updating an existing secret (referred to by ID) and adding a new secret to the same credentials in a single request. This has been fixed.
The property names for specifying the patterns for validating Tenant and Device IDs have been fixed in the admin guides for the file based and the Mongo DB based registry implementations.
The registry implementations did not accept X.509 credentials in an update Credentials request. They also failed to remove existing credentials of a device if they were not included in an update Credentials request. This has been fixed.
The file based device registry also now supports searching devices for a tenant with optional filters, paging and sorting options. Please refer to the
Device registry management API
for details.
The wildcards
?
and
*
are now supported by the search devices operation in the MongoDB based device registry. Please refer to the
Device registry management API
for details.
Command messages that have their payload in an AMQP body section whose type isn’t supported in Hono now get rejected, instead of getting forwarded to the device with an empty payload.
The authentication providers in Hono use
CredentialsObject.getCandidateSecrets
to retrieve valid secrets. The secrets are currently filtered based on their validity period regardless of whether the status is enabled or not. This has been fixed now, so that the disabled secrets are filtered out.

The
Command & Control
API of Eclipse Hono™ is used by
Business Applications
to send commands to connected devices.
Commands can be used to trigger actions on devices. Examples include updating a configuration property, installing a software component or switching the state of an actuator.
Hono distinguishes two types of commands. The first type is
one-way
only. In this case the sender of the command does not expect the device to send back a message in response to the command. This type of command is referred to as a
one-way command
in the remainder of this page. One-way commands may be used to e.g.
notify
a device about a change of state.
The second type of commands expects a
response
to be sent back from the device as a result of processing the command. In this case the response contains a
status
code which indicates whether the command could be processed successfully. If so, the response may also include data representing the result of processing the command. This type of command is plainly referred to as a

Message Limits
The adapter rejects
a client’s request to upload data with status code

and
any AMQP 1.0 message containing a command sent by a north bound application
if the
message limit
that has been configured for the device’s tenant is exceeded.
CoAP Content Format Codes
CoAP doesn’t use a textual identifier for content types. Instead numbers are used, which are maintained by the
IANA
. The
IANA - CoAP Content Formats
page lists all (currently) registered codes and the corresponding media types.

Dual Port
The protocol adapter may be configured to open both a secure and a non-secure port at the same time simply by configuring both ports as described above. For this to work, both ports must be configured to use different port numbers, otherwise startup will fail.
Ephemeral Ports
Both the secure as well as the insecure port numbers may be explicitly set to

. It does not require a broker as an intermediary in the message exchange process. It supports both “
store and forward
” (brokered) and
direct
messaging communication patterns. The symmetrical nature of AMQP 1.0 allows Hono to use different communication semantics and different messaging components to handle various flows of messages.
The entry gateway into Hono’s AMQP messaging system is the
Apache QPid Dispatch Router
. It provides direct communication between producing and consuming endpoints. Unlike a broker, the router never takes ownership of messages; it instead simply passes AMQP packets between different endpoints. This means that, from a messaging perspective, the router is basically
stateless
. As such, it is much more vertically scalable than a message broker. In addition, it is far easier to scale it horizontally in a cloud environment – as we will see in a moment.
Another important feature of AMQP 1.0 is its
flow control
mechanism, which is implemented directly in the protocol. This means that consumers will, at every point, declare their capacity, or how many messages should be delivered to them. This information is propagated by the router, and producers of messages can be throttled to the speed of consumption.
It is now easy to see why Hono uses only routers to deliver telemetry messages to the solution tier. These messages typically exhibit a large volume, which requires scaling – but at the same time, we can afford to lose them if something goes wrong.
In the example deployment, Hono comes with a single router for simplicity. In real-world deployments, routers are usually deployed in networks. Often,

API Changes
The deprecated configuration property
singleTenant
of the protocol adapters and the device registry has been removed.
The default pattern for valid device identifiers used for the file based and the MongoDB based registry implementations now also contains a colon for compatibility with Eclipse Ditto.
1.4.0
New Features
The protocol adapters now report connection attempts made by devices in a new metric. In particular, the metric includes a tag reflecting the outcome of the attempt to establish a connection and the reason for failure. Please refer to the
Metrics API
for details.
A new Quarkus based HTTP protocol adapter is now available. This adapter version provides better memory consumption and startup times comparing to the existing one.
The LoraWAN protocol adapter has been extended with support for the
Actility Enterprise
provider.

when connecting to the AMQP adapter. If the adapter is configured for multi-tenancy (i.e
HONO_AMQP_SINGLE_TENANT
is set to
false
), then the
username
must match the pattern [
auth-id@tenant
], e.g.
sensor1@DEFAULT_TENANT
. Otherwise, the tenant-id can be omitted from the username and the client is assumed to belong to the
DEFAULT_TENANT
.
The adapter verifies the credentials provided by the client against the credentials that the
configured Credentials service
has on record for the client. If the credentials match, the client device can proceed to publish messages to Hono.

Configuring the Device Connection Service
The Device Connection service provides an implementation of Eclipse Hono™’s
Device Connection API
.
Protocol adapters use this API to store and retrieve information about the gateway that a device is using to connect to Hono’s protocol adapters. This information is necessary for routing commands to the particular protocol adapter instance that the gateway used by the device is connected to.
The Device Connection component provides a production grade implementation of the Device Connection API which uses a remote
data grid
for storing information about device connections. The data grid can be scaled out independently from the Device Connection service components to meet the storage demands at hand.
The Device Connection component is implemented as a Spring Boot application. It can be run either directly from the command line or by means of starting the corresponding
Docker image
created from it.
Service Configuration
In addition to the following options, this component supports the options described in
command
because it represents the default case.
The Command & Control API is defined by means of AMQP 1.0 message exchanges, i.e. a client needs to connect to Hono using AMQP 1.0 in order to invoke operations of the API as described in the following sections. Throughout the remainder of this page we will simply use AMQP when referring to AMQP 1.0.
Send a One-Way Command
Business Applications use this operation to send a command to a device for which they do not expect to receive a response from the device.
Preconditions
The
Business Application
has established an AMQP connection with the AMQP 1.0 Network.
The
Business Application
has established an AMQP link in role
sender
with the target address
, where
is the ID of the tenant that the device belongs to. This link is used by the
Business Application
to send command messages.

Credentials Service Connection Configuration
Protocol adapters require a connection to an implementation of Hono’s
Credentials API
in order to retrieve credentials stored for devices that needs to be authenticated. During connection establishment, the adapter uses the Credentials API to retrieve the credentials on record for the device and matches that with the credentials provided by a device.
The connection to the Credentials Service is configured according to

HONO_COAP_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
variable is set to
false
because CoAP authenticates clients (devices) as part of the DTLS handshake. Thus, requiring devices to authenticate effectively rules out setting up a non-DTLS secured port.
Dual Port
The protocol adapter may be configured to open both a secure and a non-secure port at the same time simply by configuring both ports as described above. For this to work, both ports must be configured to use different port numbers, otherwise startup will fail.
Ephemeral Ports
Both the secure as well as the insecure port numbers may be explicitly set to
0
. The protocol adapter will then use arbitrary (unused) port numbers determined by the operating system during startup.
Authentication
The CoAP protocol is UDP based and as such uses the DTLS protocol to secure the communication between a client (device) and a server (adapter). The CoAP adapter also uses the DTLS handshake to prove its identity to devices and to authenticate the devices themselves. The DTLS protocol allows for different
cipher suites
to be used for doing so. These suites mainly differ from each other in the type of secret being used for proving the participants’ identity to each other. One class of suites is based on a secret that is shared between the client and the server, very much like in a username/password based authentication scheme. This class of suites is called
pre-shared key
or PSK-based and is very popular for use cases where the devices are very constrained regarding CPU and memory. Another class of cipher suites is based on certificates which use asymmetric encryption for proving possession of the secret (the private key). The CoAP adapter supports cipher suites from both classes but only supports
elliptic curve cryptography
(ECC) based keys for the latter class of cipher suites.

Known bugs and limitations
Only the simple
URL
We have covered messaging needs for telemetry traffic. But what about events and command messages that require a genuine guarantee of delivery? Dispatch routers can be configured to “auto link” certain addresses to external AMQP 1.0 containers. In this way, we can route messages through the broker queue and provide “at least once” delivery guarantees for events and commands.
In the default deployment, Hono uses
Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Broker
. It provides a scalable AMQP 1.0 message broker; its queuing capabilities are used to store event messages.
Of course, you can use any AMQP 1.0-compatible message broker for this. Or provide more scalable and more reliable solutions by using broker clusters and high-availability configurations. In addition, the default deployment of a single router and broker can be replaced with a scalable AMQP 1.0 cloud messaging platform – such as the one described later in this article.
Solution tier
All solutions connect to the AMQP 1.0 network and receive messages from the messaging endpoints.
/telemetry/<tenant>/<device>
or
/event/<tenant>/<device>
They do not themselves need to integrate specific IoT protocols and benefit from the flow control of the AMQP 1.0 network.

Using multi-tenancy in Eclipse Hono

Most business applications in the Internet of Things work with data produced by devices that are connected to the application over public Internet infrastructure. The
Eclipse Hono
project can be leveraged by such applications to abstract away the particular communication protocols used by the devices, thus allowing the application to ingest data published by devices using a uniform AMQP 1.0 based API. You can find an overview of Hono’s features and capabilities in a
previous blog post.
With Hono 0.6-M2 having been published just recently, it is time to take a closer look at its new

Credentials
and
Tenant
APIs. Protocol adapters use these APIs to determine a device’s registration status, e.g. if it is enabled and if it is registered with a particular tenant, and to authenticate a device before accepting any data for processing from it. In addition to the above, this Device Registry also provides an implementation of
Device Registry Management APIs
for managing tenants, registration information and credentials of devices.
The Device Registry is implemented as a Spring Boot application, and the data is persisted in a MongoDB database. It can be run either directly from the command line or by means of starting the corresponding
Docker image
created from it.

The LoraWAN protocol adapter has been extended with support for the
Orbiwise
provider.
Added metrics for tracking the RTT between sending an AMQP message to receiving the disposition.
The CoAP adapter now supports configuration of the
timeoutToAck
parameter at the tenant level in addition to the adapter level. If set, the tenant specific value is used for all devices of the particular tenant. If not set, the value defined at the adapter level is used.
The Device Registry Management API has been extended now to support searching devices for a tenant with optional filters, paging and sorting options. Please refer to the
Device registry management API
for details.
The MongoDB based device registry now supports searching devices for a tenant with optional filters, paging and sorting options.
Fixes & Enhancements
The MongoDB based device registry now checks for tenant existence during device registration and credentials management operations.
Deprecations
The configuration property
singleTenant
of the protocol adapters and the device registry is now deprecated and planned to be removed in a future release. The use case of a system with just a single tenant should be realized by configuring just one tenant in the device registry.

Eclipse Hono™ comes with an
Apache JMeter
plugin which provides
samplers
that can be used in JMeter test plans to send and receive telemetry/event data.
The plugin provides a
Hono Receiver Sampler
which can be used together with JMeter’s standard
HTTP Sampler
and XMeter’s
JMeter plugin for MQTT
to play the roles of a downstream application (consumer) and devices uploading data to the HTTP and MQTT protocol adapters. The diagram below illustrates how the components are related to each other.

Eclipse Hono: Connect. Command. Control.
The open source counterpart to closed and proprietary IoT solutions is called Hono ! Born out of the collaboration of big companies, including Red Hat and Bosch both members of the Eclipse Foundation, Hono is an open source framework which aims to add features, such as device management and authentication, on top of an highly scalable messaging infrastructure in order to guarantee secured data exchange between devices and cloud applications. Using its APIs, devices can send data (telemetry and event) and can be controlled remotely (command/control). During this session we will see the “bricks” that make its architecture, the exposed APIs and the integration with other solutions.

When enabling the secure port without configuring an ECC based key and certificate, the adapter will only use PSK based cipher suites for authentication. When configuring an ECC based key and certificate, the adapter will also offer certificate based cipher suites to the client to use for authentication.
In any case the device’s credentials need to be registered with the device registry. Please refer to the
Standard Credential Types
and the
Device Registry Management API
for additional information.

The Protocol Gateway approach is the
officially
supported and recommended one. If you are planning to deploy and operate Hono yourself, you can, of course, also implement a Protocol Adapter.

Hono Messaging and the protocol adapters report different kinds of metrics to an InfluxDB, which can be viewed using the Grafana dashboards provided. Please refer to
Getting Started
for details.
APIs and their endpoints
Hono’s internal APIs are defined as AMQP 1.0 endpoints:
Protocol adapters use Hono’s internal APIs to:
authenticate the device using the
Credentials API
check the status of the device using the
Registration API
forward device messages to the AMQP network using the
Telemetry
or
Event API
As with the AMQP 1.0 network, flow control also enables the load protection regarding devices.
The Device Registry also implements RESTful variants of the Registration APIs and the Credentials APIs in order to support the administration of devices. This leverages the use of CLI tools like curl and simplifies implementation of a complex
Device Operations Console
multi-tenancy
capabilities.
Ensuring Data Privacy
Hono allows devices to be grouped into
tenants
. A tenant may represent any kind of organizational or technical domain that the devices are part of. Each device must be assigned to exactly one tenant. The diagram below shows the relationship between tenants and devices.
Source: http://yuml.me/54e46552.png
Tenants and Devices
Examples of tenants include:
a customer
an application
devices of a particular type (e.g. temperature sensors)
Once assigned, Hono makes sure that data produced by devices of a particular tenant can only be consumed by clients that have been explicitly authorized for that tenant. Because the data is kept private to each tenant, it makes a lot of sense to set up a single, highly scalable Hono installation in a cloud environment, making efficient use of computing and networking resources while sharing the operating costs between the tenants.
In the remainder of this blog post we will walk through an example of how to set up multiple tenants in Hono, register devices with these tenants, and consume data produced by the devices securely and privately.

Message Limits
The adapter
discards any MQTT PUBLISH packet containing telemetry data or an event that is sent by a client and
rejects any AMQP 1.0 message containing a command sent by a north bound application
if the
message limit
that has been configured for the device’s tenant is exceeded.
Connection Events
The adapter can emit
Connection Events
for client connections being established and/or terminated. Please refer to the

A few thoughts on work life-balance
The
HONO_REGISTRY_REST_*
configuration properties of the file based device registry have been deprecated in favor of corresponding properties with the
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_
prefix.
1.3.0
New Features
The LoraWAN protocol adapter has been extended with support for the
ChirpStack
provider.
Hono’s integration tests can now be run with a Jaeger back end in order to collect tracing information.
The AMQP 1.0 event message based Connection Event producer now sets a TTL on the event messages it produces. The TTL is the
max TTL
configured at the tenant level.
A new Device Registry implementation based on MongoDB database is now available in Hono. Please refer to the
MongoDB Device Registry User Guide
for additional information.
Hono protocol adapters can now be configured to use address rewriting when opening AMQP 1.0 links to the messaging network. This allows an easier deployment in multi-tenant messaging environments. Please refer to the

to the
<jmeter-installation>/lib/ext
folder.
Start JMeter
Example Test Plans
The
<hono-installation>/jmeter/src/jmeter
folder contains several JMeter test plans which you can use as a basis for your own tests. All test plans can be run against Hono’s
example deployment
.
http_messaging_throughput_test.jmx
runs a set of HTTP clients and AMQP 1.0 consumers for a given period of time. The senders publish data to Hono’ HTTP adapter while the consumers receive messages from the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network (in case of the example installation this is the Qpid Dispatch Router). The test plan measures the number of messages that are sent/received during the test execution.
mqtt_messaging_throughput_test.jmx
runs a set of MQTT clients and AMQP 1.0 consumers for a given period of time. The clients publish data to Hono’ MQTT adapter while the consumers receive messages from the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network (in case of the example installation this is the Qpid Dispatch Router). The test plan measures the number of messages that are sent/received during the test execution. To use this plan you also need to add the
JMeter plugin for MQTT
to your JMeter plugin path.
amqp_messaging_throughput_test.jmx
runs a set of AMQP 1.0 senders and consumers for a given period of time. The senders publish data to the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network directly while the consumers receive messages from the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network (in case of the example installation this is the Qpid Dispatch Router). The test plan measures the number of messages that are sent/received during the test execution.
Protocol adapters use these APIs to determine a device’s registration status, e.g. if it is enabled and if it is registered with a particular tenant, and to authenticate a device before accepting any data for processing from it.
There is no particular technical reason to implement these three APIs in one component, so for production scenarios there might be up to three different components each implementing one of the API’s.
The Device Registry component also exposes
HTTP based resources
for managing tenants and the registration information and credentials of devices.
The Device Registry is implemented as a Spring Boot application. It can be run either directly from the command line or by means of starting the corresponding
Docker image
created from it.
Service Configuration
In addition to the following options, this component supports the options described in
Common Configuration
.
The following table provides an overview of the configuration variables and corresponding command line options for configuring the Device Registry.

Description
HTTP Adapter
The HTTP protocol adapter exposes HTTP based endpoints for Eclipse Hono™’s south bound Telemetry, Event and Command & Control APIs.
Device Authentication
The HTTP adapter by default requires clients (devices or gateway components) to authenticate during connection establishment. The adapter supports both the
Basic HTTP authentication scheme
as well as client certificate based authentication as part of a TLS handshake for that purpose.
The adapter tries to authenticate the device using these mechanisms in the following order
Client Certificate
When a device uses a client certificate for authentication during the TLS handshake, the adapter tries to determine the tenant that the device belongs to, based on the
issuer DN
contained in the certificate. In order for the lookup to succeed, the tenant’s trust anchor needs to be configured by means of
registering the trusted certificate authority
. The device’s client certificate will then be validated using the registered trust anchor, thus implicitly establishing the tenant that the device belongs to. In a second step, the adapter then uses the Credentials API’s
get
operation with the client certificate’s
The following operations can be used by
Protocol Adapters
to forward event messages received from devices to downstream consumers like
Business Applications
.

NB
There is a subtle difference between the
device identifier
(
device-id
) and the
auth-id
a device uses for authentication. See
Device Identity
for a discussion of the concepts.
SASL EXTERNAL Authentication
When a device uses a client certificate for authentication, the TLS handshake is initiated during TCP connection establishment. If no trust anchor is configured for the AMQP adapter, the TLS handshake will succeed only if the certificate has not yet expired. Once the TLS handshake completes and a secure connection is established, the certificate’s signature is checked during the SASL handshake. To complete the SASL handshake and authenticate the client, the adapter performs the following steps:
The adapter extracts the client certificate’s
Issuer DN
from the client certificate
The adapter invokes the Tenant service to look up the tenant matching the DN. In order for the lookup to succeed, the tenant’s trust anchor needs to be configured by means of registering the
trusted certificate authority
See
Port Configuration
below for details.
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_CERT_PATH
--hono.deviceConnection.amqp.certPath
no
-
The absolute path to the PEM file containing the certificate that the server should use for authenticating to clients. This option must be used in conjunction with
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_KEY_PATH
.
Alternatively, the
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_KEY_STORE_PATH
option can be used to configure a key store containing both the key as well as the certificate.

RFC 2046
which describes the semantics and format of the command’s input data contained in the message payload. However, not all protocol adapters will support this property as not all transport protocols provide means to convey this information, e.g. MQTT 3.1.1 has no notion of message headers.
message-id
no
true
. A downstream consumer may then react according to the presence of this annotation.
Authentication
The MQTT adapter by default requires clients (devices or gateway components) to authenticate during connection establishment. The adapter supports both the authentication based on the username/password provided in an MQTT CONNECT packet as well as client certificate based authentication as part of a TLS handshake for that purpose.
The adapter tries to authenticate the device using these mechanisms in the following order
Client Certificate
When a device uses a client certificate for authentication during the TLS handshake, the adapter tries to determine the tenant that the device belongs to based on the
issuer DN
contained in the certificate. In order for the lookup to succeed, the tenant’s trust anchor needs to be configured by means of registering the
trusted certificate authority
. The device’s client certificate will then be validated using the registered trust anchor, thus implicitly establishing the tenant that the device belongs to. In a second step, the adapter uses the Credentials API’s
get
operation to retrieve the credentials on record, including the client certificate’s
subject DN
as the
auth-id
: A media type describing the semantics and format of payload contained in the response body. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device which requires input data. Note that this option will be empty if the media type contained in the command (AMQP) message’s
content-type
property cannot be mapped to one of the registered CoAP
content-format
codes.
(optional)
location-query
: The
hono-command
query parameter contains the name of the command to execute. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
(optional)
location-path
: The location path is
command
for one-way-commands and
command_response/<command-request-id>
for commands expecting a response. In the latter case, the
HONO_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS
--hono.http.bindAddress
no
127.0.0.1
The IP address of the network interface that the secure port should be bound to.

no
-
The absolute path to the PEM file containing the certificate that the protocol adapter should use for authenticating to clients. This option must be used in conjunction with
HONO_HTTP_KEY_PATH
.
Alternatively, the
HONO_HTTP_KEY_STORE_PATH
option can be used to configure a key store containing both the key as well as the certificate.

.
HONO_AUTH_SVC_SIGNING_KEY_PATH
--hono.auth.svc.signing.keyPath
no
-
The absolute path to the (PKCS8) PEM file containing the private key that the server should use for signing tokens asserting an authenticated client’s identity and authorities. When using this variable, other services that need to validate the tokens issued by this service need to be configured with the corresponding certificate/public key. Alternatively, a symmetric key can be used for signing (and validating) by setting the
HONO_AUTH_SVC_SIGNING_SHARED_SECRET
variable. If none of these variables is set, the server falls back to the key indicated by the
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_KEY_PATH
variable. If that variable is also not set, startup of the server fails.
HONO_AUTH_SVC_SIGNING_SHARED_SECRET
--hono.auth.svc.signing.sharedSecret
no
is set to
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION
.
Responses from the Device Connection service are never cached, so the properties for configuring the cache are ignored.
Direct Connection to Data Grid
Protocol adapters can alternatively be configured to directly access a data grid for storing and retrieving device connection information using
Infinispan
’s Hotrod protocol. This has the advantage of saving the network hop to the Device Connection service. However, this is only beneficial if the Device Connection service implementation itself uses a remote service (like a data grid) for storing the data.

How to get historical sensor data of a registered Hono Device
I am trying to send the below sensor values from the registered device in Hono to Ditto in order to form the digital twin of the registered device. I am using the below command. curl -X POST -i -u ...
with overlapping validity periods for device

Credential Verification
Protocol Adapters are responsible for authenticating devices when they connect. The Credentials API provides the
Get Credentials
operation to support Protocol Adapters in doing so as illustrated below:
The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of messages involved in a
Protocol Adapter
authenticating a device. This is shown for the
MQTT Protocol Adapter
as example how a device authenticates with a username and a hashed-password. The mechanism can be transferred to other protocols in a similar manner.
MQTT Adapter authenticates device using the Credentials service
Protocol adapters MUST comply with the following rules when verifying credentials presented by a device:
Credentials that have their
enabled

Location
AMQP Type
Description
content-type
no
properties
string
MUST be set to
application/json
if the invocation of the operation was successful and the body of the response message contains payload as described below.
The result of a successful invocation is carried in a single Data section of the response message as a UTF-8 encoded string representation of a single JSON object. It is an error to include payload that is not of this type.
The response message JSON object has the following properties:
Name
Mandatory
JSON Type
Description
-
The type of the adapter which this configuration belongs to.
enabled
no
boolean
false
If set to false the tenant is not allowed to receive / send data utilizing the given adapter.
device-authentication-required
no
boolean
true
If set to false, devices are not required to authenticate with the adapter before sending / receiving data.
Protocol adapters SHOULD use the configuration properties set for a tenant when interacting with devices of that tenant, e.g. in order to make authorization decisions etc.
The JSON object MAY contain an arbitrary number of additional members with arbitrary names of either scalar or complex type. This allows for future
well-known
additions and also allows to add further information which might be relevant to a

Maven
Git
Getting the Hono Source Code
Starting the Hono Build Process
Perform the integration tests
Building from Source
Hono can be deployed using the pre-built Docker images available from our
Docker Hub repositories
This page provides step by step instructions for getting the source code and building the Hono’s Docker images from it.
Prerequisites for building Hono
(which is not part of Hono itself).
Deployment options
All microservices are built as Docker images and are available on Docker Hub. The following container management systems are supported based on the Docker images:
Kubernetes
OpenShift
Docker Swarm
Deployments can be executed either
on premise
or hosted in a
public cloud
. On premise deployments work well for a small number of devices or test setups; a public cloud deployment is better for large installations that can scale dynamically per number of connected devices.
You can set up Hono yourself or use the sandbox deployment, which is accessible at hono.eclipse.org. The following steps assume you have Hono running locally:
Register a device by using the REST API of the device registry
Start a consumer; refer to
Getting Started
for details.
provided by the Eclipse Foundation.
The sandbox is specifically intended to be used for experimenting and testing purposes. It comes with a simple Device Registry component which exposes an HTTP based API for managing tenants, devices and credentials.
When a device connects to one of Hono’s protocol adapters in order to publish data, Hono authenticates the device and verifies its registration status by means of information retrieved from the Device Registry.
Adding Tenants
Each tenant is required to have a unique identifier. The identifier is a string of arbitrary length.
We will use the following command to add a new tenant using
acme-corporation
as the identifier. Please make sure to pick another (non-existing) identifier when following the example. Otherwise the command will fail with a
409 Conflict
, indicating that a tenant with that identifier already exists.
In the same way, another tenant can be created:
Registering Devices
Having created the tenants, the next step is to register the devices. Similar to a tenant, a device must have an identifier which is unique
within the tenant

The adapter includes the
client identifier
from the client’s MQTT CONNECT packet as the Connection Event’s
remote-id
.
Publishing Data
Once the gateway has established a connection to the Kura adapter, all
control
and
data
messages published by applications running on the gateway are sent to the adapter and mapped to Hono’s Telemetry and Event API endpoints as follows:
The adapter treats all messages that are published to a topic starting with the configured
HONO_KURA_CONTROL_PREFIX
as control messages. All other messages are considered to be data messages.
control
messages with QoS 0 are forwarded to Hono’s telemetry endpoint whereas messages with QoS 1 are forwarded to the event endpoint. The corresponding AMQP 1.0 messages that are sent downstream have a content type of
Minikube
project. This kind of setup is sufficient for evaluation and development purposes. Please refer to Minikube’s
getting started guide
for instructions on how to set up a cluster locally.
The recommended settings for a Minikube VM used for running Hono’s example setup are as follows:
cpus
: 2
memory
: 8192 (MB)
The command to start the VM will look something like this:
After the Minikube VM has started successfully, the
minikube tunnel
command should be run in order to support Hono’s services being deployed using the
LoadBalancer
type. Please refer to the
Minikube Loadbalancer docs
for details.

From the Hono docs:
The device registry may choose to not return information which is not suitable for authentication a device. This includes for example the enabled property. If set to false, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.

Hono Client Configuration Guide
for additional information.
Fixes & Enhancements
An admin guide for the CoAP adapter has been added.
The Prometheus based resource limits checker now supports configuring a query timeout. Please refer to
Resource Limits Checker Configuration
for additional information.
When sending a command message to a device, the AMQP adapter now waits for a configurable period of time (default is 1 second) for the acknowledgement from the device. If none is received, the downstream command sender gets back a
released
outcome. Please refer to the
sendMessageToDeviceTimeout
property description in the AMQP Adapter admin guide for additional information.
The client for storing device connection information to a data grid now supports configuring the name of the cache to store the data in.
When the connection to a device is closed or lost, a protocol adapter instance will now stop listening for commands targeted at the device.
The AMQP adapter before accepting any connections checks if the connection limit is exceeded or not and if the adapter is enabled or not. These checks are currently done inside the
AmqpAdapterSaslAuthenticatorFactory
. Thereby, if any of these checks failed, the AMQP adapter reported authentication failure instead of the actual reason. This has been fixed now.

A string to derive a symmetric key from that is used for signing tokens asserting an authenticated client’s identity and authorities. The key is derived from the string by using the bytes of the String’s UTF8 encoding. When setting the signing key using this variable, other services that need to validate the tokens issued by this service need to be configured with the same key. Alternatively, an asymmetric key pair can be used for signing (and validating) by setting the

Docker
Creating Hono’s container images using the Hono build process requires a
Docker
daemon running either locally or on another host you have access to. Please follow the instructions on the
Docker web site
to install Docker on your platform.
Java
Hono is written in Java and therefore requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher installed on your computer. Please follow the JDK vendor’s instructions for installing Java on your operating system.
Maven
Hono’s build process is based on
Apache Maven
. You need at least Maven 3.5 in order to build Hono. Please follow the
installation instructions on the Maven home page
.
Git
A Git client is required if you want to contribute changes/improvements to the Hono project. It is not necessary for simply building Hono locally. Please refer to the
Git Downloads page
for installation instructions.
Upload data using the HTTP adapter.
Observe the consumer receiving the data.
Scale it up!
Hono is fundamentally designed for horizontal scalability. This is reflected in its microservices architecture:
protocol adapters can be scaled independently from the messaging infrastructure itself.
solutions are decoupled from Hono by the AMQP 1.0 network layer, which can be scaled independently from Hono itself.
the device registry is separated from the messaging components and, consequently, can be scaled independently as well.
You can use the scaling strategy of your container management system to scale the microservices you need. The internally used AMQP 1.0 protocol is designed for scalability and very large networks.
EnMasse – the elastic messaging infrastructure
Because Eclipse Hono is not itself a messaging system, it needs an underlying messaging infrastructure to work. Messages are exchanged between all internal components and sent from external devices to and from business applications. We refer to this type of infrastructure as the “AMQP 1.0 Network” in the overall Eclipse Hono architecture. As noted elsewhere, the off-the-shelf solution consists of the Qpid Dispatch Router and the ActiveMQ Artemis Broker.
The Eclipse Hono architecture was designed and developed in such a way that the underlying messaging infrastructure can be modified – provided that it is based on AMQP 1.0. This means you can use RabbitMQ with the AMQP 1.0 plugin, for example, or any other messaging broker implementing the AMQP 1.0 protocol.
Big numbers? We need elasticity!
When it comes to supporting a large number of connected devices and high throughput in terms of exchanged messages, the “single router, single broker” solution has its limits.
The messaging infrastructure needs to grow, and the
scalability
becomes the most important criterion for allowing Eclipse Hono to handle devices and consumers as well as the tremendous traffic associated with them.
that it is registered with. The following examples register one device with each of the tenants created above.
You can either use the same device identifiers shown in the code snippets below or create your own identifiers. Just make sure that you are using the same device identifiers when you set the devices’ credentials as described in the next section.
Registering device
foo-bar-1
with tenant
foo-bar-corporation
:
Setting Credentials
The final step before the devices can actually start publishing data to Hono is to set
credentials
for the devices. Hono requires a device to authenticate using these credentials before it accepts any data published by the device. This way, applications consuming the data via Hono’s Telemetry or Event APIs can be sure that the data originates from the device indicated in the telemetry message or event.
Eclipse Hono is designed to support multiple types of credentials, supporting authentication schemes like HTTP Basic auth, MQTT username/password authentication, X.509 client certificates and other TLS ciphers that support client authentication using Pre-Shared Keys or RawPublicKeys.
However, for the sake of simplicity, we will use simple
hashed-password
credentials which the devices can use to authenticate with the HTTP protocol adapter using HTTP Basic Auth or with the MQTT adapter.
As the name suggests, the Device Registry does not store any passwords in clear text but instead stores a hash of the password only. In order to authenticate a device, a protocol adapter retrieves the hashed password from the registry and compares it to a locally computed hash of the password provided by the device. If the hashes match, the device is authenticated and its data is accepted.
Setting credentials for a device requires upfront computation of the password hash. The hash can then be used in an HTTP request to set the credentials for a device.

Minikube will use the most recent Kubernetes version that was available when it has been compiled by default. Hono
should
run on any version of Kubernetes starting with 1.13.6. However, it has been tested with several specific versions only. The most recent version known to work is 1.15.4 so if you experience any issues with running Hono on another version, please try to deploy to 1.15.4 before raising an issue. You can use Minikube’s

The AMQP adapter did not consider the
HONO_CONNECTIONEVENTS_PRODUCER
configuration variable to set a Connection Event producer. This has been fixed.
The
logging
Connection Event producer now supports configuring the level at which information should be logged. The producer type
none
has been added to explicitly turn off connection event reporting altogether. Please refer to the

has been made to deliver the command to the device. However, it is unclear if the device has received (or processed) the command.
The device has acknowledged the reception of the command but has not processed the command yet.

4.00 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons include:
the request body is empty and the
URI-query
option doesn’t contain the
empty
parameter
4.03 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The given tenant is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.
4.04 (Not Found): The request cannot be processed because the device is disabled or does not exist.
4.13 (Request Entity Too Large): The request cannot be processed because the request body exceeds the maximum supported size.
4.29 (Too Many Requests): The request cannot be processed because the tenant’s message limit for the current period is exceeded.
5.03 (Service Unavailable): The request cannot be processed because there is no consumer of telemetry data for the given tenant connected to Hono.
This is the preferred way for devices to publish telemetry data. It is available only if the protocol adapter is configured to require devices to authenticate (which is the default).

The variables only need to be set if the default value does not match your environment.
Port Configuration
The Auth Server can be configured to listen for connections on
a secure port only (default) or
an insecure port only or
both a secure and an insecure port (dual port configuration)
The server will fail to start if none of the ports is configured properly.
Secure Port Only
The server needs to be configured with a private key, a certificate holding the public key and a trust store in order to open a TLS secured port.
There are two alternative ways for setting the private key and certificate:
Setting the
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_KEY_STORE_PATH
and the
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD
variables in order to load the key & certificate from a password protected key store, or
setting the
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_KEY_PATH
and
In general, the service supports all configuration properties of the
Infinispan Hotrod client
using
hono.deviceConnection
instead of the
infinispan.client.hotrod
prefix.

Connecting Eclipse Hono and Ditto
All credential types used with Hono MUST contain
device-id
,
type
,
auth-id
,
enabled
and
secrets
properties as defined in
Credentials Format
.
Hashed Password
A credential type for storing a (hashed) password for a device.
Example:
Name
Mandatory
device-id
yes
string
The ID of the gateway or device that the protocol adapter instance given by the
adapter-instance-id
is handling command & control messages for. This ID is not necessarily the
device_id
given in the request message, it may be the ID of one of the gateways acting on behalf of the device.
An example of a response message with a single adapter instance result, returned for example if an adapter instance is registered for the given device:
An example of a response message with multiple contained adapter instances, returned for example if no adapter instance is registered for the given device or its last used gateway, and therefore a list of all adapter instances for the gateways of the device is returned:
The response message’s
status
property may contain the following codes:

Description
200
OK, the payload contains the adapter instances.
-1
The maximum time-to-live (in seconds) to use for events published by devices of this tenant. Any default TTL value specified at either the tenant or device level will be limited to the max value specified here. If this property is set to a value greater than
-1
and no default TTL is specified for a device, the max value will be used for events published by the device. A value of
-1
(the default) indicates that no limit is set.
Note
that this property contains the TTL in
seconds
whereas the AMQP 1.0 specification defines a message’s
ttl
header to use milliseconds.
connection-duration
no
object
-
The maximum connection duration allowed for the given tenant. Refer to
Connection Duration Configuration Format
Getting the Hono Source Code
Either
download the latest
release archive
and extract the archive to a local folder or
clone the Hono source code repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/hono.git
This will create a

device can be set in the same way:
Publishing & Consuming Data
In order to consume telemetry data or events that have been published by devices, a client needs to connect to Hono’s Telemetry and/or Event API using AMQP 1.0.
Hono provides an example Java client that can be used to consume data from Hono. You can get the client from the
download page
(in the
Latest Milestone
section).

org.eclipse.hono.service.registration

have been moved from the

The Device Connection service did return a 500 error code if no
last known gateway
could be found for a device ID. This has been fixed so that the service now returns a 404 in that case as specified by the Device Connection API.
The cache based Device Connection service implementation now applies a lifespan of 28 days when setting/updating cache entries containing
last known gateway
information. This means no global expiration configuration is needed anymore for the cache.

From the Hono docs:
The device registry may choose to not return information which is not suitable for authentication a device. This includes for example the enabled property. If set to false, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.

Hono’s HTTP adapter allows devices to indicate, which delivery semantics they want to use when uploading telemetry data. The HTTP adapter always forwards messages unsettled and either ignores the outcome of the message transfer (

) or waits for the downstream peer to accept the message (
AT LEAST ONCE
) before acknowledging the reception of the message to the device.

400
Bad Request, the request message does not contain all required information/properties.
404
Not Found, there is no command-handling adapter instance assigned to the device.
Implementors of this API may also return a
404
status code in order to indicate that no device with the given identifier exists for the given tenant. However, performing such a check is optional.
For status codes indicating an error (codes in the
400 - 499
range) the message body MAY contain a detailed description of the error that occurred.
Standard Message Properties
Due to the nature of the request/response message pattern of the operations of the Device Connection API, there are some standard properties shared by all of the request and response messages exchanged as part of the operations.
Standard Request Properties
The following table provides an overview of the properties shared by all request messages regardless of the particular operation being invoked.
Name
Mandatory
Location
for details.
data-volume
no
object
-
The maximum data volume allowed for the given tenant. Refer to
Data Volume Configuration Format

Protocol adapters SHOULD use the
max-connections
property to determine if a device’s connection request should be accepted or rejected.
Protocol adapters SHOULD use the
max-ttl
property to determine the
effective time-to-live
for events published by devices as follows:
If a non-default
max-ttl
-Ddocker.host
property definition.
If you plan to build the Docker images more frequently, e.g. because you want to extend or improve the Hono code, then you should define the
docker.host
property in your Maven
settings.xml
file containing the very same value as you would use on the command line as indicated above. The file is usually located in the
.m2
folder in your user’s home directory. This way you can simply do a
mvn clean install
later on and the Docker images will be built automatically as well because the
build-docker-image
profile is activated automatically if the Maven property
docker.host
is set.
Be patient
The first build might take several minutes because Docker will need to download all the base images that Hono is relying on. However, most of these will be cached by Docker so that subsequent builds will be running much faster.
open source “messaging as a service”
platform
which simplifies the deployment of a messaging infrastructure both “on premise” and in the cloud. It provides the scalability and elasticity needed to support the messaging requirements for IoT use cases.
Moreover, EnMasse supports all common
messaging patterns
(request/reply, publish/subscribe, and competing consumers) and two
main protocols
: AMQP 1.0 and MQTT. Adding HTTP support is on the roadmap.
EnMasse provides
multi-tenancy
, meaning that different tenants can share the same infrastructure – but are isolated from each other. Finally, it provides
security
with respect to securing connections using TLS, but also authenticating clients using
Keycloak
as the identity management system.
Another aspect that makes EnMasse appealing to use with Eclipse Hono: it is completely
containerized
and runs on
After the download has finished, start the client from the command line like this:
$> java -jar hono-example-0.6-M2-exec.jar --hono.client.host=hono.eclipse.org --hono.client.port=15672 --hono.client.username=consumer@HONO --hono.client.password=verysecret --spring.profiles.active=receiver --tenant.id=acme-corporation
NB:
Make sure to set the value of the
–tenant.id
parameter to the name of your tenant.
Once the client is running, the following command can be used to publish some telemetry data for the
acme-1
device. Make sure to adapt the command to use the device identifier and password of the device that belongs to the tenant you started the client for.
Now try to start another client (on another console) to consume data from the other tenant:
$> java -jar hono-client.jar --hono.client.host=hono.eclipse.org --hono.client.port=15672 --hono.client.username=consumer@HONO --hono.client.password=verysecret --spring.profiles.active=receiver --tenant.id=foo-bar-corporation
NB:
Do not be confused by the fact that this uses the same user name and password as for the first tenant. This is just a limitation of the sandbox environment. In a production system, the clients will use different credentials specific to the tenant from which they want to consume data.
Now publish some data for the second tenant:

. The values of the default properties are determined as follows:
If the message already contains a non-empty property of the same name, the value if unchanged.
Otherwise, if a default property of the same name is defined in the device’s registration information, that value is used.
Otherwise, if a default property of the same name is defined for the tenant that the device belongs to, that value is used.
Note that of the standard AMQP 1.0 message properties only the
content-type
and
ttl
can be set this way to a default value.
Event Message Time-to-live
Events published by devices will usually be persisted by the AMQP Messaging Network in order to support deferred delivery to downstream consumers. In most cases the AMQP Messaging Network can be configured with a maximum
time-to-live
to apply to the events so that the events will be removed from the persistent store if no consumer has attached to receive the event before the message expires.
In order to support environments where the AMQP Messaging Network cannot be configured accordingly, the protocol adapter supports setting a downstream event message’s

property based on the default

Eclipse Hono - Command and Control
1. Eclipse HonoEclipse Hono Command and ControlCommand and Control Hono
Protocol adapters failed to re-establish receiver links for commands to be routed after loss of connection to the AMQP Messaging Network. This has been fixed.
The AMQP adapter reported an incorrect number of connections if resource limits had been defined and exceeded. This has been fixed.
The device registry management HTTP endpoints now reject requests to register or update objects containing unknown properties. In the past such properties had been simply ignored.
The Device Registry Management API has been amended with example messages and more thorough description of operations.
The CoAP adapter has been enhanced to asynchronously look up a device’s PSK during the DTLS handshake. This will allow the adapter to handle a lot more handshakes concurrently. The adapter also employs a more efficient message de-duplicator which reduces the adapter’s memory footprint.
API Changes
The

org.eclipse.hono.client.HonoConnection

The AMQP adapter supports the
Anonymous Terminus for Message Routing
specification and requires clients to create a single sender link using the
null
target address for publishing all types of messages to the AMQP adapter.
Using
AT MOST ONCE
delivery semantics, the client will not wait for the message to be accepted and settled by the downstream consumer. However, with
AT LEAST ONCE
, the client sends the message and waits for the message to be delivered to and accepted by the downstream consumer. If the message cannot be delivered due to a failure, the client will be notified.
The client indicates its preferred message delivery mode by means of the
snd-settle-mode
and
rcv-settle-mode
fields of its
attach
frame during link establishment. Clients should use

The

. This link is used by the
Business Application
to receive the response to the command from the device. This link’s source address is also used as the

The following sequence diagram illustrates the establishment of the required links:

In the example above the response actually contains payload that should be used as input to a command to be executed by the device. This is just for illustrative purposes.

network interfaces (be careful not to expose the port unintentionally to the outside world).
Insecure Port Only
The secure port will mostly be required for production scenarios. However, it might be desirable to expose a non-TLS secured port instead, e.g. for testing purposes. In any case, the non-secure port needs to be explicitly enabled either by
explicitly setting
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT
to a valid port number, or by
implicitly configuring the default AMQP port (5672) by simply setting
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_ENABLED
to
true
.
The server issues a warning on the console if
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT
is set to the default secure AMQP port (5671).
The
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_BIND_ADDRESS
variable can be used to specify the network interface that the port should be exposed on. By default the port is bound to the

The number of milliseconds after which a request to a Prometheus server is closed. Setting zero or a negative value disables the timeout.
In addition to the properties listed above, the resource limit checker also supports the properties listed below as documented in the

. These properties might be useful if a reverse proxy in front of the Prometheus server requires the client to use TLS and/or provide credentials for authentication.

Conclusion and outlook
This article covers the basics of the Eclipse Hono project as well as describes its APIs, architecture, and deployment options. There are many things still to come in this field. The Telemetry and Event APIs we described are only the first that have been implemented. Next on our to-do list: the

For the test case
JdbcBasedCredentialsServiceTest.testUpdateCredentialsSupportsUpdatingExistingSecrets
… the management side reports back two entries … which is correct … for the adapter side, it reports back only one, which is correct as well, because the other entry is still invalid for the adapter, and the adapter API doesn't hand out invalid entries
Jens Reimann
@ctron
From the Hono docs:
The device registry may choose to not return information which is not suitable for authentication a device. This includes for example the enabled property. If set to false, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.

templates to setup the AKS cluster. This might take a while.
Notes:
add the following parameter in case you want to opt for the Azure Service Bus as broker in the
Hono AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network
instead of deploying a (self-hosted) ActiveMQ Artemis into AKS:
serviceBus=true
add the following parameter to define the k8s version of the AKS cluster. The default as defined in the template
might not be supported
in your target Azure region, e.g.
kubernetesVersion=1.14.6
After the deployment is complete you can set your cluster in
kubectl
.
Next create retain storage for the device registry.
Now Hono can be installed to the AKS cluster as describe in the
Helm based installation

An error caused by the client side, e.g invalid message address, content-type, adapter disabled for tenant etc.
An error caused by the server side, e.g no downstream consumers registered, downstream connection loss etc.
For a client side error, the adapter settles the message transfer with the

loopback device
only, i.e. the port will only be accessible from the local host. This variable might be used to e.g. expose the non-TLS secured port on a local interface only, thus providing easy access from within the local network, while still requiring encrypted communication when accessed from the outside over public network infrastructure.
Setting this variable to
0.0.0.0
will let the port being bound to
all
network interfaces (be careful not to expose the port unintentionally to the outside world).
Dual Port
In test setups and some production scenarios Hono server may be configured to open one secure
and
one insecure port at the same time.
This is achieved by configuring both ports correctly (see above). The server will fail to start if both ports are configured to use the same port number.
Since the secure port may need different visibility in the network setup compared to the secure port, it has it’s own binding address
HONO_AUTH_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_BIND_ADDRESS
. This can be used to narrow the visibility of the insecure port to a local network e.g., while the secure port may be visible worldwide.
Ephemeral Ports
The server may be configured to open both a secure and a non-secure port at the same time simply by configuring both ports as described above. For this to work, both ports must be configured to use different port numbers, otherwise startup will fail.

For the test case

… the management side reports back two entries … which is correct … for the adapter side, it reports back only one, which is correct as well, because the other entry is still invalid for the adapter, and the adapter API doesn't hand out invalid entries

@ctron
From the Hono docs:
The device registry may choose to not return information which is not suitable for authentication a device. This includes for example the enabled property. If set to false, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.

outcome, indicating to the client that the message itself was OK but it cannot be delivered due to a failure beyond the control of the client. In the latter case, a client may attempt to re-send the message unaltered.
AMQP Command-line Client
For purposes of demonstrating the usage of the AMQP adapter, the
Hono CLI Module
contains an AMQP command-line client for interacting with the AMQP adapter. The client can be used to send telemetry or events and to receive/respond to command request messages.
The command-line client supports the following parameters (with default values):
--spring.profiles.active=amqp-send
: Profile for sending telemetry data or events to Hono.
--spring.profiles.active=amqp-command
: Profile for receiving and responding to command request messages.
--message.address
: The AMQP 1.0 message address (default:
telemetry
)
--message.payload
: The message payload body (default:
for a list of supported protocol names.
The variables only need to be set if the default value does not match your environment.
Port Configuration
The Device Connection component supports configuration of both, an AMQP based endpoint as well as an HTTP based endpoint proving RESTful resources for managing registration information and credentials. Both endpoints can be configured to listen for connections on
a secure port only (default) or
an insecure port only or
both a secure and an insecure port (dual port configuration)
The server will fail to start if none of the ports is configured properly.
Secure Port Only
The server needs to be configured with a private key and certificate in order to open a TLS secured port.
There are two alternative ways for doing so:
Setting the
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_KEY_STORE_PATH
and the
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD
variables in order to load the key & certificate from a password protected key store, or
setting the
string
MUST contain the command name to be executed by a device.
content-type
no
properties
string
If present, MUST contain a
Media Type
as defined by
RFC 2046
which describes the semantics and format of the command’s input data contained in the message payload. However, not all protocol adapters will support this property as not all transport protocols provide means to convey this information, e.g. MQTT 3.1.1 has no notion of message headers.
correlation-id
no
properties
string
MAY contain an ID used to correlate a response message to the original request. If set, it is used as the
correlation-id

Message Limits
The adapter
rejects a client’s connection attempt with return code
0x05
(
Connection Refused: not authorized
),
discards any MQTT PUBLISH packet containing telemetry data or an event that is sent by a client and
rejects any AMQP 1.0 message containing a command sent by a north bound application
if the
message limit
that has been configured for the device’s tenant is exceeded.
(optional)
content-format
: A media type describing the semantics and format of payload contained in the response body. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device which requires input data. Note that this option will be empty if the media type contained in the command (AMQP) message’s
content-type
property cannot be mapped to one of the registered CoAP
content-format
codes.
(optional)
location-query
: The
hono-command
query parameter contains the name of the command to execute. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
(optional)

HONO_HTTP_NATIVE_TLS_REQUIRED
--hono.http.nativeTlsRequired
no
false
The server will probe for OpenSLL on startup if a secure port is configured. By default, the server will fall back to the JVM’s default SSL engine if not available. However, if set to
true
, the server will fail to start at all in this case.

--hono.client.host
: The host name that the AMQP adapter is running on (default:
localhost
)
--hono.client.port
: The port that the adapter is listening for incoming connections (default:
5672
)
To run the client to send a telemetry message to Hono, open a terminal and execute the following:
The client prints the outcome of the operation to standard out. The outcome above (
Accepted
) indicates that the request to upload the data has succeeded.
NB
There are two JAR files in the hono/cli/target directory. The JAR to use for the client is the
hono-cli-$VERSION-exec.jar
and not the
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_KEY_PATH
and
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_CERT_PATH
variables in order to load the key and certificate from two separate PEM files in PKCS8 format.
When starting up, the server will bind a TLS secured socket to the default secure AMQP port 5671. The port number can also be set explicitly using the
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_PORT
variable.
The
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_BIND_ADDRESS
variable can be used to specify the network interface that the port should be exposed on. By default the port is bound to the
loopback device
only, i.e. the port will only be accessible from the local host. Setting this variable to
0.0.0.0
will let the port being bound to

Connection Events
The adapter can emit
Connection Events
for client connections being established and/or terminated. Please refer to the
common configuration options
for details regarding how to enable this behavior.
The adapter includes the
client identifier
from the client’s MQTT CONNECT packet as the Connection Event’s
remote-id
.
Publishing Telemetry Data
The MQTT adapter supports the publishing of telemetry data by means of MQTT
PUBLISH
packets using either QoS 0 or QoS 1. Using QoS 1 will result in the adapter sending an MQTT
PUBACK
packet to the client once the message has been settled with the
for commands expecting a response. In the latter case, the
location-path
option contains exactly the URI-path that the device must use when sending its response to the command. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
Response Body:
(optional) Arbitrary data serving as input to a command to be executed by the device, if status code is 2.05 (Content).
(optional) Error details, if status code is >= 4.00.
Response Codes:
2.04 (Changed): The data in the request body has been accepted for processing. The response may contain a command for the device to execute. Note that if the message type is
NON
(
at most once
semantics), this status code does
not
mean that the message has been delivered to any potential consumer (yet). However, if the message type is
CON
(
at least once
semantics), then the adapter waits for the message to be delivered and accepted by a downstream consumer before responding with this status code.

X.509 based device authentication in Eclipse Hono
Kai Hudalla
3 min
During the last few months, the media has been full of reports about
insecure
IoT devices that did not fulfill even the most basic security requirements. One of the concerns raised was the confidentiality of data being transferred from devices to cloud services provided by the manufacturers. In many cases, data is sent over public networks fully unencrypted, which is quite surprising, given that all of the popular TCP/IP-based transport protocols used in today’s IoT devices (e.g., HTTP and MQTT) support the negotiation and use of a secure (encrypted) transport channel by means of
Transport Layer Security
(TLS).
Eclipse Hono has supported the use of TLS in its HTTP and MQTT protocol adapters from the very beginning. The recently released 0.9-M2 milestone has added support for the authentication of devices using an X.509 client certificate as part of the TLS handshake for both the HTTP and the MQTT adapter. This allows devices to use a private/public key pair instead of a username and password for authenticating themselves to the protocol adapters.

instead.
1.2.4
Fixes & Enhancements
The
HonoConnection
implementation didn’t use a delay before a reconnect attempt after a certain number of reconnect attempts (58 with the default configuration) had already failed. This has been fixed.
An error when freeing Command & Control related resources of an idle tenant has been fixed.
The Hotrod based DeviceConnectionClientFactory has been improved to prevent locking of objects in a clustered cache.
The AMQP adapter reported an incorrect number of connections if resource limits had been defined and exceeded. This has been fixed.
1.2.3
Fixes & Enhancements
The Device Connection service did return a 500 error code if no
last known gateway
could be found for a device ID. This has been fixed so that the service now returns a 404 in that case as specified by the Device Connection API.
The cache based Device Connection service implementation now applies a lifespan of 28 days when setting/updating cache entries containing

The content type header is missing.
The request body is empty.
The QoS header value is invalid.

An empty notification can be used to indicate to a
Business Application
that a device is currently ready to receive an upstream message by setting the
ttd
property.
Backend Applications
may use this information to determine the time window during which the device will be able to receive a command.
Connection Event
Protocol Adapters may send this type of event to indicate that a connection with a device has been established or has ended. Note that such events can only be sent for authenticated devices, though, because an event is always scoped to a tenant and the tenant of a device is established as part of the authentication process.

Publishing Telemetry Data
The client indicates the delivery mode to use when uploading telemetry messages by means of the
settled
and
rcv-settle-mode
properties of the AMQP
transfer
frame(s) it uses for uploading the message. The AMQP adapter will accept messages using a delivery mode according to the following table:
settled
rcv-settle-mode
Delivery semantics
false
first
The adapter will forward the message to the downstream AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network and will forward any AMQP
disposition
The secure port will mostly be required for production scenarios. However, it might be desirable to expose a non-TLS secured port instead, e.g. for testing purposes. In any case, the non-secure port needs to be explicitly enabled either by
explicitly setting
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT
to a valid port number, or by
implicitly configuring the default AMQP port (5672) by simply setting
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_ENABLED
to
true
.
The server issues a warning on the console if
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT
is set to the default secure AMQP port (5671).
The
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_BIND_ADDRESS
variable can be used to specify the network interface that the port should be exposed on. By default the port is bound to the
loopback device
only, i.e. the port will only be accessible from the local host. This variable might be used to e.g. expose the non-TLS secured port on a local interface only, thus providing easy access from within the local network, while still requiring encrypted communication when accessed from the outside over public network infrastructure.
MUST contain the source address that the application expects to receive the response from. This address MUST be the same as the source address used for establishing the client’s receiver link (see
Preconditions
above).
The command message MAY contain arbitrary payload to be sent to the device in a single AMQP
Data
section. The value of the command message’s
subject
value may provide a hint to the device regarding the format, encoding and semantics of the payload data.
Hono uses following AMQP delivery states to indicate the outcome of sending the command to the device:
Delivery State
Description
accepted
The command has been delivered to the device for processing.
released
The command has not been delivered to the device because the device is (currently) not connected.
rejected
The command has not been delivered to the device because it does not contain all required information.
accepted
outcome by the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network.
This requires that
the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network has capacity to process telemetry messages for the client’s tenant and
the messages published by the client comply with the format defined by the Telemetry API.
The protocol adapter checks the configured
message limit
before accepting any telemetry messages. If the message limit is exceeded or the incoming telemetry message cannot be processed, the connection to the client is closed.
Publish Telemetry Data (authenticated Device)
Topic:
telemetry
or
t
Authentication: required
Payload:
(required) Arbitrary payload
This is the preferred way for devices to publish telemetry data. It is available only if the protocol adapter is configured to require devices to authenticate (which is the default). When using this topic, the MQTT adapter determines the device’s tenant and device identity as part of the authentication process.
4.00 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons include:
the request body is empty and the
URI-query
option doesn’t contain the
empty
parameter
4.03 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The given tenant is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.
The given device does not belong to the given tenant.
4.04 (Not Found): The request cannot be processed because the device is disabled or does not exist.
4.13 (Request Entity Too Large): The request cannot be processed because the request body exceeds the maximum supported size.
4.29 (Too Many Requests): The request cannot be processed because the tenant’s message limit for the current period is exceeded.
5.03 (Service Unavailable): The request cannot be processed because there is no consumer of telemetry data for the given tenant connected to Hono.
This resource MUST be used by devices that have not authenticated to the protocol adapter. Note that this requires the

In this blog post I will walk you through a full example of how to create and register a tenant-specific
trust anchor
, create a certificate for a device, register its
subject distinguished name
and, finally, use the certificate to authenticate the device to Hono’s MQTT protocol adapter. In the remainder of this post, I will assume that you have a general understanding of RSA-based cryptography and, in particular, the roles played by private and public keys. For reference,
RFC 5280
defines all the technical details of X.509.
Why client certificates?
When employing passwords for authenticating devices, the password of each device needs to be registered with Hono’s Credentials service so the protocol adapters can compare the password presented by the device during authentication with the password’s hash on record.
One of the advantages of using client certificates for authenticating devices is that it is no longer necessary to register individual secrets (passwords) for devices with Hono. Instead, it is enough to register a single
trust anchor
for a tenant which can then be used to verify the identity of all devices belonging to the tenant as part of the TLS handshake. In order for this to work, the client certificates used by the devices must contain a digital signature which can be validated using the public key that serves as the tenant’s trust anchor.

unsettled
messages allows for clients to implement either
AT LEAST ONCE
or
AT MOST ONCE
delivery semantics, depending on whether a client actually waits for and considers the disposition frames it receives from the adapter or not. This is the recommended mode for uploading telemetry data.
true
first
The adapter will acknowledge and settle any received message spontaneously before forwarding it to the downstream AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network. The adapter will ignore any AMQP
disposition
frames it receives from the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network. Sending
pre-settled
messages allows for clients to implement
AT MOST ONCE
delivery semantics only. This is the fastest mode of delivery but has the drawback of less reliable end-to-end flow control and potential loss of messages without notice.
Setting this variable to
0.0.0.0
will let the port being bound to
all
network interfaces (be careful not to expose the port unintentionally to the outside world).
Dual Port
In test setups and some production scenarios Hono server may be configured to open one secure
and
one insecure port at the same time.
This is achieved by configuring both ports correctly (see above). The server will fail to start if both ports are configured to use the same port number.
Since the secure port may need different visibility in the network setup compared to the secure port, it has it’s own binding address
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_BIND_ADDRESS
. This can be used to narrow the visibility of the insecure port to a local network e.g., while the secure port may be visible worldwide.
Ephemeral Ports
The server may be configured to open both a secure and a non-secure port at the same time simply by configuring both ports as described above. For this to work, both ports must be configured to use different port numbers, otherwise startup will fail.
Data Grid Connection Configuration
Note
that Hono relies on the particular protocol adapter to deliver commands to devices. Depending on the used transport protocol and the adapter’s implementation, the
accepted
outcome may thus indicate any of the following:
An
attempt
has been made to deliver the command to the device. However, it is unclear if the device has received (or processed) the command.
The device has acknowledged the reception of the command but has not processed the command yet.
An application can determine the overall outcome of the operation by means of the response to the command that is sent back by the device. An application should consider execution of a command to have failed, if it does not receive a response within a reasonable amount of time.
Response Message Format
The following table provides an overview of the properties set on a message sent in response to a command.
Name

Publish some JSON data for device

Port Configuration
The HTTP protocol adapter can be configured to listen for connections on
a secure port only (default) or
an insecure port only or
both a secure and an insecure port (dual port configuration)
The HTTP protocol adapter will fail to start if none of the ports is configured properly.
Secure Port Only
The protocol adapter needs to be configured with a private key and certificate in order to open a TLS secured port.
There are two alternative ways for doing so:
Setting the
HONO_HTTP_KEY_STORE_PATH
and the
HONO_HTTP_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD
variables in order to load the key & certificate from a password protected key store, or
setting the

The first step, therefore, is to create the tenant’s public/private key pair that will be used to sign the client certificate(s) used by the tenant’s devices.
$ openssl genrsa -out tenant-key.pem 4096 $ openssl req -x509 -key tenant-key.pem -out tenant-cert.pem -days 365 -subj "/O=ACME Inc./CN=Sensors"
The subject distinguished name set using the `-subj` parameter may contain any valid X.500 distinguished name. However, in order to keep things simple you should refrain from using any attribute types apart from `CN`, `L`, `ST`, `O`, `OU`, `C`, `STREET`, `DC`, `UID`.
Register the tenant
Now that the keys have been created, we can register a tenant using the public key as the trust anchor.
For convenience we will be using the
Hono Sandbox
. However, any other (local) installation running version 0.9-M2 or later should work as well.
In the commands below, please replace the `ACME` tenant identifier with an identifier of your own choice. This is important because Hono enforces the uniqueness of tenant identifiers. Each identifier can therefore be registered once only per Hono instance.
The first three commands define some variables for later use: the tenant identifier, the certificate’s subject distinguished name and the Base64 encoded public key. The variables are then used in the command to register the trust anchor with the new tenant.
Create a device certificate
The next step is to create a key pair for the device and its corresponding client certificate, which is signed by the tenant’s private key.
$ openssl genrsa -out device-key.pem 4096 $ openssl req -new -key device-key.pem -subj "/O=ACME Inc./CN=Hot Fuzz Device" | openssl x509 -req -days 365 -out device-cert.pem -CA tenant-cert.pem -CAkey tenant-key.pem -CAcreateserial
Again, make sure to not use any attribute types apart from `CN`, `L`, `ST`, `O`, `OU`, `C`, `STREET`, `DC`, `UID` in the subject distinguished name.
Register the device
We can now use an arbitrary device identifier to register the device with the tenant.

The AMQP adapter didn’t report any metrics anymore. This has been fixed.
The CoAP and HTTP adapters’ user guide now correctly documents the 413 status code returned in response to a request that contains a payload exceeding the configured maximum size.
1.2.0
New Features
The protocol adapters can now be configured with a direct connection to a data grid for storing device connection information. This has the advantage of saving the network hop to the Device Connection service. Please refer to the protocol adapter Admin Guides for details.
The Prometheus based resource limits check can now be configured with a trust store, key material and/or a username and password in order to be able to connect to a Prometheus server that requires TLS and/or client authentication.
A Java client for the communication with the AMQP protocol adapter has been added. It can be used to implement devices, (protocol) gateways and for testing purposes. For more information refer to
AMQP Adapter Client for Java
.
Devices can now be configured with
groups
of gateways that are allowed to act on behalf of the device. This makes it easier to support scenarios in which a device may
roam
between multiple gateways. The HTTP based management API has been adapted accordingly.
The CoAP adapter now supports forwarding commands to devices in the response body of requests for uploading telemetry data and/or events, analogous to the HTTP adapter. Please note that the CoAP adapter is still considered
experimental
and its device facing API is therefore still subject to change.

Hono delivers messages containing telemetry data reported by a particular device in the same order that they have been received in (using the

Register the device’s subject DN
The final step is to register the device’s subject distinguished name. Again, make sure to use the same tenant and device identifiers as above.
Test the connection
Now that the device has been registered, it is time to connect to the MQTT adapter using the newly created client certificate and publish some data.
First, we start a consumer for the tenant that we registered the device for. You can download the client from the
Hono web site
:
$ java -jar hono-cli-*-exec.jar --hono.client.host=hono.eclipse.org --hono.client.port=15671 --hono.client.tlsEnabled=true --hono.client.username=consumer@HONO --hono.client.password=verysecret --spring.profiles.active=receiver --tenant.id=$TENANT
In the final step, we use the
Eclipse Mosquitto
command line client to publish some telemetry data:
$ mosquitto_pub -h hono.eclipse.org -p 8883 --capath /etc/ssl/certs/ --cert device-cert.pem --key device-key.pem -q 1 -t telemetry -m "Hello there"
If all goes well you should be able to see the data being logged to the console in the terminal where you have started the consumer.
The device may also use HTTP to publish data:
$ curl -i --cert device-cert.pem --key device-key.pem -H 'Content-Type: plain/text' -H 'Expect:' --data-binary 'Hello there' https://hono.eclipse.org:8443/telemetry

Description

When a message arrived, the
message limit
checks failed to calculate the payload size of the incoming message based on the configured
minimum message size
. Instead, it used the actual payload size to verify if the
message limit
has been exceeded or not. This has been fixed now.
The Command & Control implementation in the protocol adapters has been optimized to use far fewer consumer links to the AMQP Messaging Network, saving up on resources. Before this change, the protocol adapters created a separate receiver link for each device that wanted to receive commands. Now each protocol adapter instance creates only a single receiver link over which all commands for all devices connected to the adapter instance are transmitted.
The base classes for implementing a device registry have been moved into their own
device-registry-based
module.
The example device registry’s AMQP and HTTP endpoints do no longer exchange incoming request messages and outgoing response messages with the service implementation verticles over the Vert.x EventBus. This reduces complexity and should improve throughput as messages no longer need to be serialized anymore.
A first version of the CoAP User Guide has been added.
A concept page explaining the different ways devices can be connected to Hono’s protocol adapters has been added. There is also example code illustrating how a protocol gateway which connects to the AMQP adapter can be implemented.
API Changes
The device registry credentials endpoint will no longer hand out sensitive details for hashed-password secrets.

Business Application
to have multiple competing consumers for telemetry data for a given tenant to share the load of processing the messages.
Preconditions
Client has established an AMQP connection with Hono.
Client has established an AMQP link in role
receiver
with Hono using source address
where
represents the ID of the tenant the client wants to retrieve telemetry data for.
Hono supports both
AT MOST ONCE
as well as
AT LEAST ONCE
delivery of telemetry messages. However, clients SHOULD use
AT LEAST ONCE
delivery in order to support end-to-end flow control and therefore SHOULD set the

) or
unsettled
(
AT LEAST ONCE
)
Authentication: SASL PLAIN or SASL EXTERNAL
Message Body:
(optional) Arbitrary payload
Message properties:
(optional) Arbitrary properties (content-type, correlation-id, …)
Disposition Frames:
Accepted: Message successfully processed by the adapter.
Released: Message cannot be processed and should be redelivered.
Rejected: Adapter rejects the message due to one of the following:
(
hono:bad-request
): Request rejected due to a bad client request.
no
KEY_CONNECTION_CHECK
The key used to check the health of the cache.
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_COMMON_CHECKVALUE
--hono.deviceConnection.common.checkValue
no
VALUE_CONNECTION_CHECK
The value used to check the health of the cache.
The type of the cache is selected on startup by enabling or disabling the profile
embedded-cache
. If the profile is enabled the embedded cache is used, otherwise the remote cache is being used. The remote cache is the default.
Remote cache
The following table provides an overview of the configuration variables and corresponding command line options for configuring the connection to the data grid:
Environment Variable
Command Line Option
Mandatory
Default
Description
MUST contain the correlation ID used to match the command message with the response message containing the result of execution on the device.
device_id
yes
application-properties
string
The identifier of the device that sent the response.
status
yes
application-properties
integer
MUST indicate the status of the execution. See table below for possible values.
tenant_id
yes
application-properties
string
The identifier of the tenant that the device belongs to.
The
status
SigFox
or
LoRa
. In this case the credentials provided by the gateway during connection establishment with the protocol adapter are used to authenticate the gateway whereas the parameters from the topic name are used to identify the device that the gateway publishes data for.
The protocol adapter checks the gateway’s authority to publish data on behalf of the device implicitly by means of retrieving a
registration assertion
for the device from the
configured Device Registration service
.
Examples
Publish some JSON data for device

The example above assumes that a gateway device with ID

Request Body:
(optional) Arbitrary payload encoded according to the given content type. Maybe empty, if
URI-query: empty
is provided.
Response Options:
(optional)
content-format
HONO_HTTP_INSECURE_PORT
to a valid port number, or by
implicitly configuring the default port (8080) by simply setting
HONO_HTTP_INSECURE_PORT_ENABLED
to
true
.
The protocol adapter issues a warning on the console if
HONO_HTTP_INSECURE_PORT
is set to the default secure HTTP port (8443).
The
HONO_HTTP_INSECURE_PORT_BIND_ADDRESS
variable can be used to specify the network interface that the port should be exposed on. By default the port is bound to the
loopback device
only, i.e. the port will only be accessible from the local host. This variable might be used to e.g. expose the non-TLS secured port on a local interface only, thus providing easy access from within the local network, while still requiring encrypted communication when accessed from the outside over public network infrastructure.
Setting this variable to
0.0.0.0
will let the port being bound to

Make sure that you are able to connect to the respective protocol adapter with TLS (see the
Admin Guide
for configuration).
Here
is an article, that provides a complete walk-through guide for all required steps.
Additionally you can use and adapt the script for the creation of demo certificates in the Hono repository. More information can be found in the user guide of the protocol adapters (
MQTT
,
HTTP
).

Dejan has posted a message on the mailing list regarding Hono's policy for supported versions. We would be very interested in your opinion on this as we need to establish some rules that put us in a position to provide an appropriate level of support while not wasting our time with fixing outdated and potentially unused versions. So please be so kind and leave your opinion so that we can do this as right. Thanks :-)

frame during link establishment.
A client MAY indicate to Hono during link establishment that it wants to distribute the telemetry messages received for a given tenant among multiple consumers by including a link property
subscription-name
whose value is shared by all other consumers of the tenant. Hono ensures that messages from a given device are delivered to the same consumer. Note that this also means that telemetry messages MAY not be evenly distributed among consumers, e.g. when only a single device sends data.
NB
This feature is not supported yet.
In addition a client MAY include a boolean link property

(
amqp:unauthorized-access
): Request rejected because the adapter is disabled for tenant.
(
amqp:precondition-failed
): Request does not fulfill certain requirements e.g adapter cannot assert device registration etc.

): Request rejected because the message limit for the given tenant is exceeded.
When a device publishes data to the

The protocol adapter may be configured to open both a secure and a non-secure port at the same time simply by configuring both ports as described above. For this to work, both ports must be configured to use different port numbers, otherwise startup will fail.
Ephemeral Ports
Both the secure as well as the insecure port numbers may be explicitly set to
0
. The protocol adapter will then use arbitrary (unused) port numbers determined by the operating system during startup.

mean that the message has been delivered to any potential consumer. However, if the QoS level header is set to

(
at least once
semantics), then the adapter waits for the message to be delivered and accepted by a downstream consumer before responding with this status code.
400 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons for this include:
The content type header is missing.
The request body is empty.
The QoS header value is invalid.
403 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The given tenant is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.
The given device does not belong to the given tenant.
404 (Not Found): The request cannot be processed because the device is disabled or does not exist.
413 (Request Entity Too Large): The request cannot be processed because the request body exceeds the maximum supported size.
429 (Too Many Requests): The request cannot be processed because the tenant’s message limit for the current period is exceeded.
503 (Service Unavailable): The request cannot be processed because there is no consumer of telemetry data for the given tenant connected to Hono.
This resource MUST be used by devices that have not authenticated to the protocol adapter. Note that this requires the

during link establishment in order to indicate to Hono that it does not require messages being delivered strictly in order per device but instead allows for messages being distributed evenly among the consumers.
NB
This feature is not supported yet.
Message Flow
The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of messages involved in a
Business Application
receiving a telemetry data message from Hono. The delivery mode used is
AT LEAST ONCE
.
Receive Telemetry Data
AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network
delivers telemetry message to
Business Application
.
Business Application
acknowledges reception of message.
Note
:
Notice that we only supplied a new value for the message address, leaving the other default values.
Publish some JSON data for device
4711
using a client certificate for authentication:
Publish Telemetry Data (unauthenticated Device)
Message Address:
or
Settlement Mode:
presettled
(AT MOST ONCE) or

(AT LEAST ONCE)
Authentication: none
Message Body:
(optional) Arbitrary payload
Message properties:
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_REMOTE_AUTHREALM
--hono.deviceConnection.remote.authRealm
yes
-
The authentication realm for the SASL handshake when authenticating to the server.
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_REMOTE_AUTHUSERNAME
--hono.deviceConnection.remote.authUsername
yes
-
The username to use for authenticating to the server.
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_REMOTE_AUTHPASSWORD
--hono.deviceConnection.remote.authPassword
yes
-
The password to use for authenticating to the server.
In general, the service supports all configuration properties of the
400 - 599
range) the message body MAY contain a detailed description of the error that occurred.
If a command message response contains a payload, the body of the message MUST consist of a single AMQP
Data
section containing the response message data.
Examples
The following sequence diagram illustrates how a
Business Application
sends a command called
getReading
to device
4711
of the
DEFAULT_TENANT
and receives a response from the device:
Successfully send a Command
The sending of a command may fail for the same reasons as those illustrated for sending a one-way command. Additionally, the sending of a command may be considered unsuccessful by an application if it does not receive the response from the device in a reasonable amount of time:
Command times out
PUBACK
packet to the client once the event has been settled with the
accepted
outcome by the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network.
This requires that
the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network has capacity to process events for the client’s tenant and
the events published by the client comply with the format defined by the Event API.
The protocol adapter checks the configured
message limit
before accepting any event messages. If the message limit is exceeded or the incoming event message cannot be processed, the connection to the client is closed.
The devices can optionally indicate a
time-to-live
duration for event messages by setting the
hono-ttl
property explicitly in the
property-bag
option contains exactly the URI-path that the device must use when sending its response to the command. Note that in both cases the
path segments indicate the device that the command is targeted at. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
Response Body:
(optional) Arbitrary data serving as input to a command to be executed by the device, if status code is 2.05 (Content).
(optional) Error details, if status code is >= 4.00.
Response Codes:
2.04 (Changed): The data in the request body has been accepted for processing. The response may contain a command for a device to execute. Note that if the message type is
NON
(
at most once
semantics), this status code does
not
mean that the message has been delivered to any potential consumer (yet). However, if the message type is
CON
(
at least once
semantics), then the adapter waits for the message to be delivered and accepted by a downstream consumer before responding with this status code.

Currently the travis build fails as the tests corresponding to search devices with wildcards in the file-based device registry fails. This wildcard search feature is not yet implemented in the file-based registry. I have raised a PR

to implement this feature for the file-based registry and it should also fix the travis build. It would be great if someone could take a look at the PR

The Protocol Gateway approach is the
officially
supported and recommended one. If you are planning to deploy and operate Hono yourself, you can, of course, also implement a Protocol Adapter.
Thanks, I will look into it more.

window.webpackPublicPath = '//cdn02.gitter.im/_s/edbef577a/js/';
The
Business Application
can only consume telemetry messages that have been uploaded to Hono
after
the
Business Application
has established the link with the
AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network
. This is because telemetry messages are not
durable
, i.e. they are not persisted in Hono in order to be forwarded at a later time.
Message Format
The format of the messages containing the telemetry data is the same as for the
Forward Telemetry Data operation
.
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
(optional) Arbitrary properties (content-type, correlation-id, …)
Disposition Frames:
Accepted: Message successfully processed by the adapter.
Released: Message cannot be processed and should be redelivered.
Rejected: Adapter rejects the message due to:
(
hono:bad-request
): A bad client request (e.g invalid content-type).
(
amqp:unauthorized-access
): The adapter is disabled for tenant.
(
amqp:precondition-failed
): Request not fulfilling certain requirements.
(
amqp:resource-limit-exceeded
): Request rejected because the message limit for the given tenant is exceeded.
Note how verbose the address is for unauthenticated devices. This address can be used by devices that have not authenticated to the protocol adapter. This requires the
Infinispan Hotrod client
using
hono.deviceConnection.remote
instead of the
infinispan.client.hotrod
prefix.
Embedded cache
The following table provides an overview of the configuration variables and corresponding command line options for configuring the embedded cache:
hono.device-connection.embedded.configuration-file
Environment Variable
Command Line Option
Mandatory
Default
Description
HONO_DEVICECONNECTION_EMBEDDED_CONFIGURATIONFILE
--hono.deviceConnection.embedded.configurationFile
yes
-
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
. The
property-bag
is an optional collection of properties intended for the receiver of the message. A property bag is only allowed at the very end of a topic. It always starts with a
/?
character, followed by pairs of URL encoded property names and values that are separated by
&
. For example, a property bag containing two properties
seqNo
and
importance
looks like this:
/topic/name/?seqNo=10034&importance=high
.
The MQTT adapter currently does not use any properties except
hono-ttl
.
Publish an Event (authenticated Device)
4.00 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons include:
the request body is empty and the
URI-query
option doesn’t contain the
empty
parameter
4.03 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The tenant that the gateway belongs to is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.
The device belongs to another tenant than the gateway.
The gateway is not authorized to act
on behalf of
the device.
The gateway associated with the device is not registered or disabled.
4.04 (Not Found): The request cannot be processed because the device is disabled or does not exist.
4.13 (Request Entity Too Large): The request cannot be processed because the request body exceeds the maximum supported size.
4.29 (Too Many Requests): The request cannot be processed because the tenant’s message limit for the current period is exceeded.
5.03 (Service Unavailable): The request cannot be processed because there is no consumer of telemetry data for the given tenant connected to Hono.

The device registry may choose to not return information which is not suitable for authentication a device. This includes for example the enabled property. If set to false, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.

The
FireFly
LoRa adapter now supports mapping of the
mic
property.
A bug preventing the lora and SigFox adapters to start up correctly has been fixed.
The MQTT adapter failed to accept command response messages from authenticated gateways that had been published to the
topic. This has been fixed and the adapter now correctly uses the gateway’s tenant in this case.
When a north bound application sent a command to a device that is connected via a gateway, the AMQP adapter set the gateway’s ID instead of the device’s ID in the command response forwarded to the application. This has been fixed.
1.1.0
New Features
The Sigfox and LoRaWAN adapters now report metrics analogously to the other protocol adapters.
With the release of
Eclipse Californium
2.0.0, the CoAP adapter became an official part of the Hono release. The adapter also supports tracking of request processing using OpenTracing but is still considered
experimental
.

The absolute path to the (PKCS8) PEM file containing the private key that the server should use for authenticating to clients. This option must be used in conjunction with
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_CERT_PATH
. Alternatively, the
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_KEY_STORE_PATH
option can be used to configure a key store containing both the key as well as the certificate.
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD
--hono.registry.http.keyStorePassword

URI:
Method:
PUT
Request Headers:
(optional)
authorization
: The gateway’s
auth-id
and plain text password encoded according to the
Basic HTTP authentication scheme
. If not set, the adapter expects the gateway to present a client certificate as part of the TLS handshake during connection establishment.
(required)
content-type
: The type of payload contained in the request body.
(optional)
hono-ttd
HONO_AMQP_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
configuration property to be explicitly set to
false
before starting the protocol adapter.
Examples
Publish some JSON data for device
4711
:
Publish Telemetry Data (authenticated Gateway)
A device that publishes data on behalf of another device is called a gateway device. The message address is used by
gateway
components to publish data
on behalf of
The absolute path to an Infinispan configuration file. Also see the
Infinispan Configuration Schema
.
Authentication Service Connection Configuration
The Device Connection component requires a connection to an implementation of Hono’s Authentication API in order to authenticate and authorize client requests.
The connection is configured according to
Hono Client Configuration
where the
is set to
HONO_AUTH
. Since Hono’s Authentication Service does not allow caching of the responses, the cache properties can be ignored.
In addition to the standard client configuration properties, following properties need to be set for the connection:
Topic:
event
or
e
Authentication: required
Payload:
(required) Arbitrary payload
This is the preferred way for devices to publish events. It is available only if the protocol adapter has been configured to require devices to authenticate (which is the default).
Example
Upload a JSON string for device
4711
:
Upload a JSON string for device
4711
with
time-to-live
as 10 seconds:
Publish an Event (unauthenticated Device)
This resource can be used by
gateway
components to publish data
on behalf of
other devices which do not connect to a protocol adapter directly but instead are connected to the gateway, e.g. using some low-bandwidth radio based technology like
SigFox
or
LoRa
. In this case the credentials provided by the gateway during connection establishment with the protocol adapter are used to authenticate the gateway whereas the parameters from the URI are used to identify the device that the gateway publishes data for.
The protocol adapter checks the gateway’s authority to publish data on behalf of the device implicitly by means of retrieving a
registration assertion
for the device from the
configured Device Registration service
.
Examples
Publish some JSON data for device

For the test case
JdbcBasedCredentialsServiceTest.testUpdateCredentialsSupportsUpdatingExistingSecrets
… the management side reports back two entries … which is correct … for the adapter side, it reports back only one, which is correct as well, because the other entry is still invalid for the adapter, and the adapter API doesn't hand out invalid entries
Jens Reimann
@ctron
From the Hono docs:
The device registry may choose to not return information which is not suitable for authentication a device. This includes for example the enabled property. If set to false, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.

network provider.
Hono’s protocol adapters now support Server Name Indication in order to allow devices to establish a TLS connection with adapters using a tenant specific server certificate and host name. Please refer to the
Secure Communication
admin guide for details.
Hono now supports
auto-provisioning
of devices that authenticate with X.509 client certificates. For more information please refer to the
Device Provisioning
concept and for details to the
Tenant API
and the
Credentials API
.
The Hono Auth Server and Device Registry components now support configuring the SASL mechanisms advertised to a client connecting to these components. This can be used to restrict the support to only one of the SASL PLAIN and EXTERNAL mechanisms instead of both.
A new metric namely
hono.connections.authenticated.duration
has been introduced to track the connection duration of the authenticated devices. Please refer to the
The absolute path to the Java key store containing the private key and certificate that the server should use for authenticating to clients. Either this option or the
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_KEY_PATH
and
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_CERT_PATH
options need to be set in order to enable TLS secured connections with clients. The key store format can be either
JKS

PKCS12
indicated by a

: The QoS level for publishing telemetry messages. The adapter supports
at most once
(
0

at least once
(
1
) QoS levels. The default value of
0

Response Headers:
(optional)
other devices which do not connect to a protocol adapter directly but instead are connected to the gateway, e.g. using some low-bandwidth radio based technology like
SigFox
or
LoRa
. In this case the credentials provided by the gateway during connection establishment with the protocol adapter are used to authenticate the gateway whereas the message address is used to identify the device that the gateway publishes data for.
Examples
A gateway connecting to the adapter using
gw@DEFAULT_TENANT
as username and
gw-secret
as password and then publishing some JSON data for device
4711
:
In this example, we are using message address
t/DEFAULT_TENANT/4711

-
The absolute path to the PEM file containing the public key that the service should use for validating tokens issued by the Authentication service. Alternatively, a symmetric key can be used for validating tokens by setting the
HONO_AUTH_VALIDATION_SHARED_SECRET
variable. If none of these variables is set, the service falls back to the key indicated by the
HONO_AUTH_CERT_PATH
variable. If that variable is also not set, startup of the service fails.

The protocol adapters that maintain
connection state
can now be configured to verify the
connection duration limit
for each tenant before accepting any new connection request from the devices. Please refer to the
resource-limits
section for more details.
Hono’s example device registry now supports configuring a time out for processing requests from clients. This is configured using the property
sendTimeOutInMs
in
org.eclipse.hono.config.ServiceConfigProperties
.
Hono’s Helm chart is now available from the
Eclipse IoT Packages chart repository
. All future development of the chart will be done in the IoT Packages project only. The deployment guide has been adapted accordingly.

The number of credits to flow to a client connecting to the Device Registration endpoint.
Hono’s Helm chart now supports configuring resource requests and limits of the container images.
The MQTT adapter now includes a device’s MQTT client ID in its request to retrieve the device’s credentials. This additional information can be used by device registry implementations when determining the device identity.
The domain name of the
Hono Sandbox
has been changed to
hono.eclipseprojects.io
. It will still be available at the old domain name for some time as well, though.
Hono’s OpenTracing instrumentation has been upgraded to Opentracing 0.33.0. The example deployment now uses the Jaeger Java client in version 0.35.2 and the Jaeger 1.16 agent and back end components.
Some of the environment variable names documented in the user guides which can be used for configuring Hono components had not been recognized during start up of the components. In particular, the names for configuring the connection to the Device Connection service and for configuring a heath check server have been fixed.
The AMQP adapter now correctly accepts command response messages from devices that do not contain any payload. Such responses are useful to only convey a status code in reply to a command.

We would be very interested in your opinion on this as we need to establish some rules that put us in a position to provide an appropriate level of support while not wasting our time with fixing outdated and potentially unused versions. So please be so kind and leave your opinion so that we can do this as right. Thanks :-)

Currently the travis build fails as the tests corresponding to search devices with wildcards in the file-based device registry fails. This wildcard search feature is not yet implemented in the file-based registry. I have raised a PR
#2229
to implement this feature for the file-based registry and it should also fix the travis build. It would be great if someone could take a look at the PR

Multi-Tenancy
Hono is designed to structure the set of all internally managed data and data streams into strictly isolated subsets. This includes the registration data and credentials of devices, internal users that are used for authentication, and the
Business Applications
that are part of such subsets as well.
This way of
strict
isolation is generally known as multi-tenancy, where a
tenant
is the term for such a subset. Such an isolation is essential for enabling a scalable distributed architecture to handle independent subsets as if each subset had its own installation (which would be much harder to maintain and would not benefit from runtime cost sharing).

Device Identity
This page describes how devices are represented and identified throughout Hono and its APIs.
The main purpose of Hono is to provide a uniform API for applications to interact with devices, regardless of the particular communication protocol the devices natively use. In order to do so, Hono uses a unique
logical
identifier to refer to each device individually.
Hono does not make any assumptions about the format of a device identifier (or
device-id
for short). It basically is a string which is defined at the time a device is being
provisioned
. Once created, the device can be referred to by this identifier when using Hono’s APIs until the device is being removed from the system.

Hono Client Configuration
The
org.eclipse.hono.client.HonoConnection
factory can be used to create AMQP 1.0 connections to Hono’s service components.
The factory uses environment variables and/or command line options to configure the connection to the service and the caching of responses to service invocations. All variables used for configuring the connection factory for a particular service share a common
prefix
. This way, multiple sets of variables can be used to configure multiple factories for connecting to different service endpoints without interfering with each other. For example, the set of variables for configuring the connection factory for the Device Registration service may use the common prefix
HONO_REGISTRATION
whereas the set for configuring the factory for the Credentials service may use
HONO_CREDENTIALS
.
Connection Properties
The following table provides an overview of the configuration variables and corresponding command line options for configuring the AMQP connection to the service. Note that the variables map to the properties of classes
org.eclipse.hono.config.ClientConfigProperties
and
org.eclipse.client.RequestResponseClientConfigProperties

Command & Control
The MQTT adapter enables devices to receive commands that have been sent by business applications by means of sending an MQTT
SUBSCRIBE
packet containing a device specific
topic filter
as described below. Devices can subscribe with QoS 1 or QoS 0. The adapter indicates the outcome of the subscription request by sending back a corresponding
SUBACK
packet. The SUBACK packet will contain
Success - QoS 0
(
0x00
) or
Success - QoS 1
(
content-format
: A media type describing the semantics and format of payload contained in the response body. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device which requires input data. Note that this option will be empty if the media type contained in the command (AMQP) message’s
content-type
property cannot be mapped to one of the registered CoAP
content-format
codes.
(optional)
location-query
: The

Hono’s multi-tenancy concept is based on handling tenants as own
entities
In the following the different aspects of multi-tenancy in Hono are addressed and a full overview of the concept is given.
The Tenant API
By means of the
Tenant API
Hono handles tenants as own
entities
. The API defines how to
retrieve
the details of a specific tenant. This offers the possibility to handle arbitrary properties on the level of a tenant (see e.g.
Protocol adapter configuration
). For convenience, there are CRUD operations for the handling of tenants, which can be found in the
Device Registry Management API
.
Protocol Adapters respect the Tenant API
When a device connects to one of Hono’s protocol adapters, the adapter determines the tenant this device belongs to. How this is done is described in the User Guide. After the tenant is determined, the adapter retrieves the details of the determined tenant by means of the Tenant API. Only if the tenant exists and is enabled the adapter further processes the data of the device that is connecting. Otherwise the connection will be closed.
. Each tenant has a unique identifier, a string called the
tenant-id
, and can be used to provide a logical grouping of devices belonging e.g. to the same application scope or organizational unit. Each device can thus be uniquely identified by the tuple (
tenant-id
,
device-id
). This tuple is broadly used throughout Hono’s APIs when addressing a particular device.
Device Registration
Hono components use the
Device Registration API
to access device registration information. The API defines the
assert Registration
operation for verifying a device’s registration status. In many real world scenarios there will already be a component in place which keeps track of devices and which supports the particular
provisioning process
being used to bring devices into life. In such cases it makes sense to simply implement the Device Registration API as a
facade
on top of the existing component.

100
The number of credits to flow to a client connecting to the Tenant endpoint.
The variables only need to be set if the default value does not match your environment.
Port Configuration
The Device Registry supports configuration of both, an AMQP based endpoint as well as an HTTP based endpoint proving RESTful resources for managing registration information and credentials. Both endpoints can be configured to listen for connections on
a secure port only (default) or
an insecure port only or
both a secure and an insecure port (dual port configuration)
See
Port Configuration
for more information.
Note
The environment variables to use for configuring the REST endpoint are the same as the ones for the AMQP endpoint, substituting
_AMQP_
with
interface’s
get
get
method has been removed.
1.0.3
Fixes & Enhancements
Hono’s Helm Chart now correctly configures Prometheus based resource limit checks if a Prometheus server is being used for collecting metrics.
Some OpenTracing spans used for tracking processing of messages haven’t properly been finished. This has been fixed.
Protocol adapters are now able to process messages while still trying to re-establish connections to other services after a connection loss. This might result in fewer messages being rejected in such situations.
1.0.2
Fixes & Enhancements
The example deployment now also works with Kubernetes 1.16 using Helm 2.15 and later.
The Hono chart can now also be deployed using the recently released Helm 3. In fact, Helm 3 is now the recommended way for deploying Hono as it doesn’t require installation of any Helm specific components to the Kubernetes cluster.
The example data grid which can be deployed using the Hono Helm chart can now be scaled out to more than one node.
Under rare circumstances an HTTP adapter instance might have gotten into a state where a device’s requests to receive commands could no longer be processed successfully anymore until the adapter instance had been restarted. This has been fixed.
A potential issue has been identified where some command messages might not get sent to the corresponding gateway. The scenario here involves the gateway sending event/telemetry messages via HTTP with a
no
-
The insecure port the server should listen on for HTTP requests.
See
Port Configuration
below for details.
Deprecated
Use
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_INSECURE_PORT
instead.
HONO_REGISTRY_REST_INSECURE_PORT_BIND_ADDRESS
--hono.registry.rest.insecurePortBindAddress
no
127.0.0.1
The IP address of the network interface that the insecure HTTP port should be bound to.
See
Port Configuration
. In this case the credentials provided by the gateway during connection establishment with the protocol adapter are used to authenticate the gateway whereas the parameters from the URI are used to identify the device that the gateway publishes data for.
The protocol adapter checks the gateway’s authority to publish data on behalf of the device implicitly by means of retrieving a
registration assertion
for the device from the
configured Device Registration service
.
Examples
Publish some JSON data for device
4712
:
Publish some JSON data for device
4712

Message properties:
(optional) Arbitrary properties (content-type, correlation-id, …)
Disposition Frames:
Accepted: Message successfully processed by the adapter.
Released: Message cannot be processed and should be redelivered.
Rejected: Adapter rejects the message due to:

): A bad client request (e.g invalid content-type).
(
amqp:unauthorized-access
): The adapter is disabled for tenant.
(
0x01
) for a command topic filter indicating QoS 0 or 1 and will contain the
Failure
(
0x80
) value for all other filters. When a device no longer wants to receive commands anymore, it can send an MQTT
UNSUBSCRIBE
packet to the adapter, including the same topic filter that has been used to subscribe.
When a device has successfully subscribed, the adapter sends an
empty notification
on behalf of the device to the downstream AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network with the
ttd
header set to
-1
, indicating that the device will be ready to receive commands until further notice. Analogously, the adapter sends an empty notification with the
ttd
header set to
for commands expecting a response. In the latter case, the
location-path
option contains exactly the URI-path that the device must use when sending its response to the command. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
Response Body:
(optional) Arbitrary data serving as input to a command to be executed by the device, if status code is 2.05 (Content).
(optional) Error details, if status code is >= 4.00.

From the Hono docs:
Protocol Adapter Configuration
Example
: a tenant that
can use the MQTT protocol adapter
but is not allowed to use the HTTP protocol adapter
Please refer to the
Tenant API
to find out which protocol adapter properties can be configured at the tenant level.
AMQP 1.0 Endpoints
The AMQP 1.0 endpoints for all APIs of Hono are scoped to a tenant, by using the scheme
<api-name>/TENANT/...
.
Examples
:
telemetry/TENANT
event/TENANT
registration/TENANT
In addition to that, Hono defines a
Device Registry Management API
, which can be implemented to take advantage of standardized operations for managing devices and credentials. This API is optional because Hono components do not require it during runtime.
Hono comes with a
MongoDB
and a
simple file
based implementations of both APIs. The file based implementation, which keeps all data in memory, is to be used only for demonstration purposes and is not supposed to be used in production scenarios.
Device Authentication
Devices connect to protocol adapters in order to publish telemetry data or events. Downstream applications consuming this data often take particular actions based on the content of the messages. Such actions may include simply updating some statistics, e.g. tracking the average room temperature, but may also trigger more serious activities like shutting down a power plant. It is therefore important that applications can rely on the fact that the messages they process have in fact been produced by the device indicated by a message’s source address.
Hono relies on protocol adapters to establish a device’s identity before it is allowed to publish downstream data or receive commands. Conceptually, Hono distinguishes between two identities
an identity associated with the authentication credentials (termed the
authentication identity
or
auth-id
), and
an identity to act as (the

The idea was to separate the Device class into two: one with a status property and one without (this emerged from a discussion with
@kaniyan
and personally I think this simplifies a lot of things and I do like the idea
😃
).
Because of that separation it is easier to make sure that a user is actually not able to change the status (which is in fact system internal as far as I understood)
In order to make as much logic as possible generic I also refactored the Device and the MongoDb based registry so that they both use DTOs and introduced a new BaseDTO class. By this we can separate internal and user-editable state. Also, I hope this fits the JDBC based registry (given I understood the code in the current PRs correctly): it is still a JSON based object as the Device class itself.
The generic wildcard in DeviceManagementService / AbstractDeviceManagementService was intended to allow merging this first without having to implement this in the JDBC registry (or in general: to allow implementations without a status property...)
The BaseDTO should also allow for adding corresponding TenantWithStatus and CredentialsWithStatus implementations. Since status implementations will differ (at least we need the two status properties
auto-provisioned

Commands can be sent following a
request/response
pattern or being
one-way
.
For
Request/Response
commands, devices send their responses to commands by means of sending an MQTT
PUBLISH
message to a topic that is specific to the command that has been executed. The MQTT adapter accepts responses being published using either QoS 0 or QoS 1.
The MQTT adapter checks the configured
message limit
before accepting any command requests and responses. In case of incoming command requests from business applications, if the message limit is exceeded, the Adapter rejects the message with the reason
amqp:resource-limit-exceeded
. And for the incoming command responses from devices, the Adapter rejects the message and closes the connection to the client.

4.00 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons include:
the request body is empty and the
URI-query
option doesn’t contain the
empty
parameter
4.03 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The given tenant is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.
4.04 (Not Found): The request cannot be processed because the device is disabled or does not exist.
4.13 (Request Entity Too Large): The request cannot be processed because the request body exceeds the maximum supported size.
4.29 (Too Many Requests): The request cannot be processed because the tenant’s message limit for the current period is exceeded.
5.03 (Service Unavailable): The request cannot be processed because there is no consumer of telemetry data for the given tenant connected to Hono.
This is the preferred way for devices to publish events. It is available only if the protocol adapter is configured to require devices to authenticate (which is the default).

This separates the AMQP endpoints from each other on a tenant level.
The only exception to this is the
Tenant API
which does not follow this scheme since it is addressing the tenants themselves.
Devices and Tenants
A physical device will usually be represented in Hono as an entity in the device registry, having a unique identity and belonging to exactly one tenant. All data sent from a device, as well as from the application to the device, is therefore treated as belonging to the corresponding tenant.
The following diagram shows the relation between tenants, devices and their credentials:
Tenants, Devices and Credentials
Tenant based Flow Control
An important detail in Hono’s architecture is that data sent downstream is transported via the tenant scoped AMQP 1.0 links from the protocol adapters to the AMQP 1.0 network. Each tenant has its own pair of AMQP 1.0 links and is treated independently from other tenants regarding the back pressure mechanism that AMQP 1.0 offers. This enables a
Business application
to limit the rate at which it consumes AMQP 1.0 messages per tenant.
For the other direction, when commands are sent from the application to the device, the rate is also limited per tenant.
Authorization at Tenant Level
Hono’s components authenticate each other by means of the
device identity
or
device-id
).
A device therefore presents an
auth-id
as part of its credentials during the authentication process which is then resolved to a
device identity
by the protocol adapter on successful verification of the credentials.
In order to support the protocol adapters in the process of verifying credentials presented by a device, the
Credentials API
provides means to look up
secrets
on record for the device and use this information to verify the credentials.
The Credentials API supports registration of multiple sets of credentials for each device. A set of credentials consists of an
auth-id
and some sort of
secret
Deploying custom Container Images
The chart by default installs Hono’s pre-built container images. In some cases it might be desirable to build Hono from source, e.g. in order to use a different metrics back end or to
use Jaeger tracing
.
The container images created as part of the build process need to be made available to the Kubernetes cluster that Hono should be installed to. This usually requires the images to be pushed to a (private) container registry that the cluster can pull them from. Please refer to the documentation of the employed Kubernetes service provider for details regarding the setup and configuration of a private container registry.
Deploying via a private Registry
The first step is getting the source code of Hono. Please refer to
Building from Source
for details. Once the source code has been retrieved, the build process can be started using the following command:
After the build process has finished, the custom container images need to be pushed to the registry so that the Kubernetes cluster can pull them from there during deployment. Assuming that the images should be tagged with
1.0.3-CUSTOM
and the container registry name is
my.registry.io
, the following command can be used to tag the locally built images and push them to the registry:
Note
You may need to log in to the (private) container registry before pushing the images.
The image names that Hono should use for starting up containers can be configured in a YAML file:
no
5000
The maximum amount of time (milliseconds) that the client should wait for the AMQP connection to be opened. This includes the time for TCP/TLS connection establishment, SASL handshake and exchange of the AMQP
open
frame. This property can be used to tune the time period to wait according to the network latency involved with the connection between the client and the service.
no
-
The absolute path to a properties file that contains a
username
and a

property to use for authenticating to the service.
This variable is an alternative to using
and
which has the advantage of not needing to expose the secret (password) in the client process’ environment.

device that has last sent a telemetry or event message via this gateway.
1.0.1
Fixes & Enhancements
The AMQP protocol adapter now requests devices to send traffic periodically in order to prevent a time out of the connection. This way the adapter is able to detect and close stale connections which is important to reliably close the device’s corresponding command consumer. The time period after which the adapter should consider a connection stale can be configured using an environment variable. Please refer to the AMQP adapter’s admin guide for details.
The example deployment using the Helm chart correctly creates the
DEFAULT_TENANT
again.
1.0.0
New Features
A tenant can now be configured with a
max-ttl
which is used as a upper boundary for default TTL values configured for devices/tenants. Please refer to the
Tenant API
for details. The AMQP, HTTP, MQTT and Kura protocol adapters consider this property when setting a TTL on downstream event messages.
A protocol adapter can now be configured with a timeout for idle tenants. When there has been no communication between a protocol adapter instance and the devices of a tenant, the former one releases allocated resources of the tenant. Currently this means that it closes AMQP links and stops reporting metrics for this tenant. The timeout is configured with the property

Port Configuration

i think it should … however, I think it makes more sense to add some kind of method
deviceRegistryOnlyReturnsValidEntries() -> bool
and take the value of that to test for either 1 or 2 expected entries
Authentication API
Example
: a tenant (defined by means of authorization configuration) that
is allowed to send telemetry data downstream
but is not allowed to send event data
This is done by not including the event endpoint in the authorization token for these tenants.
Business Applications and Tenants
The northbound
Business applications
are always connecting to the AMQP 1.0 endpoints of Hono. By means of the authentication and authorization setup and the fact that the endpoints are scoped to a tenant, the
Business application
is only acting in the context of one tenant.
Separation of Tenants
Tenants are separated from each other in all of Hono’s components. Here is a summary of how this is implemented:
the registration of devices are strictly scoped to a tenant
the credentials of devices are strictly scoped to a tenant
information. The particular
type
of secret determines the kind of information kept. Please refer to the
Standard Credential Types
defined in the Credentials API for details. Based on this approach, a device may be authenticated using different types of secrets, e.g. a
hashed password
or a
pre-shared key
, depending on the capabilities of the device and/or protocol adapter.
Once the protocol adapter has resolved the
device-id
for a device, it uses this identity when referring to the device in all subsequent API invocations, e.g. when forwarding telemetry messages downstream to the AMQP Messaging Network.
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
Assuming that the YAML file is called
imageNames.yaml
, installation can then be done using:
Deploying to Minikube
When using Minikube as the deployment target, things are a little easier. Minikube comes with an embedded Docker daemon which can be used to build the container images instead of using a local Docker daemon, thus eliminating the need to push the images to a registry altogether. In order to use Minikube’s Docker daemon, the following command needs to be run:
This will set the Docker environment variables to point to Minikube’s Docker daemon which can then be used for building the container images and storing them locally in the Minikube VM.
In any case the build process can be started using the following command:
The newly built images can then be deployed using Helm:

If set to false, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.

for a protocol adapter. Please refer to the protocol adapter
configuration guides
for details.
The accounting period for the
message limit
checks can now be configured as
monthly
. In this case the data usage for a tenant is calculated from the beginning till the end of the (Gregorian) calendar month. Refer
resource limits
for more information.
The devices can now indicate a
time-to-live
duration for event messages published using the HTTP and MQTT adapters by setting the
hono-ttl
property in requests explicitly. Please refer to the
HTTP Adapter
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_KEY_PATH
instead.
HONO_REGISTRY_REST_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD
--hono.registry.rest.keyStorePassword
no
-
The password required to read the contents of the key store.
Deprecated
Use
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD
instead.
HONO_REGISTRY_REST_KEY_STORE_PATH
--hono.registry.rest.keyStorePath
no
-
The absolute path to the Java key store containing the private key and certificate that the server should use for authenticating to clients. Either this option or the
HONO_REGISTRY_REST_KEY_PATH
hono-ttd
: The number of seconds the device will wait for the response.
(optional)
hono-ttl
: The
time-to-live
in number of seconds for event messages.
Request Body:
(required) Arbitrary payload encoded according to the given content type.
Response Headers:
(optional)
content-type
: A media type describing the semantics and format of payload contained in the response body. This header will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device which requires input data.
(optional)
hono-command
: The name of the command to execute. This header will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
(optional)
header set to
-1
, indicating that the device will be ready to receive commands until further notice. Analogously, the adapter sends an empty notification with the
ttd
header set to
0
when a device closes the link or disconnects.
Devices send their responses to commands by means of sending an AMQP message with properties specific to the command that has been executed. The AMQP adapter accepts responses being published using either
at most once
(QoS 0) or
at least once
(QoS 1) delivery semantics. The device must send the command response messages using the same (sender) link that it uses for sending telemetry data and events.
The AMQP adapter checks the configured
message limit
before accepting any command requests and responses. In case of incoming command requests from business applications or the command responses from devices, if the message limit is exceeded, the Adapter rejects the message with the reason
amqp:resource-limit-exceeded
.
Receiving Commands
Request/Response
commands) : The unique identifier of the command execution request. The identifier is passed to the device as part of the name of the topic that the command is published to. The device needs to publish its response to the command to a topic which includes this identifier, thus allowing the adapter to correlate the response with the request.
: The HTTP status code indicating the outcome of executing the command. This status code is passed on to the application in the AMQP message’s
status
application property.
Receiving Commands (authenticated Device)
An authenticated device MUST use the topic filter
command///req/#
to subscribe to commands.
Deprecation
Previous versions of Hono required authenticated devices to use
command/+/+/req/#
for subscribing to commands. This old topic filter is deprecated. Devices MAY still use it until support for it will be removed in a future Hono version.
Example
The adapter will then publish
Request/Response
commands for the device to topic
, indicating that the device will wait for 10 seconds to receive the response:
Note
In the example above the response actually contains payload that should be used as input to a command to be executed by the device. This is just for illustrative purposes. You will usually get an empty response because there is no downstream application attached which could send any commands to the device.
Publish an Event (unauthenticated Device)
URI:
Method:
PUT
Type:
CON
Request Options:
(optional)
content-format
: The type of payload contained in the request body. Required, if request contains payload.
Query Parameters:

Hints for Production
To be flexible for the different needs of production setups, Hono tries to make as few assumptions about the combination of the different APIs as possible. This means e.g. that the Device Registry does not enforce referential integrity of the APIs:
devices can be created for a tenant that is not existing (yet)
credentials can be created for a tenant and/or a device that is not existing (yet)
tenants can be deleted and leave their scoped devices and credentials still in the configuration (which may not be usable anymore, since the tenant is missing)
These are points that production setups may want to implement differently.
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
jaeger
Maven profile. Please refer to
Monitoring & Tracing
for details. The newly built images also need to be made available to the target Kubernetes cluster as described in the two previous sections.
The chart can be configured to deploy and use an example Jaeger back end by means of setting the
jaegerBackendExample.enabled
property to
true
when running Helm:
This will create a Jaeger back end instance suitable for testing purposes and will configure all deployed Hono components to use the Jaeger back end.
The following command can then be used to return the IP address with which the Jaeger UI can be accessed in a browser (ensure
minikube tunnel
is running when using minikube):
If no example Jaeger back end should be deployed but instead an existing Jaeger installation should be used, the chart’s
jaegerAgentConf
property can be set to environment variables which are passed in to the Jaeger Agent that is deployed with each of Hono’s components.

MQTT Adapter
for details.
The device registry HTTP management API now properly implements
cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
support, by allowing the service to be exposed to configured domains (by default, it’s exposed to all domains).
The
org.eclipse.hono.util.MessageHelper
now provides convenience factory methods for creating new downstream messages from basic properties.
org.eclipse.hono.service.AbstractProtocolAdapterBase
has been adapted to delegate to these new factory methods.
Hono’s protocol adapters can now use multiple trusted certificate authorities per tenant to authenticate devices based on client certificates. The list of trusted certificate authorities can be managed at the tenant level using the Device Registry Management API.
Authenticated gateway devices can now subscribe to commands for specific devices. Before, gateways could only subscribe to commands directed at any of the devices that the gateway has acted on behalf of. With the new feature of also being able to subscribe to commands for specific devices, northbound applications will get notified of such a subscription along with the specific device id.
Now a
max-ttd
value, which is used as an upper boundary for the
hono-ttd
value specified by the devices, can be set as an
and
HONO_REGISTRY_REST_CERT_PATH
options need to be set in order to enable TLS secured connections with clients. The key store format can be either
JKS
or
PKCS12
indicated by a
.jks
or
.p12
file suffix respectively.
Deprecated
Use
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_KEY_STORE_PATH
instead.
HONO_REGISTRY_REST_PORT
--hono.registry.rest.port
no
hono-cmd-req-id
: An identifier that the device must include in its response to a command. This header will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
(optional)
hono-cmd-target-device
: The id of the device that shall execute the command. This header will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device and if the response goes to a gateway that acts on behalf of the target device.
Response Body:
(optional) Arbitrary data serving as input to a command to be executed by the device, if status code is 200.
(optional) Error details, if status code is >= 400.
Status Codes:
200 (OK): The event has been accepted for processing. The response contains a command for the device to execute.
202 (Accepted): The event has been accepted for processing.
400 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons for this include:
The content type header is missing.
The request body is empty but the event is not of type
empty-notification
.
A device MUST use the following source address in its
attach
frame to open a link for receiving commands:
command
(authenticated device)
command
(authenticated gateway receiving commands for all devices it acts on behalf of)
(unauthenticated device)
(authenticated gateway receiving commands for a specific device it acts on behalf of)
The adapter supports
AT LEAST ONCE
delivery of command messages only. A client therefore MUST use
unsettled
for the
snd-settle-mode
and
first
and
one-way
commands to topic
.
For example, a request/response command with name
setBrightness
from an application might look like this:
A corresponding
one-way
command might look like this:
Note that the topic in the latter case doesn’t contain a request identifier.
Receiving Commands (unauthenticated Device)
An unauthenticated device MUST use the topic filter
to subscribe to commands.
Example
The adapter will then publish
Request/Response
empty
: Marks the request as an
empty notification
.
Request Body:
(optional) Arbitrary payload encoded according to the given content type. Maybe empty, if
URI-query: empty
is provided.
Response Options:
(optional)
content-format
: A media type describing the semantics and format of payload contained in the response body. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device which requires input data. Note that this option will be empty if the media type contained in the command (AMQP) message’s
content-type
property cannot be mapped to one of the registered CoAP
content-format
codes.

The topic filters used by MQTT devices to subscribe to commands has been changed slightly to better fit the addressing scheme used by the other protocol adapters. The existing topic filters have been deprecated but are still supported. Please refer to the

401 (Unauthorized): The request cannot be processed because the request does not contain valid credentials.
403 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The given tenant is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.
404 (Not Found): The request cannot be processed because the device is disabled or does not exist.
413 (Request Entity Too Large): The request cannot be processed because the request body exceeds the maximum supported size.
429 (Too Many Requests): The request cannot be processed because the tenant’s message limit for the current period is exceeded.
503 (Service Unavailable): The request cannot be processed because there is no consumer of events for the given tenant connected to Hono.
This is the preferred way for devices to publish events. It is available only if the protocol adapter is configured to require devices to authenticate (which is the default).
Example
Publish some JSON data for device

:
Publish an Event (unauthenticated Device)

Method:
PUT
Request Headers:
(required)
for the
rcv-settle-mode
fields of its

frame during link establishment. All other combinations are not supported and result in the termination of the link.
Once the link has been established, the adapter will send command messages having the following properties:
Name
Mandatory
Location
Type
Description
subject
yes
properties
string
Contains the name of the command to be executed.
reply-to
commands for the device to topic
and
one-way
commands to topic
.
For example, a request/response command with name
setBrightness
from an application might look like this:
A corresponding
one-way
command might look like this:
Note that the topic in the latter case doesn’t contain a request identifier.
Receiving Commands (authenticated Gateway)
Gateway
components can receive commands for devices which do not connect to a protocol adapter directly but instead are connected to the gateway, e.g. using some low-bandwidth radio based technology like
SigFox
or
location-query
: The
hono-command
query parameter contains the name of the command to execute. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
(optional)
location-path
: The location path is
command
for one-way-commands and
command_response/<command-request-id>
for commands expecting a response. In the latter case, the
location-path
option contains exactly the URI-path that the device must use when sending its response to the command. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
Response Body:
(optional) Arbitrary data serving as input to a command to be executed by the device, if status code is 2.05 (Content).
(optional) Error details, if status code is >= 4.00.
Response Codes:
2.04 (Changed): The data in the request body has been accepted for processing. The response may contain a command for the device to execute. Note that if the message type is

and its implementation classes have been moved to package
org.eclipse.hono.service.resourcelimits
from
org.eclipse.hono.service.plan
. Also the configuration parameters for the resource limits were renamed from
hono.plan
to
hono.resourceLimits
. Please refer to the protocol adapter
configuration guides
for more information.
The response payload of the
get Tenant
operation of the Tenant API has been changed to contain a list of trusted certificate authorities instead of just a single one. This way, protocol adapters can now authenticate devices based on client certificates signed by one of multiple different trusted root authorities defined for a tenant. All standard protocol adapters have been adapted to this change. The
Tenant
JSON schema object used in the tenant related resources of the Device Registry Management API has also been adapted to contain a list of trusted authorities instead of a single one.
Deprecations
The OpenShift specific source-to-image deployment model has been removed in favor of the Helm charts and the Eclipse IoT Packages project. You can still deploy Hono on OpenShift using the Helm charts.
device-identities.json
The path to the file where the server stores identities of registered devices. Hono tries to read device identities from this file during start-up and writes out all identities to this file periodically if property

.
Please refer to

for details regarding the file’s format.
HONO_REGISTRY_SVC_MAX_DEVICES_PER_TENANT

. Corresponding devices have to be configured so that they can be used with a gateway. See
Configuring Gateway Devices
for details.
An authenticated gateway MUST use the topic filter
command//+/req/#
to subscribe to commands for all devices in whose behalf it acts.
To subscribe only to commands for a specific device, an authenticated gateway MUST use the topic filter
.
Deprecation
Previous versions of Hono required authenticated gateways to use
command/+/+/req/#
for subscribing to commands. This old topic filter is deprecated. Gateways MAY still use it until support for it will be removed in a future Hono version.
When processing an incoming command message, the protocol adapter will give precedence to a device-specific command subscription matching the command target device, whether the subscription comes from a gateway or the device itself. If there are multiple such subscriptions from multiple gateways and/or from the device itself, the subscription initiated last will get the command messages.
If no device-specific command subscription exists for a command target device, but
one
gateway, that may act on behalf of the device, has subscribed to commands for all its devices, then the command message is sent to that gateway.

semantics), this status code does
not
mean that the message has been delivered to any potential consumer (yet). However, if the message type is
CON
(

4.00 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons include:
the request body is empty and the
URI-query
option doesn’t contain the

4.03 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The given tenant is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.

New Features
The Hono Helm chart now supports to choose if the example Device Registry, example AMQP Messaging Network and/or the example Jaeger back end should be deployed and used with the Hono components or not. In the latter case, the chart now also supports setting configuration properties for using an already existing AMQP Messaging Network, Device Registry and/or Jaeger back end.
A data grid based implementation of the Device Connection API has been added to Hono. This implementation can be used in production environments using a highly scalable data grid for storing device connection information. The service can be used instead of the simple implementation provided by the example Device Registry by means of setting a configuration property when
deploying using the Helm chart
.
A tenant can now be configured so that
all
OpenTracing spans created when processing messages for that specific tenant will be recorded in the tracing backend (overriding the default sampling strategy that might only record a certain percentage of traces). See
Monitoring & Tracing
for more details.

Response Body:
(optional) Arbitrary data serving as input to a command to be executed by the device, if status code is 200.
(optional) Error details, if status code is >= 400.
Status Codes:
200 (OK): The event has been accepted and put to a persistent store for delivery to consumers. The response contains a command for the device to execute.
202 (Accepted): The event has been accepted and put to a persistent store for delivery to consumers.
400 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons for this include:
The content type header is missing.
The request body is empty but the event is not of type
empty-notification
string
This property will only be set if an authenticated gateway has connected to the adapter. It will contain the id of the device (connected to the gateway) that the command is targeted at.
Authenticated gateways will receive commands for devices which do not connect to a protocol adapter directly but instead are connected to the gateway. Corresponding devices have to be configured so that they can be used with a gateway. See
Configuring Gateway Devices
for details.
A gateway can open a link to receive commands for
all
devices it acts on behalf of. An authenticated gateway can also open a receiver link for commands targeted at a
specific
device.
When processing an incoming command message, the protocol adapter will give precedence to a device-specific command consumer matching the command target device, whether it was created by a gateway or by the device itself. If multiple such consumer links have been created, by multiple gateways and/or from the device itself, the gateway or device that last created the consumer link will get the command messages.
If no device-specific command consumer exists for a command target device, but
one
gateway, that may act on behalf of the device, has opened a generic, device-unspecific command consumer link, then the command message is sent to that gateway.
If
multiple
gateways have initiated such generic subscriptions, the protocol adapter may have to decide to which gateway a particular command message will be sent to. In case the command target device has already sent a telemetry, event or command response message via a gateway and if that gateway has created such a command subscription, that gateway will be chosen. Otherwise one gateway that may act on behalf of the command target device and that has an open subscription will be chosen randomly to receive the command message.
Example
A subscription to commands for all devices that a gateway acts on behalf of looks like this:
A subscription to commands for a specific device can be done like this:
The adapter will then publish
Request/Response
commands for devices, that the gateway has acted on behalf of, to topic
and
one-way
commands to topic
.
For example, a request/response command for device
4711
with name
The given device does not belong to the given tenant.
4.04 (Not Found): The request cannot be processed because the device is disabled or does not exist.
4.13 (Request Entity Too Large): The request cannot be processed because the request body exceeds the maximum supported size.
4.29 (Too Many Requests): The request cannot be processed because the tenant’s message limit for the current period is exceeded.
5.03 (Service Unavailable): The request cannot be processed because there is no consumer of telemetry data for the given tenant connected to Hono.
This resource MUST be used by devices that have not authenticated to the protocol adapter. Note that this requires the
HONO_COAP_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
configuration property to be explicitly set to
false
.

Publish some JSON data for device

The absolute path to the (PKCS8) PEM file containing the private key that the server should use for signing tokens asserting a device’s registration status. When using this variable, other services that need to validate the tokens issued by this service need to be configured with the corresponding certificate/public key. Alternatively, a symmetric key can be used for signing (and validating) by setting the
HONO_REGISTRY_SVC_SIGNING_SHARED_SECRET
variable. If none of these variables is set, the server falls back to the key indicated by the
HONO_REGISTRY_AMP_KEY_PATH
variable. If that variable is also not set, startup of the server fails.
HONO_REGISTRY_SVC_SIGNING_SHARED_SECRET
--hono.registry.svc.signing.sharedSecret
no
-
A string to derive a symmetric key from that is used for signing tokens asserting a device’s registration status. The key is derived from the string by using the bytes of the String’s UTF8 encoding. When setting the signing key using this variable, other services that need to validate the tokens issued by this service need to be configured with the same key. Alternatively, an asymmetric key pair can be used for signing (and validating) by setting the
HONO_REGISTRY_SVC_SIGNING_KEY_PATH
variable. If none of these variables is set, startup of the server fails.
.
403 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The given tenant is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.
The given device does not belong to the given tenant.
404 (Not Found): The request cannot be processed because the device is disabled or does not exist.
413 (Request Entity Too Large): The request cannot be processed because the request body exceeds the maximum supported size.
429 (Too Many Requests): The request cannot be processed because the tenant’s message limit for the current period is exceeded.
503 (Service Unavailable): The request cannot be processed because there is no consumer of events for the given tenant connected to Hono.
This resource MUST be used by devices that have not authenticated to the protocol adapter. Note that this requires the
HONO_HTTP_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
configuration property to be explicitly set to
false
.
Examples
Publish some JSON data for device
4711
:
If
multiple
gateways have opened a generic command consumer link, the protocol adapter may have to decide to which gateway a particular command message will be sent to. In case the command target device has already sent a telemetry, event or command response message via a gateway and if that gateway has opened a command consumer link, that gateway will be chosen. Otherwise one gateway that may act on behalf of the command target device and that has opened a command consumer link will be chosen randomly to receive the command message.
Sending a Response to a Command
A device only needs to respond to commands that contain a
reply-to
address and a
correlation-id
. However, if the application expects a response, then devices must publish a response back to the application. Devices may use the same anonymous sender link for this purpose that they also use for sending telemetry data and events.
The adapter supports
AT LEAST ONCE
delivery of command response messages only. A client therefore MUST set the
settled
property to
true
and the
rcv-settle-mode
setBrightness
from an application might look like this:
A corresponding
one-way
command might look like this:
Note that the topic in the latter case doesn’t contain a request identifier.
Sending a Response to a Command (authenticated Device)
An authenticated device MUST send the response to a previously received command to the topic

When testing manually I found out that there was still a bug which wasn't spotted by our automated tests: my changes in itself were consistent, but when deployed upon data created with a version before my changes there was an incompatibility due to a missing annotation on TenantDto.
This is fixed now. In the process I also made all DTOs immutable.

Custom Message Mapping
This protocol adapter supports transformation of messages that have been uploaded by devices before they get forwarded to downstream consumers.
Experimental
This feature is useful in scenarios where devices are connected to the adapter via a gateway but the gateway is not able to include the device ID in the topic that the gateway publishes data to. The gateway will use the plain
telemetry
or
event
topics in this case. The message payload will usually contain the identifier of the device that the data originates from.

Implementation of the new HTTP management API for tenants, devices and credentials.
The health check endpoints of services can now be called securely via TLS. Please refer to the protocol adapter
configuration guides
for the new parameters available.
The
Tenant API
now optionally allows specifying
minimum message size
. If it is specified, then the payload size of the incoming telemetry, event and command messages are calculated in accordance with the
minimum message size
by the AMQP, HTTP and MQTT protocol adapters and then recorded in the metrics system. See
Metrics
for more details.
Fixes & Enhancements
The automatic reconnect handling of the
HonoConnection
implementation has been improved and now applies an exponential back-off algorithm. The behavior can be configured using the
true

HONO_REGISTRY_SVC_FILENAME

HONO_TENANT_SVC_CACHE_MAX_AGE

The maximum period of time (seconds) that information returned by the service’s operations may be cached for.
HONO_TENANT_SVC_FILENAME
--hono.tenant.svc.filename
no
/var/lib/hono/device-registry/
tenants.json

is set to

hono-ttd
: The number of seconds the device will wait for the response.
(optional)
hono-ttl
: The
time-to-live
in number of seconds for event messages.
Request Body:
(required) Arbitrary payload encoded according to the given content type.
Response Headers:
(optional)
content-type
: A media type describing the semantics and format of payload contained in the response body. This header will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device which requires input data.
(optional)
hono-command
: The name of the command to execute. This header will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.

property of the command request message.
correlation-id

properties
string
MUST contain the value of the
correlation-id
property of the command request message.
status
yes
application-properties
integer
MUST contain a status code indicating the outcome of processing the command at the device (see
Command & Control API
for details).
The mechanism works as follows: 1. A client uploads a message to the MQTT adapter. 1. The adapter invokes the Device Registration service’s
assert Registration
operation using either the authenticated device’s identifier, if the topic does not contain a device ID, or the device ID from the topic. 1. If the assertion succeeds, the adapter creates the downstream message using the original message’s payload and the asserted device ID as the origin device. 1. If the response payload contains a value for the
mapper
property, the adapter tries to find a
mapper endpoint
configuration for the given value. If a mapper endpoint with a matching name has been configured for the adapter, 1. the adapter sends an HTTP request to the endpoint which contains the original message’s payload in the request body. 1. If the response body is not empty, it is used as the downstream message’s payload. 1. If the response contains a
device_id
header and its value is different from the original device ID, then the adapter invokes the
assert Registration
operation again, this time using the mapped device ID instead of the original device ID. If the assertion succeeds, the adapter uses the asserted (mapped) device ID for the downstream message. 1. The adapter forwards the downstream message.
Please refer to the
Device Registry Management API
for how to register a
mapper
for a device. Please refer to the
MQTT Adapter Admin Guide
(optional)

: The
hono-command
query parameter contains the name of the command to execute. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.

for commands expecting a response. In the latter case, the
location-path
option contains exactly the URI-path that the device must use when sending its response to the command. Note that in both cases the
path segments indicate the device that the command is targeted at. This option will only be present if the response contains a command to be executed by the device.
Response Body:
(optional) Arbitrary data serving as input to a command to be executed by the device, if status code is 2.05 (Content).
(optional) Error details, if status code is >= 4.00.

Response Caching
The clients created by a Hono client factory support the caching of responses received in response to service invocations. Caching can greatly improve performance by preventing costly invocations of remote service operations. However, it usually only makes sense for resources that do not change too frequently. The Hono client follows the
approach to caching used in HTTP 1.1
. In particular, it supports
cache directives
that a service includes in the response messages it sends back to the Hono client.
In order to enable caching, the
org.eclipse.hono.client.impl.HonoClientImpl
factory class needs to be configured with a cache manager using the
setCacheManager
method. Any specific client created by the factory will then cache responses to service invocations based on the following rules:
If the response contains a
no-cache
directive, the response is not cached at all.
Otherwise, if the response contains a

Response Body:
(optional) Arbitrary data serving as input to a command to be executed by the device, if status code is 200.
(optional) Error details, if status code is >= 400.
Status Codes:
200 (OK): The event has been accepted and put to a persistent store for delivery to consumers. The response contains a command for the device to execute.
202 (Accepted): The event has been accepted and put to a persistent store for delivery to consumers.
400 (Bad Request): The request cannot be processed. Possible reasons for this include:
The content type header is missing.
The request body is empty but the event is not of type
empty-notification
.
401 (Unauthorized): The request cannot be processed because the request does not contain valid credentials.
403 (Forbidden): The request cannot be processed because the device’s registration status cannot be asserted. Possible reasons for this include:
The tenant that the gateway belongs to is not allowed to use this protocol adapter.
Examples
The AMQP adapter client can be used to simulate a device which receives commands and sends responses back to the application. The command line client is used to simulate an application sending commands to devices and receiving command responses from devices.
Start the AMQP adapter client, as follows:
After successfully starting the client, a message indicating that the device is ready to receive commands will be printed to standard output. The device is now waiting to receive commands from applications.
To send a command to the device, open a new terminal shell and start the command application, as shown below:
Note
Change into the
cli
directory before running the command above to start the command application. If you change into the target directory (i.e
cli/target
), then the client will not be able to locate to certificate needed to connect to the messaging network.
Once the command application starts successfully, enter a command name, payload and content-type of the command to send to the device.
After sending the command, the device (i.e. AMQP command client) will print out the command name and payload that it receives and automatically sends a command response to the application.
Downstream Meta Data
The adapter includes the following meta data in the application properties of messages being sent downstream:
Name

… the management side reports back two entries … which is correct … for the adapter side, it reports back only one, which is correct as well, because the other entry is still invalid for the adapter, and the adapter API doesn't hand out invalid entries
Jens Reimann
@ctron
From the Hono docs:
The device registry may choose to not return information which is not suitable for authentication a device. This includes for example the enabled property. If set to false, then the device registry may choose to treat this request as if no credentials would be found. For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.

Sorry for raising this comment now. I noticed this just now with the merge of the PR
#2241
for adjusting the tests.
The Credentials API docs says:
Adapters MUST only consider secrets for authentication which
AFAIK the credentials API includes all the secrets irrespective of the
not-before
&
not-after
property. Based on the above quotes, the adapters are responsible for filtering them out. Various
interfaces, and the
base
and
complete
implementation classes for services got deprecated, and are planned to be removed in a future release. Also see
Device registry changes
for more information.
The example Device Registry that comes with Hono now implements the new HTTP management API. Consequently, the URI endpoints for managing the content of the registry have changed accordingly.
The configuration parameters for the health check endpoint were moved from
hono.app
to
hono.healthCheck
and renamed.

Using TLS
The factory can be configured to use TLS for
authenticating the server during connection establishment and
(optionally) authenticating to the server using a client certificate (if the server supports this)
In order to authenticate the server by means of the server’s certificate, the factory needs to be configured with a
trust anchor
containing the
certificate authorities
that the client trusts. The trust anchor can be configured explicitly by means of the
and
variables. This is most useful in cases where the server’s certificate has not been signed by one of the public root CAs that are contained in the JRE’s standard trust store. However, if the server does use a certificate signed by such a public CA, then it is sufficient to set the
variable to
true

I think the reason why this property is there (this is also only migrated from the old BaseDto class) is: all of our MongoDb collections have an "_id" property. When reading data from MongoDb
JsonObject.mapTo()
is called which then would fail without that annotation.
Hence allowing sub-classes to decide on their own would be possible, but all DTOs (except the one for the file-based implementation would require adding at least
@JsonIgnoreProperties("_id")
or we introduce a "MongoDbBaseDto" from which the other MongoDb DTOs are derived which I would do rather than duplicating this in every DTO.

implementations already do this by using
CredentialsObject.getCandidateSecrets(...)
where the secrets are already being filtered out based on the validity period. IMHO we need not filter secrets based on the validity period in the credentials API implementation. I don't think we need to adapt the tests as in
#2241
EDIT:
@sophokles73
@ctron
In another place, it is written as below in the Credentials API.
For secrets for example, this could mean that the device registry does not return secrets which are not valid at the current point in time.
From this point of view, filtering secrets based on the validity period in the device registry, is also valid. So I think we can keep the code as it is and merge it. With this perspective, it also makes sense with
#2241
. IMHO we could later revisit the credentials API and sort it out with various implementations.

Device registry changes
The section summarizes changes made for 1.0-M5 in the device registry.
During the development of Hono 1.0, we defined a new HTTP API for managing information stored in the device registry. This API replaces the current, provisional API, which was originally intended for tests to manipulate the file based device registry during system tests. The new HTTP based API is intended to replace the existing HTTP API, as well as the management part of the AMQP based API.
The first major change is, that all the
complete
classes got deprecated. As they are based on the services for the protocol adapters. And those services are no longer considered to be used for managing information. The replacement for those classes are the new management APIs.
Each of the three APIs got a companion API for
management
, which are located in the
org.eclipse.hono.service.management
base package.
the server will not try to load tenants from the file specified by the
HONO_TENANT_SVC_FILENAME
property during startup.
The variables only need to be set if the default value does not match your environment.
Port Configuration
The file based Device Registry supports configuration of both an AMQP based endpoint exposing the Tenant, Device Registration and Credentials APIs as well as an HTTP based endpoint providing resources for managing tenants, registration information and credentials as defined by the
Registry Management API
. Both endpoints can be configured to listen for connections on
a secure port only (default) or
an insecure port only or
both a secure and an insecure port (dual port configuration)
The registry will fail to start if none of the ports is configured properly.
The following sections apply to configuring both the AMQP and the HTTP endpoint. The environment variables to use for configuring the HTTP endpoint are the same as the ones for the AMQP endpoint, substituting
_AMQP_
with
. In this case the credentials provided by the gateway during connection establishment with the protocol adapter are used to authenticate the gateway whereas the parameters from the URI are used to identify the device that the gateway publishes data for.
The protocol adapter checks the gateway’s authority to publish data on behalf of the device implicitly by means of retrieving a
registration assertion
for the device from the
configured Device Registration service
.
Examples
Publish some JSON data for device
4712
:
NB
The example above assumes that a gateway device has been registered with
hashed-password
credentials with
auth-id
gw
and password
gw-secret
registered for the device at either the
tenant
or the
device level
. The values of the default properties are determined as follows:
If the message already contains a non-empty property of the same name, the value if unchanged.
Otherwise, if a default property of the same name is defined in the device’s registration information, that value is used.
Otherwise, if a default property of the same name is defined for the tenant that the device belongs to, that value is used.
Note that of the standard AMQP 1.0 message properties only the
content-type
and
ttl
can be set this way to a default value.
Event Message Time-to-live
Events published by devices will usually be persisted by the AMQP Messaging Network in order to support deferred delivery to downstream consumers. In most cases the AMQP Messaging Network can be configured with a maximum
time-to-live
to apply to the events so that the events will be removed from the persistent store if no consumer has attached to receive the event before the message expires.

and
variables can be used to set the path and password of a key store which contains both the certificate as well as the private key.
The factory supports TLS 1.2 only by default for negotiating TLS sessions with servers. Additional protocols can be enabled by setting the
variable to a comma separated list of protocol names as defined in the
vert.x documentation
. However, great care should be taken when enabling older protocols because most of them are vulnerable to attacks.
Address rewriting
In some multi-tenant messaging environments external can have their addresses internally mapped to enforce consistent namespaces. For example, the addresses can be prefixed by the virtual host the client uses to connect or some other internal identifier. So address like
telemetry/DEFAULT_TENANT
would be internally represented as
test-vhost/telemetry/DEFAULT_TENANT
for example.
To successfully address those external clients, infrastructure Hono components need to apply the same mapping rules. The client factory can be configured to automatically rewrite addresses when opening links to the AMQP network. The

i think it should … however, I think it makes more sense to add some kind of method
deviceRegistryOnlyReturnsValidEntries() -> bool
and take the value of that to test for either 1 or 2 expected entries
for JDBC that should return

false
because in the future, no one will remember why either 1 or 2 is "ok" for this test :)

The new default file based device registry, was modified to use the new class hierarchy and support the new management model.

_HTTP_
, e.g.
HONO_REGISTRY_HTTP_KEY_PATH
instead of
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_KEY_PATH
.
Secure Port Only
The server needs to be configured with a private key and certificate in order to open a TLS secured port.
There are two alternative ways for doing so:
Setting the
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_KEY_STORE_PATH
and the
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD

Command & Control
The HTTP adapter enables devices to receive commands that have been sent by business applications. Commands are delivered to the device by means of an HTTP response message. That means a device first has to send a request, indicating how long it will wait for the response. That request can either be a telemetry or event message, with a
hono-ttd
header or query parameter (
ttd
for
time till disconnect
) specifying the number of seconds the device will wait for the response. The business application can react on that message by sending a command message, targeted at the device. The HTTP adapter will then send the command message as part of the HTTP response message with status
200
(OK) to the device. If the HTTP adapter receives no command message in the given time period, a
202
In order to support environments where the AMQP Messaging Network cannot be configured accordingly, the protocol adapter supports setting a downstream event message’s

. It is there to show the compatibility with the older class hierarchy, using the, now deprecated,
base
and
complete
classes. Newer implementations should not be build on this model.
Clients of the
base
variants of the services, like the protocol adapters, do not need to make any changes.
Implementations of the device registry services, using the existing
base
and
complete
can re-use that model, but are encouraged to migrate to the new model as soon as possible, as the legacy model is planned to be removed. The only impacting change is that the service interfaces no longer extend from
Verticle
directly, but that has been moved to the
base
implementation.
Implementations of the services for protocol adapters (the non-management API), can switch to the new class hierarchy by dropping inheritance to the
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_CERT_PATH
variables in order to load the key and certificate from two separate PEM files in PKCS8 format.
When starting up, the server will bind a TLS secured socket to the default secure port (
5671
for AMQP and
8443
for HTTP). The port number can also be set explicitly using the
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_PORT
variable.
The
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_BIND_ADDRESS
variable can be used to specify the network interface that the port should be exposed on. By default, the port is bound to the
loopback device
only, i.e. the port will only be accessible from the local host. Setting this variable to
0.0.0.0
will let the port being bound to
all
network interfaces (be careful not to expose the port unintentionally to the outside world).
(Accepted) response will be sent to the device (provided the request was valid).
Specifying the Time a Device will wait for a Response
The adapter lets devices indicate the number of seconds they will wait for a response by setting a header or a query parameter.
Using an HTTP Header
The (optional)
hono-ttd
header can be set in requests for publishing telemetry data or events.
Example:
Using a Query Parameter
Alternatively the
hono-ttd
query parameter can be used:
Commands handled by gateways
Authenticated gateways will receive commands for devices which do not connect to a protocol adapter directly but instead are connected to the gateway. Corresponding devices have to be configured so that they can be used with a gateway. See
Configuring Gateway Devices
for details.
A gateway can send a request with the

Good point, wasn't aware of that. Basically I moved the code of the old BaseDto (org.eclipse.hono.deviceregistry.mongodb.model.BaseDto) where this was already in place. The old BaseDto also allowed to create an instance even if those properties were null.
So I guess
required = True
can be removed.

New Features
Hono’s protocol adapters and the other components now support using ECC based server certificates. The protocol adapters also support authenticating devices which present an ECC based client certificate. The example configuration now uses ECC based certificates by default.
Hono now specifies a
Insecure Port Only
The secure port will mostly be required for production scenarios. However, it might be desirable to expose a non-TLS secured port instead, e.g. for testing purposes. In any case, the non-secure port needs to be explicitly enabled either by
explicitly setting
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT
to a valid port number, or by
implicitly configuring the default port (
5672
for AMQP and
8080
for HTTP) to be used by setting
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_ENABLED
to
true
.
The server issues a warning on the console if one of the insecure ports is set to the corresponding default secure port.
The
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_BIND_ADDRESS
variable can be used to specify the network interface that the port should be exposed on. By default, the port is bound to the
hono-ttd
header or query parameter on the
/event
or
/telemetry
URI, indicating its readiness to receive a command for
any
device it acts on behalf of. Note that in this case, the business application will be notified with the gateway id in the
device_id
property of the downstream message.
An authenticated gateway can also indicate its readiness to receive a command targeted at a
specific
device. For that, the
or
URI is to be used, containing the id of the device to receive a command for. The business application will receive a notification with that device id.
If there are multiple concurrent requests with a
hono-ttd
header or query parameter, sent by the command target device and/or one or more of its potential gateways, the HTTP adapter will choose the device or gateway to send the command to as follows:

A request done by the command target device or by a gateway specifically done for that device, has precedence.

Device Connection API
and contains an exemplary implementation of this API included in the device registry component. The purpose of the API is to be able to set and retrieve information about the connections from devices or gateways to the protocol adapters.
This version implements the new HTTP management API for tenants, devices, and credentials.
Fixes & Enhancements
The Hono Sandbox’s protocol adapters support using the gateway mode again.
The
Getting Started
guide has been rewritten to use the
Hono Sandbox
or a local Minikube cluster instead of Docker Swarm.
The MQTT adapter now closes the network connection to device on publish failures.
API Changes
The optional methods of the
Tenant API
have been removed. Implementations of the Tenant API are encouraged to expose the
tenants
loopback device
only, i.e. the port will only be accessible from the local host. This variable might be used to e.g. expose the non-TLS secured port on a local interface only, thus providing easy access from within the local network, while still requiring encrypted communication when accessed from the outside over public network infrastructure.
Setting this variable to
0.0.0.0
will let the port being bound to
all
network interfaces (be careful not to expose the port unintentionally to the outside world).
Dual Port
In test setups and some production scenarios Hono server may be configured to open one secure
and
one insecure port at the same time.
This is achieved by configuring both ports correctly (see above). The server will fail to start if both ports are configured to use the same port number.
Since the secure port may need different visibility in the network setup compared to the secure port, it has it’s own binding address
HONO_REGISTRY_AMQP_INSECURE_PORT_BIND_ADDRESS
. This can be used to narrow the visibility of the insecure port to a local network e.g., while the secure port may be visible worldwide.
Ephemeral Ports
A request done by the command target device or by a gateway specifically done for that device, has precedence. If there are multiple, concurrent such requests, the last one will get the command message (if received) in its response. Note that the other requests won’t be answered with a command message in their response event if the business application sent multiple command messages. That means commands for a single device can only be requested sequentially, not in parallel.
If the above doesn’t apply, a single
hono-ttd
request on the
/event
or
/telemetry
URI, sent by a gateway that the command target device is configured for, will get the command message in its response.
If there are multiple, concurrent such requests by different gateways, all configured for the command target device, the request by the gateway will be chosen, through which the target device has last sent a telemetry or event message. If the target device hasn’t sent a message yet and it is thereby unknown via which gateway the device communicates, then one of the requests will be chosen randomly to set the command in its response.

We could use aggregation here having two properties in DeviceWithStatus: a device property (of type Device) and a status property (of type Status). Since the "status" JSON property needs to be on the same level as the other properties of a device, we would need to add
@JsonUnwrapped
on the device property.

Default properties can now also be set at the tenant level, affecting all devices belonging to the tenant. Please refer to the
protocol adapter user guides
for details.
CredentialsClientImpl
now supports caching of response data received from a Credentials service based on
cache directives
. The protocol adapters are now equipped to cache the response from the Credentials Service. The protocol adapters support configuration variables to set the default cache timeout, the minimum and maximum cache sizes for this service.
The example device registry’s Credentials service implementation now includes a
cache directive
in its response to the
get Credentials
operation which allows clients to cache credentials of type

gateway
component that is usually specific to the device’s communication protocol. It is the gateway component which then connects to a Hono protocol adapter and publishes data on behalf of the device(s). Examples of such a set up include devices using
SigFox
or
LoRa
for communication.
In these cases the protocol adapter will authenticate the gateway component instead of the device for which it wants to publish data. In order to verify that the gateway is
authorized
to publish data on behalf of the particular device, the protocol adapter should include the gateway’s device identifier (as determined during the authentication process) in its invocation of the Device Registration API’s
assert Device Registration
operation.
The Device Registry will then do the following: 1. Verify that the device exists and is enabled. 2. Verify that the gateway exists and is enabled. 3. Verify that the device’s registration information contains a property called
via
and that its value is either the gateway’s device identifier or a JSON array which contains the gateway’s device identifier as one of its values.
Only if all conditions are met, the Device Registry returns an assertion of the device’s registration status. The protocol adapter can then forward the published data to the AMQP Messaging Network in the same way as for any device that connects directly to the adapter.
The example configuration file (located at
/deploy/src/main/deploy/example-device-identities.json
) includes a device and a corresponding gateway configured in this way.

it looks like this method is suppose to be used with arbitrary types of data, e.g. Device, Tenant, CommonCredential, right? If so, then the field name used here should not be specific to the Device class, shouldn't it?

I see value in having this kind of factory methods in the subclasses in order to know in which context we want to create the instance. But in this class, a simple constructor accepting the parameters that are managed by this abstract class would suffice.

In the end the idea was to encapsulate the timestamp setting for subclasses:
forCreation()
makes sure that the created timestamp ist set while
forUpdate()
takes care of the updated timestamp. Since both methods take the same arguments I think this can't be implemented using a constructor?

tags when reporting telemetry messages using meter name
hono.messages.received
. This fixes an issue when using the Prometheus back end where the HTTP adapter failed to report messages that contained a TTD value and others that didn’t.

API Changes
The

HonoClient
interface which no longer serves as a factory for the arbitrary clients to the Hono service endpoints. It has been renamed to
HonoConnection
and now only represents the underlying AMQP connection to a peer and provides methods for managing the connection state and registering listeners for arbitrary life-cycle events of the connection. In addition to this, several factory interfaces have been added which can be used to create specific clients to Hono’s arbitrary services. All of the former

If the message already contains a non-empty property of the same name, the value if unchanged.
Otherwise, if a default property of the same name is defined in the device’s registration information, that value is used.
Otherwise, if a default property of the same name is defined for the tenant that the device belongs to, that value is used.
Note that of the standard AMQP 1.0 message properties only the
content-type
and
ttl
can be set this way to a default value.
Event Message Time-to-live
Events published by devices will usually be persisted by the AMQP Messaging Network in order to support deferred delivery to downstream consumers. In most cases the AMQP Messaging Network can be configured with a maximum
time-to-live
to apply to the events so that the events will be removed from the persistent store if no consumer has attached to receive the event before the message expires.
In order to support environments where the AMQP Messaging Network cannot be configured accordingly, the protocol adapter supports setting a downstream event message’s

I created a draft PR to illustrate what I mean (and to verify that I got you right):
9120c2e
Personally I do not see why having the constructor is better, besides that the implementation of the factory methods in BaseDto is slightly more complex as it uses generics. The downside is though that now setting the proper created and updated timestamps is done in the subclasses meaning it is duplicated. Also the FileBasedDto cannot reuse the static factory methods of the base class.

The reason why I added this is: if a client sends an update via a PUT request and uses copy&paste from a previous GET request to get the body's content it will have the status property in it. In order to make this convenient and not requiring the status property to be removed I set it to ignore here.
I'll use the literal as suggested.

I don't see the benefit of all the "dto" stuff, which isn't "dto" to some degree anyway. It looks like that introduces yet another abstraction layer in the code base, which diverges between the different implementations. But if everyone else is fine with that, I don't object.

has been added to support the sending of commands to devices and the receiving of responses in an asynchronous way. This can be used to decouple the sender and receiver from each other.
The
org.eclipse.hono.service.tenant.CompleteBaseTenantService
class now rejects malformed encodings of public keys/certificates included in a request to add a trust anchor to a tenant.
Deprecations
The
HonoClient.closeCommandConsumer()
method will be removed in Hono 1.0. The
CommandConsumer.close()
method should be used instead.
0.9
New Features
The MQTT adapter now supports commands to be published using QoS 1. Please refer to
MQTT adapter User Guide
for details.
The MQTT adapter now supports limiting the number of concurrent connections in order to prevent running out of resources. Please refer to
MQTT Adapter Configuration

@ctron
I agree that it isn't the really DTO pattern which is employed here, but this abstraction layer was already there in the MongoDb based registry, so I thought it was already agreed upon. Actually I thought it was envisioned to implement this as an abstraction layer when I asked in Gitter about this already being worked on (see Sep 11 09:19):
not yet, bit I think this should be implemented in a way that it covers all three (File, MongoDB and JDBC) using some base classes

The new
Helm deployment
for Kubernetes has been added. Please refer to
Helm based deployment guide
for details.
Fixes & Enhancements
org.eclipse.hono.util.RequestResponseResult
now provides access to AMQP application-properties conveyed in the response message.
The
org.eclipse.hono.service.registration.BaseRegistrationService
class now supports authorization of gateways (acting on behalf of a device) against a list of gateway identifiers instead of a single identifier only. For that purpose the
via
property of the device’s registration information may contain either a single string or a JSON array containing multiple strings. Based on this, a device can now be configured to connect via arbitrary gateways instead of just a single one.
API Changes
The layout and structure of the metrics reported by Hono have been changed substantially. Many of the existing meters and tags have been changed or replaced in order to provide a more consistent set of metrics and increase the value of the information being reported. The legacy metrics still remain unchanged, though. Please refer to the
Metrics definition
@ctron
Do you have an idea for an alternative way of having the (read-only) status properties in the different implementations? I believe we are all open for other proposals ...

In case of a failed connection attempt,
HonoClientImpl
will now determine based on the error whether it will re-try to connect to the peer. Before, reconnect attempts were done unconditionally, by default infinitely or up to the number of times defined in the
reconnectAttempts
property in the
ClientConfigProperties
. Now, when the outcome of the SASL handshake received from the peer during connection establishment indicates that invalid credentials were provided or that the server encountered a permanent error when handling the request, no further reconnect attempts will be done.
The deprecated methods have been removed from
org.eclipse.hono.client.MessageSender
and its implementations.
The Command & Control API’s
send a request/response command
operation has been changed. The response message to a command now must include the device and tenant identifiers of the device. Including these two properties should make it much easier to implement competing command response consumers in business applications. As a consequence, the
org.eclipse.hono.client.CommandResponse
’s factory methods have been changed to accept the tenant and device IDs as parameters.

connectTimeout
configuration variable for the
HonoClient
now defines the time to wait not only for the TCP/TLS connection establishment but also for the SASL handshake and the exchange of the AMQP
open
frame.
The (already deprecated) Hono Messaging component has been removed from Hono.
Deprecations
The script based deployment to Kubernetes has been deprecated and will be removed in the next version. The Helm based deployment should be used instead.
The
sendCommandResponse(String, String, Buffer, Map, int, SpanContext)
of the
org.eclipse.hono.client.CommandResponseSender
interface has been deprecated and will be removed in the next version. Custom protocol adapters should use
sendCommandResponse(CommandResponse, SpanContext)
instead.

New Features
The MQTT protocol adapter now supports authentication of devices using X.509 client certificates. Please refer to the
MQTT adapter user guide
for details regarding configuration.
Fixes & Enhancements
The OpenShift
source-to-image
(S2I) deployment is now the default OpenShift / OKD deployment. The plain OpenShift deployment, which had been deprecated in Hono 0.8, has been removed.
The protocol adapters can now be configured with a custom
DNS timeout
value, limiting the time that the adapter will wait for the response to a DNS query. By default, a DNS query will time out after 5 seconds. Please refer to the protocol adapter admin guides for details regarding the new configuration variable.
The following configuration variables have been added to
HonoClient
:
connectTimeout
: Sets a limit on the time that the client will wait for a TCP/TLS connection with the peer to be established. By default, a connection attempt will time out after 5 seconds.

We use
idleTimeout
: The idle timeout defines the amount of time after which a connection will be closed when no frames have been received from the remote peer. The default value is 16 seconds.
sendMessageTimeout
: Limits the time to wait for a downstream consumer’s acknowledgement of an event or command response message received from a device. The default value is 1 second.
Please refer to the
Hono Client Configuration guide
for details regarding the new configuration variables.
API Changes
Some of the
tags
used by Hono’s components when reporting metrics have been changed. The common tag

. The
protocol
tag formerly used by adapters to indicate the transport protocol that a message has been received over, has been replaced by the generic
component-name
tag which indicates the name of the component that a metric has been reported by. Please refer to the
Metrics API
for details. Note that these changes do not affect the legacy Graphite based metrics back end.
Deprecations
The Hono Messaging component is now deprecated and will be removed from Hono in version 0.9 altogether. The example deployment has not been using Hono Messaging since 0.6 and there is no practical reason for using it anymore.

The default Micrometer back end is now Prometheus, the Grafana dash boards have been updated to retrieve data from Prometheus instead of the old InfluxDB. The Graphite based legacy metrics format can still be used but requires building Hono from source and activating the
metrics-graphite
Maven build profile. Please refer to the
Monitoring admin guide
for details.
The
org.eclipse.hono.service.credentials.CompleteBaseCredentialsService
class now supports the transparent
on-the-fly
hashing of clear text passwords contained in
hashed-password
credentials. Please refer to the
Device Registry user guide
for details.
Fixes & Enhancements
The base classes for implementing the Device Registration and Tenant APIs have been instrumented with OpenTracing. New variants of the
RegistrationService.assertRegistration
,
TenantService.get
and
CredentialsService.get
methods have been added which also accept an OpenTracing span as a parameter. The default implementations of these methods still default to the previously existing methods. In
RegistrationService
implementations based on
BaseRegistrationService
an OpenTracing span will be created, passed on to the
assertRegistration
method and finished eventually. The same applies to
TenantService
implementations based on
BaseTenantService
concerning the
get
method and to
CredentialsService
implementations based on
BaseCredentialsService
concerning the
get
method.
API Changes
The
org.eclipse.hono.service.credentials.CompleteBaseCredentialsService
class now requires an
org.eclipse.hono.auth.HonoPasswordEncoder
to be passed into its constructor. The
org.eclipse.hono.auth.SpringBasedHonoPasswordEncoder
has been added as a default implementation for this purpose.
The
Tenant API
now optionally allows specifying an X.509 certificate instead of a public key when defining a trusted CA.
