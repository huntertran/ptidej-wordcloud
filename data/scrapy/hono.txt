Road Map
Connect. Command. Control.
Eclipse Hono™ provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol.
Millions of Devices
Hono is designed for connecting large numbers of IoT devices. Its micro service based architecture and use of a reactive programming model allow for scaling out horizontally.
Uniform API
Connect a multitude of different types of devices to your (cloud) back end. Communicate with all of them via the same simple API regardless of the device protocol.
IoT Protocols
Hono supports devices communicating via common IoT protocols like HTTP, MQTT and AMQP out of the box.
Messaging Patterns
Hono provides APIs for important IoT communication patterns:
Telemetry
and
Event
messages can be used by devices to report sensor readings whereas applications can use
Command & Control
to invoke operations on devices.
Secure
Hono is designed for security by default. It supports common authentication mechanisms like username/password and X.509 client certificates to verify a device’s identity and uses transport layer security (TLS) when communicating with devices.
Extensible
Your device uses a custom protocol? Hono provides a simple mechanism to add custom protocol adapters.

Wanna tell us what you think about Eclipse Hono™? What we can improve? Which feature is missing? Or just discuss architectural issues?
Ask a Question
We try to maintain a steady pace of releases every three months with milestones in between. However, due to changes in requirements over time and because we all have only limited time to spend on Hono, the scope of the releases may change over time as well. The best way to make sure that a certain feature that you anticipate or need the most actually makes it into a release, is by
becoming a contributor
and/or committer to Hono yourself.

Eclipse Hono’s service components are provided by means of pre-built Docker images available from
Docker Hub
. These container images can be deployed to popular container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and OpenShift.
The release archive contains all files necessary to deploy Hono to a Kubernetes cluster using the
Helm package manager
.
Eclipse Hono 1.0-M7 Archive
Download and extract the archive and follow the
deployment guide
.
A Java based command line client for consuming telemetry data and events from Hono is available for download as well:
Sandbox
We are providing a publicly accessible Eclipse Hono™
sandbox
environment at
hono.eclipse.org
. The main purpose of the system is to provide an environment for experimenting with devices and how to connect them to Hono without the need for setting up a local instance.
The sandbox hosts a Hono instance consisting of the same components as described in the
Getting started Guide
. All services are exposed via the same ports as used in the guide.
Take note
The sandbox is intended for
testing purposes only
. Under no circumstances should it be used for any production use case. It is also
not allowed
to register with nor publish any personally identifiable information to any of the sandbox’s services.
You can use the sandbox without revealing who you are or any information about yourself. The APIs of the Device Registry running on the sandbox can be used anonymously for creating tenants, register devices and add credentials. However, data can only be added but
cannot be updated or removed
using the corresponding APIs. This is to prevent others from tampering with your tenants/devices/credentials. In order to minimize the risk of dissemination of data, all tenants, devices and credentials are
deleted periodically

Road Map
Getting started with Eclipse Hono
This guide will walk you through an interactive example usage scenario of Eclipse Hono. You will learn how devices can use Hono’s protocol adapters to publish telemetry data and events using both HTTP and/or MQTT. You will also see how a downstream application can consume this data using Hono’s north bound API without requiring the application to know anything about the specifics of the communication protocols used by the devices.
Prerequisites for the Getting started Guide
This guide requires several tools to be installed on your computer. During the course of this guide, the devices publishing data will be represented by means of running some command line tools for posting HTTP requests and for publishing MQTT packets.
Curl HTTP Command Line Client
The
curl
command is used in this guide for registering devices with Hono and for simulating a device publishing data using HTTP. On most *nix like systems
curl
will probably already be installed. Otherwise, please refer to the
Curl project page
for installation instructions.
Mosquitto MQTT Command Line Client
The
mosquitto_pub
command is used in this guide for simulating a device publishing data using the MQTT protocol. Please refer to the
Mosquitto project page
for installation instructions, if you do not have it installed already.

AMQP
) or if not set, the protocol adapter determines a reasonable value based on the available resources like memory and CPU.
Why do I see
MemoryBasedConnectionLimitStrategy - Not enough memory
in the logs of a protocol adapter?
The protocol adapter can not allocate enough memory for handle even a small number of connections reliably. Please provide more memory. To try it anyways, configure the maximum number of concurrent connections, as documented in the Admin Guides of the protocol adapter (
MQTT
,
AMQP
).
How do I use client certificates for authentication?
Make sure that you are able to connect to the respective protocol adapter with TLS (see the
Admin Guide
for configuration).
Here
is an article, that provides a complete walk-through guide for all required steps. Additionally you can use and adapt the script for the creation of demo certificates in the Hono repository. More information can be found in the User Guide of the protocol adapter (

).

Eclipse Hono 1.0-M7 Command Line Client
The client requires a Java 11 runtime environment to run.
Please refer to the
Admin Guide
for details regarding the command line options that the client supports.
Source Code
The source code can be cloned (using
Git
) or downloaded from the
Eclipse Hono GitHub repository
. The
Building from Source
guide provides instructions on how to build Hono locally.

We do not collect nor share with third parties any of the data you provide when registering tenants, devices and credentials. We also do not inspect nor collect nor share with third parties any of the data your devices publish to the sandbox.
Play fair!
The sandbox’s computing resources are (quite) limited. The number of devices that can be registered per tenant is therefore limited to 100.
The sandbox will be running the latest Hono release or milestone (if available). However, we may also deploy a more recent nightly build without further notice.
In order to minimize the risk of collisions of device identities and credentials and to reduce the risk of others
guessing
your identifiers, you are advised to use
non-trivial, hard-to-guess
tenant and device identifiers (e.g. a UUID).
The Apache Artemis instance we use for brokering events is configured with a maximum queue size of 1MB, i.e. you can only buffer up to 1 MB of events (per tenant) without having any consumer connected that actually processes the events. Once that limit is reached, no more events will be accepted by the protocol adapters for the corresponding tenant. In addition to that, events that are not consumed will automatically be removed from the queue(s) after five minutes.
The sandbox exposes its API endpoints on both a TLS secured as well as an unsecured port. The secure ports use a Let’s Encrypt certificate so you should not need to configure a specific trust store on your client in order to interact with them. Please note that when using the unsecured ports, the information you exchange with the sandbox might be exposed to eavesdroppers. We therefore
strongly suggest
that you use the secure ports only, if possible! When using the
Hono client
to access the sandbox’ Telemetry and/or Event APIs, make sure to not set a trust store explicitly but instead set the
tlsEnabled
property to
true
. The command line client binary is available from the
downloads page
and can be used to consume telemetry/event messages from the sandbox as below:

Conventions
The
groupId
of all Hono modules is
org.eclipse.hono
,
artifactId
always starts with
hono-
.
Modules producing a Docker image generally use
as the image’s repository name.
All code complies with the formatting rules defined by the settings files in the
eclipse
folder.
Modules implementing one of the Hono APIs are sub-modules of
services
.
Making your Changes
Fork the repository on GitHub
.
The installation of the Mosquitto command line client is optional. If you do not install it then you will not be able to simulate an MQTT based device but otherwise will be able to get the same results described in this guide.
Hono Command Line Client
The Hono command line client is used in this guide for simulating an application that consumes telemetry data and events published by devices. The client is available from
Hono’s download page
. Note that running the command line client requires a Java 11 runtime environment being installed locally.
Hono Sandbox
The most important prerequisite is, of course, a Hono instance that you can work with.
The most straightforward option to use for this guide is the
Hono Sandbox
which is running on infrastructure provided by the Eclipse Foundation and which is publicly accessible from the internet.
Using the Sandbox, there is no need to set up your own Hono instance locally. However, it requires several non-standard ports being accessible from your computer which may not be the case, e.g. if you are behind a firewall restricting internet access to a few standard ports only.
You can verify if you can access the relevant ports of the Sandbox by running the following command and comparing the output:
If you get output like this
you can use the Sandbox. Run the following commands to set some environment variables which will be used during the guide
and then proceed to the
Overview of Hono Components
.
However, if the
curl
command yielded different output, you will need to set up Hono locally as described in the next section.
Setting up a local Hono Instance
In case you cannot access the Hono Sandbox as described above, you will need to set up an instance of Hono running on your local computer. For evaluation purposes a single node

For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
Prometheus
instance for storing metrics data from services and protocol adapters.
A
Grafana
instance providing a dash board visualizing the collected metrics data.
In the example scenario used in the remainder of this guide, the devices will connect to the HTTP and MQTT adapters in order to publish telemetry data and events. The devices will be authenticated using information stored in the Device Registry. The data is then forwarded downstream to the example application via the AMQP Messaging Network.
Registering Devices
When a device tries to connect to one of Hono’s protocol adapters, the protocol adapter first tries to authenticate the device using information kept in the Device Registry. The information maintained in the registry includes the
tenant
(a logical scope) that the device belongs to, the device’s unique
identity
within the tenant and the
credentials
used by the device for authentication.
Before a device can connect to Hono and publish any data, the corresponding information needs to be added to the Device Registry.
Creating a new Tenant
Register a tenant using Hono’s Device Registry’s management HTTP API (a random tenant identifier will be generated):
Random tenant ID value
You will receive a randomly generated tenantId value. It will probably be different than the value given in this example. Make sure to export it to an environment variable to make the following steps easier:
Adding a Device to the Tenant
Register a device using Hono’s Device Registry’s management HTTP API (a random device identifier will be assigned):
Random device ID value
Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.
You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Otherwise, if you are using a local Minikube cluster:
The client can then be started from the command line as follows (make sure to replace
my-tenant
with your tenant identifier):
Publishing Telemetry Data to the HTTP Adapter
Now that the downstream application is running, devices can start publishing telemetry data and events using Hono’s protocol adapters. First, you will simulate a device publishing data to Hono using the HTTP protocol. Go back to the original terminal and run:

Jakarta JSON Binding
Jakarta JSON Processing
Jakarta Server Pages
Jakarta Standard Tag Library

If you have started the downstream application as described above, you should now see the telemetry message being logged to the application’s console in the other terminal. The output should look something like this:
You can publish more data simply by re-running the
curl
command above with arbitrary payload.
Service Unavailable
When you invoke the command above for the first time, you may get the following response:
This is because the first request to publish data for a given tenant is used as the trigger to establish a tenant specific sender link with the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network to forward the data over. However, the HTTP adapter may not receive credits quickly enough for the request to be served immediately. You can simply ignore this response and re-submit the command.
If you haven’t started the application you will always get
503 Resource Unavailable
responses because Hono does not accept any telemetry data from devices if there aren’t any consumers connected that are interested in the data. The reason for this is that Hono
never
persists Telemetry data and thus it doesn’t make any sense to accept and process telemetry data if there is no consumer to deliver it to.
The HTTP Adapter also supports publishing telemetry messages using
at least once
delivery semantics. For information on how that works and additional examples for interacting with Hono via HTTP, please refer to the
HTTP Adapter’s User Guide
.
Publishing Events to the HTTP Adapter
In a similar way you can upload events:
Again, you should see the event being logged to the console of the downstream application.

Publishing Telemetry Data to the MQTT Adapter
Devices can also publish data to Hono using the MQTT protocol. If you have installed the
mosquitto_pub
command line client, you can run the following command to publish arbitrary telemetry data to Hono’s MQTT adapter using QoS 0:
Again, you should now see the telemetry message being logged to console of the downstream application.
The MQTT Adapter also supports publishing telemetry messages using QoS 1. For information on how that works and additional examples for interacting with Hono via MQTT, please refer to the
MQTT Adapter’s User Guide
.
Publishing Events to the MQTT Adapter
In a similar way you can upload events:
Again, you should now see the telemetry message being logged to console of the downstream application.
Congratulations
You have successfully connected a device to Hono and published sensor data for consumption by an application connected to Hono’s north bound API. The application used the AMQP 1.0 protocol to receive messages regardless of the transport protocol used by the device to publish the data.
What to try next?

Advanced: Sending Commands to a Device
The following example will guide you through an advanced feature of Hono. You will see how an application can send a command to a device and receive a response with the result of processing the command on the device. The communication direction here is exactly the other way round than with telemetry and events.
The following assumes that the steps in the
Prerequisites for the Getting started Guide
and
Registering Devices
sections above have been completed. To simulate the device, you can use the Mosquitto tools again while the Hono Command Line Client simulates the application as before.
Receiving a Command
With the
mosquitto_sub
command you simulate an MQTT device that receives a command. Create a subscription to the command topic in the terminal for the simulated device (don’t forget to set the environment variables
MQTT_ADAPTER_IP
,

and
MY_DEVICE
)
Now that the device is waiting to receive commands, the application can start sending them. Start the Command Line Client in the terminal for the application side (don’t forget to set the environment variables
AMQP_NETWORK_IP
,
MY_TENANT
and
MY_DEVICE
)
Note that this time the profile is
command
instead of
receiver
, which enables a different mode of the Command Line Client.
The client will prompt you to enter the command’s name, the payload to send and the payload’s content type. The example below illustrates how a one-way command to set the volume with a JSON payload is sent to the device.
In the terminal for the simulated device you should see the received command as follows
Sending a Response to a Command
Now that you have sent a one-way command to the device, you may get to know
request/response
commands where the device sends a response to the application. A

command received from an application contains an identifier that is unique to each new command. The device must include this identifier in its response so that the application can correctly correlate the response with the request.
If you send a
request/response
command like this
the application will wait up to 60 seconds for the device’s response.
In the terminal for the simulated device you should see the received command that looks like this
The element between
req
and
setBrightness
is the request identifier that must be included in the response.
You can cancel the command
mosquitto_sub
in the terminal of the device (press the key combination
Ctrl + C
) to reuse the configuration with the environment variables for sending the response. The following example shows how an answer can be sent with MQTT. Note that the actual identifier from the received command must be used.
The
200
at the end of the topic is an HTTP status code that reports the result of processing the command to the application.
If the Command Line Client has successfully received the response in time, it will print it to the console. This looks like this:

If the 60 seconds have already expired, an error message is logged. In this case you can send a new command or restart the Command Line Client with a higher timeout (append
--command.timeoutInSeconds=120
).

Development Resources
Project committers are invited to join the
Incubation mailing list
to discuss issues related to incubation, ask questions of project mentors, and just generally connect with other members of the community involved with projects in the incubation phase.
What is Incubation?
See "
6.2.3 Incubation Phase
" in the Eclipse Development Process.
The web page you were last at belongs to an Eclipse Project that is in the Incubation Phase. Incubation indicates that the Eclipse community is helping this project "learn the ropes" about being a full open source project producing high quality extensible frameworks and exemplary tools. Projects typically stay in the incubation phase for a year or two before graduating to the Mature Phase.
The classification of a project in the Incubation Phase is not a statement about the quality of the project's code - it may be good (in fact, Eclipse Projects are often excellent), it may not - as with all open-source projects, that is for you to decide. Rather, Incubation Phase is more about the project team's progress in practicing the open and public processes necessary to establish the three communities (developers, adopters, and users) around the project.
For more information about Incubation Phase, read the
Eclipse Development Process
and/or the
Guidelines for Incubation Phase
