Road Map
Connect. Command. Control.
Eclipse Hono™ provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol.
Millions of Devices
Hono is designed for connecting large numbers of IoT devices. Its micro service based architecture and use of a reactive programming model allow for scaling out horizontally.
Uniform API
Connect a multitude of different types of devices to your (cloud) back end. Communicate with all of them via the same simple API regardless of the device protocol.
IoT Protocols
Hono supports devices communicating via common IoT protocols like HTTP, MQTT and AMQP out of the box.
Messaging Patterns
Hono provides APIs for important IoT communication patterns:
Telemetry
and
Event
messages can be used by devices to report sensor readings whereas applications can use
Command & Control
to invoke operations on devices.
Secure
Hono is designed for security by default. It supports common authentication mechanisms like username/password and X.509 client certificates to verify a device’s identity and uses transport layer security (TLS) when communicating with devices.
Extensible
Your device uses a custom protocol? Hono provides a simple mechanism to add custom protocol adapters.
