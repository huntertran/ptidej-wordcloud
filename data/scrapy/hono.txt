Road Map
Connect. Command. Control.
Eclipse Hono™ provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol.
Millions of Devices
Hono is designed for connecting large numbers of IoT devices. Its micro service based architecture and use of a reactive programming model allow for scaling out horizontally.
Uniform API
Connect a multitude of different types of devices to your (cloud) back end. Communicate with all of them via the same simple API regardless of the device protocol.
IoT Protocols
Hono supports devices communicating via common IoT protocols like HTTP, MQTT and AMQP out of the box.
Messaging Patterns
Hono provides APIs for important IoT communication patterns:
Telemetry
and
Event
messages can be used by devices to report sensor readings whereas applications can use
Command & Control
to invoke operations on devices.
Secure
Hono is designed for security by default. It supports common authentication mechanisms like username/password and X.509 client certificates to verify a device’s identity and uses transport layer security (TLS) when communicating with devices.
Extensible
Your device uses a custom protocol? Hono provides a simple mechanism to add custom protocol adapters.

when sending messages to the HTTP protocol adapter?
Please check if you have a
consumer connected
and that your consumer is for the same type of message (telemetry or event) that you are sending.
Why do I get the exception
io.vertx.core.VertxException: OpenSSL is not available
during startup of a protocol adapter?
Please check if you have set the property
nativeTlsRequired
in the protocol adapter’s configuration to

Admin Guide
or build your own container images.
Why do I see
ConnectionLimitManager - Connection limit (<VALUE>) exceeded
in the logs of a protocol adapter?
The configured maximum number of concurrent connections is exceeded and the protocol adapter refuses to accept more connections to prevent running out of resources. This limit is either configured on the protocol adapter (
MQTT

AMQP
) or if not set, the protocol adapter determines a reasonable value based on the available resources like memory and CPU.

Why do I see
MemoryBasedConnectionLimitStrategy - Not enough memory
in the logs of a protocol adapter?
The protocol adapter can not allocate enough memory for handle even a small number of connections reliably. Please provide more memory. To try it anyways, configure the maximum number of concurrent connections, as documented in the Admin Guides of the protocol adapter (
MQTT
,
AMQP
).
How do I use client certificates for authentication?
Make sure that you are able to connect to the respective protocol adapter with TLS (see the
Admin Guide
for configuration).
Here
is an article, that provides a complete walk-through guide for all required steps. Additionally you can use and adapt the script for the creation of demo certificates in the Hono repository. More information can be found in the User Guide of the protocol adapter (

Eclipse Hono’s service components are provided by means of pre-built Docker images available from
sandbox
environment at
hono.eclipse.org
. The main purpose of the system is to provide an environment for experimenting with devices and how to connect them to Hono without the need for setting up a local instance.
The sandbox hosts a Hono instance consisting of the same components as described in the
Getting started Guide
. All services are exposed via the same ports as used in the guide.
Take note
The sandbox is intended for
testing purposes only
. Under no circumstances should it be used for any production use case. It is also
not allowed
to register with nor publish any personally identifiable information to any of the sandbox’s services.
You can use the sandbox without revealing who you are or any information about yourself. The APIs of the Device Registry running on the sandbox can be used anonymously for creating tenants, register devices and add credentials. However, data can only be added but
cannot be updated or removed
using the corresponding APIs. This is to prevent others from tampering with your tenants/devices/credentials. In order to minimize the risk of dissemination of data, all tenants, devices and credentials are
deleted periodically
.
We do not collect nor share with third parties any of the data you provide when registering tenants, devices and credentials. We also do not inspect nor collect nor share with third parties any of the data your devices publish to the sandbox.
Play fair!
The sandbox’s computing resources are (quite) limited. The number of devices that can be registered per tenant is therefore limited to 100.
The sandbox will be running the latest Hono release or milestone (if available). However, we may also deploy a more recent nightly build without further notice.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

Road Map
Getting started with Eclipse Hono
This guide will walk you through an interactive example usage scenario of Eclipse Hono. You will learn how devices can use Hono’s protocol adapters to publish telemetry data and events using both HTTP and/or MQTT. You will also see how a downstream application can consume this data using Hono’s north bound API without requiring the application to know anything about the specifics of the communication protocols used by the devices.
Prerequisites for the Getting started Guide
This guide requires several tools to be installed on your computer. During the course of this guide, the devices publishing data will be represented by means of running some command line tools for posting HTTP requests and for publishing MQTT packets.
Curl HTTP Command Line Client
The
curl
command is used in this guide for registering devices with Hono and for simulating a device publishing data using HTTP. On most *nix like systems
curl
will probably already be installed. Otherwise, please refer to the
Curl project page
for installation instructions.
Mosquitto MQTT Command Line Client
The
mosquitto_pub
command is used in this guide for simulating a device publishing data using the MQTT protocol. Please refer to the
YourKit .NET Profiler
.

. These container images can be deployed to popular container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and OpenShift.
The release archive contains all files necessary to deploy Hono to a Kubernetes cluster using the
Helm package manager
.
Eclipse Hono 1.0-M7 Archive
Download and extract the archive and follow the
deployment guide
.
A Java based command line client for consuming telemetry data and events from Hono is available for download as well:
Eclipse Hono 1.0-M7 Command Line Client
The client requires a Java 11 runtime environment to run.
Please refer to the
Admin Guide
for details regarding the command line options that the client supports.
Source Code
The source code can be cloned (using
Git
) or downloaded from the
Eclipse Hono GitHub repository
In order to minimize the risk of collisions of device identities and credentials and to reduce the risk of others
guessing
your identifiers, you are advised to use
non-trivial, hard-to-guess
tenant and device identifiers (e.g. a UUID).
The Apache Artemis instance we use for brokering events is configured with a maximum queue size of 1MB, i.e. you can only buffer up to 1 MB of events (per tenant) without having any consumer connected that actually processes the events. Once that limit is reached, no more events will be accepted by the protocol adapters for the corresponding tenant. In addition to that, events that are not consumed will automatically be removed from the queue(s) after five minutes.
The sandbox exposes its API endpoints on both a TLS secured as well as an unsecured port. The secure ports use a Let’s Encrypt certificate so you should not need to configure a specific trust store on your client in order to interact with them. Please note that when using the unsecured ports, the information you exchange with the sandbox might be exposed to eavesdroppers. We therefore
strongly suggest
that you use the secure ports only, if possible! When using the
Hono client
to access the sandbox’ Telemetry and/or Event APIs, make sure to not set a trust store explicitly but instead set the
tlsEnabled
property to
true
. The command line client binary is available from the
downloads page
and can be used to consume telemetry/event messages from the sandbox as below:
Note that only the
receiver
profile is activated but not the
ssl
profile.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

for installation instructions, if you do not have it installed already.
NB
The installation of the Mosquitto command line client is optional. If you do not install it then you will not be able to simulate an MQTT based device but otherwise will be able to get the same results described in this guide.
Hono Command Line Client
The Hono command line client is used in this guide for simulating an application that consumes telemetry data and events published by devices. The client is available from
Hono’s download page
. Note that running the command line client requires a Java 11 runtime environment being installed locally.
Hono Sandbox
The most important prerequisite is, of course, a Hono instance that you can work with.
The most straightforward option to use for this guide is the
Hono Sandbox
which is running on infrastructure provided by the Eclipse Foundation and which is publicly accessible from the internet.
Using the Sandbox, there is no need to set up your own Hono instance locally. However, it requires several non-standard ports being accessible from your computer which may not be the case, e.g. if you are behind a firewall restricting internet access to a few standard ports only.
You can verify if you can access the relevant ports of the Sandbox by running the following command and comparing the output:
If you get output like this
you can use the Sandbox. Run the following commands to set some environment variables which will be used during the guide
and then proceed to the
Overview of Hono Components
.
However, if the
curl
command yielded different output, you will need to set up Hono locally as described in the next section.
. The
Building from Source
guide provides instructions on how to build Hono locally.

Setting up a local Hono Instance
In case you cannot access the Hono Sandbox as described above, you will need to set up an instance of Hono running on your local computer. For evaluation purposes a single node
Minikube
cluster is sufficient to deploy Hono to.
Please refer to the
installation instructions
for setting up a local Minikube cluster, then
follow the
Deployment Guide
in order to install Hono to your local Minikube cluster.
Once Hono has been deployed to your local cluster, run the following commands to set some environment variables which will be used during the guide
Verify the last step with
If this does not print an IP address, check that

In the example scenario used in the remainder of this guide, the devices will connect to the HTTP and MQTT adapters in order to publish telemetry data and events. The devices will be authenticated using information stored in the Device Registry. The data is then forwarded downstream to the example application via the AMQP Messaging Network.
Registering Devices
When a device tries to connect to one of Hono’s protocol adapters, the protocol adapter first tries to authenticate the device using information kept in the Device Registry. The information maintained in the registry includes the
tenant
(a logical scope) that the device belongs to, the device’s unique
identity
within the tenant and the
credentials
used by the device for authentication.
Before a device can connect to Hono and publish any data, the corresponding information needs to be added to the Device Registry.
Creating a new Tenant
Register a tenant using Hono’s Device Registry’s management HTTP API (a random tenant identifier will be generated):
Random tenant ID value
You will receive a randomly generated tenantId value. It will probably be different than the value given in this example. Make sure to export it to an environment variable to make the following steps easier:
Adding a Device to the Tenant
Register a device using Hono’s Device Registry’s management HTTP API (a random device identifier will be assigned):
Random device ID value
You will receive a randomly generated deviceId value. It will probably be different than the value given in this example. Make sure to export it to an environment variable to make the following steps easier:
Setting a Password for the Device

Otherwise, if you are using a local Minikube cluster:
The client can then be started from the command line as follows (make sure to replace

Publishing Telemetry Data to the HTTP Adapter
Now that the downstream application is running, devices can start publishing telemetry data and events using Hono’s protocol adapters. First, you will simulate a device publishing data to Hono using the HTTP protocol. Go back to the original terminal and run:
If you have started the downstream application as described above, you should now see the telemetry message being logged to the application’s console in the other terminal. The output should look something like this:
You can publish more data simply by re-running the
curl
command above with arbitrary payload.

When you invoke the command above for the first time, you may get the following response:
This is because the first request to publish data for a given tenant is used as the trigger to establish a tenant specific sender link with the AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network to forward the data over. However, the HTTP adapter may not receive credits quickly enough for the request to be served immediately. You can simply ignore this response and re-submit the command.
If you haven’t started the application you will always get
503 Resource Unavailable
responses because Hono does not accept any telemetry data from devices if there aren’t any consumers connected that are interested in the data. The reason for this is that Hono
never
persists Telemetry data and thus it doesn’t make any sense to accept and process telemetry data if there is no consumer to deliver it to.
The HTTP Adapter also supports publishing telemetry messages using
at least once
delivery semantics. For information on how that works and additional examples for interacting with Hono via HTTP, please refer to the
HTTP Adapter’s User Guide
.
Publishing Events to the HTTP Adapter
In a similar way you can upload events:
Again, you should see the event being logged to the console of the downstream application.
Publishing Telemetry Data to the MQTT Adapter
Devices can also publish data to Hono using the MQTT protocol. If you have installed the
mosquitto_pub
command line client, you can run the following command to publish arbitrary telemetry data to Hono’s MQTT adapter using QoS 0:
Again, you should now see the telemetry message being logged to console of the downstream application.
The MQTT Adapter also supports publishing telemetry messages using QoS 1. For information on how that works and additional examples for interacting with Hono via MQTT, please refer to the
MQTT Adapter’s User Guide

Congratulations
You have successfully connected a device to Hono and published sensor data for consumption by an application connected to Hono’s north bound API. The application used the AMQP 1.0 protocol to receive messages regardless of the transport protocol used by the device to publish the data.
What to try next?
Continue with the next sections to learn how applications can send commands to devices by means of the
Command & Control API
.
Take a look at some of the metrics collected by Hono’s components by opening the Hono dashboard. On the Sandbox server the dashboard is available at
https://hono.eclipse.org:3000
. When running a local Minikube cluster, please refer to
Opening the Dashboard
for instructions.
Check out the
User Guides
to explore more options for devices to connect to Hono using different transport protocols.

Device Registry’s HTTP API

Advanced: Sending Commands to a Device
The following example will guide you through an advanced feature of Hono. You will see how an application can send a command to a device and receive a response with the result of processing the command on the device. The communication direction here is exactly the other way round than with telemetry and events.

The following assumes that the steps in the
Prerequisites for the Getting started Guide
and
Registering Devices
sections above have been completed. To simulate the device, you can use the Mosquitto tools again while the Hono Command Line Client simulates the application as before.
Receiving a Command
With the
mosquitto_sub
command you simulate an MQTT device that receives a command. Create a subscription to the command topic in the terminal for the simulated device (don’t forget to set the environment variables
MQTT_ADAPTER_IP
,
MY_TENANT
and
MY_DEVICE
)
Now that the device is waiting to receive commands, the application can start sending them. Start the Command Line Client in the terminal for the application side (don’t forget to set the environment variables
AMQP_NETWORK_IP
,
MY_TENANT
and
MY_DEVICE

)
Note that this time the profile is
command
instead of
receiver
, which enables a different mode of the Command Line Client.
The client will prompt you to enter the command’s name, the payload to send and the payload’s content type. The example below illustrates how a one-way command to set the volume with a JSON payload is sent to the device.
In the terminal for the simulated device you should see the received command as follows
Sending a Response to a Command
Now that you have sent a one-way command to the device, you may get to know
request/response
commands where the device sends a response to the application. A
request/response
command received from an application contains an identifier that is unique to each new command. The device must include this identifier in its response so that the application can correctly correlate the response with the request.
If you send a
request/response
command like this
the application will wait up to 60 seconds for the device’s response.
In the terminal for the simulated device you should see the received command that looks like this
The element between
req
and
setBrightness
is the request identifier that must be included in the response.
You can cancel the command
mosquitto_sub
in the terminal of the device (press the key combination
Ctrl + C
) to reuse the configuration with the environment variables for sending the response. The following example shows how an answer can be sent with MQTT. Note that the actual identifier from the received command must be used.
The
200
at the end of the topic is an HTTP status code that reports the result of processing the command to the application.
If the Command Line Client has successfully received the response in time, it will print it to the console. This looks like this:
If the 60 seconds have already expired, an error message is logged. In this case you can send a new command or restart the Command Line Client with a higher timeout (append
--command.timeoutInSeconds=120
).
Congratulations. Now you have successfully sent commands to a device and responded to them. For more information on Command & Control refer to
Commands using HTTP
and
Commands using MQTT
. The
Command and Control Concepts
page contains sequence diagrams that explain this in more detail.

Development Resources
Project committers are invited to join the
Incubation mailing list
to discuss issues related to incubation, ask questions of project mentors, and just generally connect with other members of the community involved with projects in the incubation phase.
What is Incubation?
See "
6.2.3 Incubation Phase
" in the Eclipse Development Process.
The web page you were last at belongs to an Eclipse Project that is in the Incubation Phase. Incubation indicates that the Eclipse community is helping this project "learn the ropes" about being a full open source project producing high quality extensible frameworks and exemplary tools. Projects typically stay in the incubation phase for a year or two before graduating to the Mature Phase.
The classification of a project in the Incubation Phase is not a statement about the quality of the project's code - it may be good (in fact, Eclipse Projects are often excellent), it may not - as with all open-source projects, that is for you to decide. Rather, Incubation Phase is more about the project team's progress in practicing the open and public processes necessary to establish the three communities (developers, adopters, and users) around the project.
For more information about Incubation Phase, read the
Eclipse Development Process
and/or the
Guidelines for Incubation Phase
