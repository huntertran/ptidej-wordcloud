Whiskers is an
OGC SensorThings API
framework consisting of a JavaScript client and a light-weight server for IoT gateways (e.g., Raspberry Pi). The SensorThings API is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard that allows IoT (Internet of Things) devices and their data to be connected; a major goal is to foster a healthy and open IoT ecosystem, as opposed to one dominated by proprietary information silos.
JavaScript is ubiquitous, powering client-side web applications and server-side services alike. The availability of an open source client library is an important step in the adoption of the OGC SensorThings standard, as it makes development quicker and easier.
In addition the a client library, Whiskers will also have a SensorThings server module for IoT gateways, such as Raspberry Pi. Developers will be able to deploy and configure IoT gateways, make them SensorThings API-compliant, and connect with spatial data servers around the world that implement the full array of
OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards
.
Whiskers aims to make SensorThings development easy for the large and growing world of IoT developers.

Background:
The Internet of Things (IoT) needs no introduction: it is a widely-held view that billions of devices will be part of the Internet of Things in just a few short years. Yet, while this explosion of devices represents boundless opportunity for innovation, this ascendancy also presents daunting challenges such as fragmentation, vendor lock-in and the proliferation of information silos. The OGC (
Open Geospatial Consortium
)
SensorThings API
is an OGC standard that allows IoT devices and their data to be connected in an easy-to-use and open way. The wide adoption of the SensorThings API would contribute to an IoT ecosystem that is healthy and interconnected, rather than one that is proprietary, incompatible and fragmented.
Scope:
Whiskers is an OGC SensorThings API framework consisting of a JavaScript client and a light-weight server for IoT gateways. As the OGC SensorThings API standard specification continues to evolve, Whiskers will evolve with it.

Whiskers aims to make SensorThings development easy for the large and growing world of IoT developers.
Why Here?:
The Eclipse Foundation is home to a large and growing number of IoT and geospatial projects (e.g., LocationTech), and is widely recognized for its good governance. Being a part of the Eclipse Community will bring Whiskers visibility, credibility and access to some of the most experienced minds in the open source world.
Initial Contribution:
There will be no initial contribution. The project will start from scratch. We expect to use some existing Eclipse IoT libraries, such as Paho, Californium, and Kura.
Legal Issues:
We are not aware of any legal issues. Whiskers will be an implementation of an OGC standard. There is no legal issues for the API. We are starting the code base from scratch, so there will be no potential source code license issues.
Licenses:
Eclipse Distribution License 1.0 (BSD)
Eclipse Public License 1.0
Project Scheduling:
Whiskers aims to have an initial contribution ready by the end of Q2 2016.
Future Work:
Going forward, Whiskers will evolve along with the SensorThings API standard specification. The Sensing Profile of SensorThings (Part I) has been developed, and the Tasking Profile (Part II) is expected to be available in the upcoming months. The SensorThings Rules Engine (Part III) is also under development within OGC.

Without any code and without being an emanation of an existing Eclipse projet it's hard to evaluate the viability of this project.
You have some code available somewhere?

Using Eclipse Whiskers
Eclipse Whiskers is still in an early development stage, so some details may change as we stabilize the API before version 1.0.
Using with Node.js
This library can be used with the Node.js version of CommonJS to include all the library sub-modules as a single namespaced object. First add eclipse-whiskers as a dependency from GitHub.
A module hosted by NPM will be coming at a later date. Instead of referencing the master branch, this command forces a specific commit to be used, which is highly recommended when referencing a Git repository as a new commit may come in that adds an unexpected behaviour. In the future this will be handled with the NPM module and by using semantic versioning.
Once Eclipse Whiskers is added to your
node_modules
directory, it can be used in your Node application:
At the moment, the following classes will be available:

Generic
Location

statements and ES2015 modules. These are not compatible with most browsers and requiring the files in an HTML script tag will not work.
If you are using Browserify or Webpack in your web application, you could use that to bundle Eclipse Whiskers into your application by requiring it in your code:
This will bundle a self-contained version of Eclipse Whiskers
with
jQuery and Q inside. You will also have to run a ES2015 transpiler such as Babel to convert the code to be supported in most web browsers.
Instead
, I recommend you use the web version of Eclipse Whiskers that is pre-compiled for ES5 (most semi-recent web browsers support ES5). This version does not include jQuery and Q inside, those must be available in the global namespace. The file is contained in
dist/eclipse-whiskers.js
and can be used in a script tag:
Note that jQuery and Q must be included before Eclipse Whiskers. A global variable
EclipseWhiskers
will be made available that provides access to the API. The API documentation in

goes into more detail on its usage.
Note that Eclipse Whiskers has not been tested with Q version 2.0 or newer, nor with jQuery version 3.0 or newer.
Versioning
Whiskers aims to follow
Semantic Versioning
. This means you can expect the library to be stable on Major version numbers, with only backwards-compatible changes on Minor and Patch version number changes. An exception is made for versions before 1.0.0, where the API is unstable while our development team focuses on a unified API — that means releases before 1.0.0 may introduce breaking changes between Minor versions.
Issues
You can submit issues through GitHub, through Eclipse Bugzilla, or on the mailing list.

Building Web Versions
The web compatible version in
dist/eclipse-whiskers.js
can be built from the source in
lib
using Browserify. First install the development dependencies for Eclipse Whiskers:
Then use Browserify to convert the require statements into globals (see
browserify-shim
section in
package.json
for that configuration) and to convert from ES2015 to ES5 using
babelify
.
The command is also ran through
exorcist
, which creates a separate JavaScript source map file. Having a source map file can make debugging Whiskers easier in the web browser, as the source will be displayed without minification.
This web version code should be updated regularly, and must be updated for any versioned release of Eclipse Whiskers.
If any ES2016 or ES next features are used in the source, then preset packages for babelify will need to be added — please see the

for instructions.
Why use browserify-shim?
Without it, Browserify will go ahead and include a copy of jQuery and Q inside the output file. This is nice, but if you already have jQuery or Q included in your application then you have two copies, which is a waste of bandwidth. So instead we use browserify-shim to replace those require statements with references to global variables.
An exception can be made though if you are using versions of jQuery or Q that are incompatible with Eclipse Whiskers, and in that case it would be better to not use the web version and to use Browserify and Babel on the Node.js version of Eclipse Whiskers instead.

Eclipse Whiskers for Arduino
Whiskers for Arduino is a library for connecting Arduino devices to
OGC SensorThings API
. The SensorThings API is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard that allows IoT (Internet of Things) devices and their data to be connected; a major goal is to foster a healthy and open IoT ecosystem, as opposed to one dominated by proprietary information silos.
Thanks to the financial support of Natural Resources Canada

Using Eclipse Whiskers for Ardunio
Eclipse Whiskers for Arduino is using one other Arduino library for MQTT connections:
PubSubClient
Note that you need to add this library for Whiskers for Arduino to work.
The library has methods for connecting to a SensorThings server as well as SensorThings MQTT broker. After connecting to the server, you can use the library method to create SensorThings entities and start uploading Observations.
Example folder contains example usage of the library. The example code provided is for
Linkit One
and for internet connection it is using
MediaTek LWiFi

Arduino library.
There are two main approach to use the library:
You create all the required entities, and use the device only for sending Observations.
The device is plug-and-play which means it creates all the required entities and then send Observations.
In following two Sections, we explain the steps for using the library for each of these approaches.
Plug-and-Play Device
Connect your device to internet. SensorThings library accepts a "Client" connected to internet as one of the parameters.
Create a SensorThings instance by passing the "Client", SensorThings server address, port used for HTTP requests, SensorThings MQTT broker address, and port used for MQTT.
Use createEntities method of the SensorThings instance to create all the required entities. The parameters required for this method are Thing description, Datastream description, unitOfMeasurement name, Sensor description and ObservedProperty description. This method is simplified for device maker and because of that the library generate all the other entity properties based on these parameters. User can update these properties at any time with sending HTTP request to the SensorThings server.
Use sendObservation method of the SensorThings instance to send the Observations. The parameters are result, latitude, and longitude. If your device is not moving, after the first sendObservation request, you can use sendObservation only with result parameter.
Sending Observations only
Create Thing, Location, Datastream, Sensor, and ObservedProperty in the SensorThings server. Keep note of the @iot.id for the Datastream that you created.
Connect your device to internet. SensorThings library accepts a "Client" connected to internet as one of the parameters.
Create a SensorThings instance by passing the "Client", SensorThings MQTT broker address, port used for MQTT, and @iot.id for Datastream.
Use sendObservation method of the SensorThings instance with result parameter to send the Observations.

Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process
) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section.
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
The Internet of Things (IoT) needs no introduction: it is a widely-held view that billions of devices will be part of the Internet of Things in just a few short years. Yet, while this explosion of devices represents boundless opportunity for innovation, this ascendancy also presents daunting challenges such as fragmentation, vendor lock-in and the proliferation of information silos. The OGC (
Open Geospatial Consortium
)
SensorThings API
is an OGC standard that allows IoT devices and their data to be connected in an easy-to-use and open way. The wide adoption of the SensorThings API would contribute to an IoT ecosystem that is healthy and interconnected, rather than one that is proprietary, incompatible and fragmented.
Scope:
Whiskers is an OGC SensorThings API framework consisting of a JavaScript client and a light-weight server for IoT gateways. As the OGC SensorThings API standard specification continues to evolve, Whiskers will evolve with it.

framework consisting of a JavaScript client and a light-weight server for IoT gateways (e.g., Raspberry Pi). The SensorThings API is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard that allows IoT (Internet of Things) devices and their data to be connected; a major goal is to foster a healthy and open IoT ecosystem, as opposed to one dominated by proprietary information silos.
JavaScript is ubiquitous, powering client-side web applications and server-side services alike. The availability of an open source client library is an important step in the adoption of the OGC SensorThings standard, as it makes development quicker and easier.
In addition the a client library, Whiskers will also have a SensorThings server module for IoT gateways, such as Raspberry Pi. Developers will be able to deploy and configure IoT gateways, make them SensorThings API-compliant, and connect with spatial data servers around the world that implement the full array of
OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards
.
Whiskers aims to make SensorThings development easy for the large and growing world of IoT developers.
Why Here?:
The Eclipse Foundation is home to a large and growing number of IoT and geospatial projects (e.g., LocationTech), and is widely recognized for its good governance. Being a part of the Eclipse Community will bring Whiskers visibility, credibility and access to some of the most experienced minds in the open source world.
Licenses:
Eclipse Distribution License 1.0 (BSD)
Eclipse Public License 1.0
Legal Issues:
We are not aware of any legal issues. Whiskers will be an implementation of an OGC standard. There is no legal issues for the API. We are starting the code base from scratch, so there will be no potential source code license issues.
Project Scheduling:
Whiskers aims to have an initial contribution ready by the end of Q2 2016.
Future Work:
Going forward, Whiskers will evolve along with the SensorThings API standard specification. The Sensing Profile of SensorThings (Part I) has been developed, and the Tasking Profile (Part II) is expected to be available in the upcoming months. The SensorThings Rules Engine (Part III) is also under development within OGC.
