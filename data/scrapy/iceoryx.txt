In domains like automotive, robotics or gaming, a huge amount of data must be transferred between different parts of the system. If these parts are actually different processes on a POSIX based operating system like Linux, this huge amount of data has to be transferred via an inter-process-communication (IPC) mechanism.
The mechanisms provided by the operating system, like message queues, normally require to copy the data and are subject to context switches between user and kernel space. In fact, it is often not only one but many copies of the transferred data between the sender and the receiver. If it comes to GBytes/s data exchange rates, avoiding these copies becomes a crucial factor.
iceoryx is a middleware with a zero-copy shared memory approach which is optimized for the huge data inter-process-communication.

Status message
This proposal has been approved and the
Eclipse iceoryx
project has been created.
Eclipse iceoryx
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process
) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section.
Parent Project:
Eclipse Technology
Background:
iceoryx is an inter-process communication (IPC) middleware for POSIX based operating systems. It features shared memory capabilities which allow a true zero-copy data transfer.
Originating from the automotive domain, it is crucial to transfer a huge amount of data between multiple processes to realize driver assistance systems or automated driving applications. Moreover, the same efficient communication mechanism can be applied to a broader range of use cases, e.g. in the field of robotics or game development.
Scope:
Eclipse iceoryx provides algorithms and libraries for shared memory communication on POSIX operating systems.
Description:
In domains like automotive, robotics or gaming, a huge amount of data must be transferred between different parts of the system. If these parts are actually different processes on a POSIX based operating system like Linux, this huge amount of data has to be transferred via an inter-process-communication (IPC) mechanism.
The mechanisms provided by the operating system, like message queues, normally require to copy the data and are subject to context switches between user and kernel space. In fact, it is often not only one but many copies of the transferred data between the sender and the receiver. If it comes to GBytes/s data exchange rates, avoiding these copies becomes a crucial factor.
iceoryx is a middleware with a zero-copy shared memory approach which is optimized for the huge data inter-process-communication.
Why Here?:
The OpenADx working group is currently under preparation for becoming an official Eclipse WG. OpenADx information are currently hosted at the Eclipse Wiki.
Licenses:
Apache License, Version 2.0
Legal Issues:
There are no known legal issues.
Project Scheduling:
Initial contribution is planned for end of October 2019
Future Work:
This project is work in progress. New features will be added, also in exchange with feedback coming from the community. The goal is to have a code base that is production ready.

Creation Review | projects.eclipse.org
ROS will be one of the potential partners/community
We believe that there will be some interest in the OpenADx community.

Initial Contribution:
We plan to do the first contribution end of October 2019.

iceoryx - true zero-copy inter-process-communication
Introduction
Great that you've made it to this little Eclipse project! Let's get you started by providing a quick background tour, introducing the project scope and all you need for installation and a first running example.
So first off: What is iceoryx?

iceoryx is an inter-process-communication (IPC) middleware for various operating systems (currently we support Linux, MacOS and QNX). It has its origins in the automotive industry, where large amounts of data have to be transferred between different processes when it comes to driver assistance or automated driving systems. However, the efficient communication mechanisms can also be applied to a wider range of use cases, e.g. in the field of robotics or game development.
iceoryx uses a true zero-copy, shared memory approach that allows to transfer data from publishers to subscribers without a single copy. This ensures data transmissions with constant latency, regardless of the size of the payload. For more information have a look at the
1000 words iceoryx introduction
You're right, middleware is a cluttered term and can somehow be all or nothing, so let's talk about the
goals and non-goals
of iceoryx.
It's all about the API?!
Don't get too frighten of the API when strolling through the codebase. Think of iceoryx's API as a "plumbing" one ("plumbing" as defined in Git, which means low-level). We're not using the "plumbing" API ourselves, but instead a typed API. The normal use case is that iceoryx is integrated as high-performance IPC transport layer in a bigger framework with additional API layers. An example for such a "porcelain" API would be
