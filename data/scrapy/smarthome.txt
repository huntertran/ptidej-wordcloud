A Flexible Framework for the Smart Home
Open Source.
For an Open Future.
Our Vision
Smart Home adoption will only gain momentum if the different devices can be connected into over-arching use cases, but currently the market for Smart Home systems and IoT gadgets is heavily fragmented. While there are a couple of companies big enough to establish their own proprietary ecosystems, we believe that Open Source is the only viable option to provide truly open platforms without vendor lock-ins.
Accept the Diversity
While there are approaches of defining common communication protocols that all devices and systems must support in order to communicate with each other, the Eclipse SmartHome™ project accepts the fact that there is a vast variety of communication mechanisms, which all have their right to exist. Eclipse SmartHome™ therefore serves as an abstraction and translation framework that makes interaction possible across system and protocol boundaries.
Made for Embedded
The framework is designed to run on embedded devices, such as a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBone Black or an Intel Edison. It requires a Java 8 compliant JVM and an OSGi (4.2+) framework, such as Eclipse Equinox™.
