Introduction
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is flexible.
It is not an out of the box solution, but a set of tools that can be combined in many different ways. It provides development libraries, interface applications, mass configuration tools, front-end and back-end applications.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is ready to rock.
It is used 24/7 in several installations around this world.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is supported.
So if you prefer a fully supported, out of the box instead of a "build it yourself" solution you can contact IBH SYSTEMS GmbH and let us do the job. If you like, you will still get the source code that was developed specially for you.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ needs you.
Writing source code, writing documentation, fixing bugs or providing fresh input. Anything is welcome.

Eclipse Foundation Website Privacy Policy
May 24, 2018
The Eclipse Foundation, Inc. ("Eclipse Foundation", "Us" or "We") is a member-supported not-for-profit foundation which acts as the steward of our open source projects, community, and ecosystem. We are committed to our community members’ rights to privacy. We promise to share transparently all aspects of how Eclipse Foundation projects and websites work in regards to privacy, terms, and personal data, and We are in full support of efforts to ensure your protection online. We only collect your personal data with your consent, and collect only as much as We need to provide you the service you request. For example, We need your personal data to register you to one of our conferences. Each time We collect additional personal data from you We will explain what We collect, why We need it, how We use it, how long We keep it, and how We protect it.
You can withdraw consent anytime. We will respect your wishes.
Personal Information on Eclipse Foundation Websites
As a platform for open source innovation and collaboration, personal information on all Eclipse Foundation websites is either meant to be shared, for example records of your contributions to our open source projects, or protected, such as your name and email address when you subscribe to our newsletter.
Any personal data you share with Us, We protect according to this Privacy policy.
Individual Access to Personal Information
We will respond within 30 days to your requests to have access to your personal information collected by Us. We will promptly correct inaccuracies, as the case may be, and We will delete it and/or anonymize it upon your request. Please contact
privacy@eclipse.org
to make such a request.
Information Security and Quality
We protect the integrity of your personal information with appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as using encryption for transmission of certain forms of information, to help keep it secure, accurate, current, and complete.
Your personal information may be stored in Canada, the European Union and the United States, always with our same high security standards.
One of the primary purposes of the Eclipse Foundation and its websites is to enable collaborative open source software development. Doing so necessarily requires Us to maintain records of authorship related to all contributions. Any personally identifiable information collected by virtue of your contributions will be publicly available on the Internet in unencrypted form and without access restriction.
We also offer services to our community which provide the ability for users of Eclipse software to store data on Eclipse Foundation servers through services including, but not limited to, the User Storage Service and the Automated Error Reporting Initiative. Any data stored through these services will be publicly available on the Internet in unencrypted form and without access restriction. Therefore, you should not use these services to store passwords, any personally identifiable information, any confidential business information, or anything else that you do not want to be generally and publicly available.
Clickstream Data and Cookies
We sometimes collect anonymous information from visits and contributions to Eclipse Foundation websites to help provide better service. For example, We keep track of the domains from which people visit and We also measure visitor activity on Eclipse Foundation websites, but in ways that keep the information anonymous. This anonymous information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." We may use and aggregate this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help Us tailor our websites to better serve Eclipse participants.

This document provides a quick pictorial overview of the due diligence process.
Third Party Dependencies:
This document contains the guidelines for the review of third-party dependencies.
Committer Guidelines:
This document outlines the issues to be aware of and the processes one should follow when working as a committer on Eclipse.org projects. A committer is a person that has been granted commit rights to systems on the Eclipse.org servers such as git repositories, web pages, download servers, mailing lists and so forth.
Contribution Questionnaire:
A Contribution Questionnaires (CQ) is the main interface between Eclipse committers and the Intellectual Property Management Team. Prior to committing a significant contribution of content to an Eclipse Foundation project, the committer must fill out this questionnaire and submit it to the Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) for approval. In addition to the EMO, the relevant PMC must also provide a technical review and approval of the contribution. Follow the link to find out more about what we mean by "significant contribution". Bug fixes or minor enhancements do not require PMC or EMO approval.
"About" Templates:
This provides templates for the "about.html" ("About") files used to describe EPL-licensed content.
Default Copyright and License Notice:
The standard copyright and license notice should appear in all source files where possible. Variations on this notice may be required (for example where a license other than the EPL governs the use of the file).
IP Logs:
An IP Log is a record of the intellectual property contributions to a project. This includes such as a list of all committers, past and present, that have worked on the code and (especially) those who have made contributions to the current code base.
New Committer Process:
The process for project leads and PMC members to add additional committers to an existing project.

A set of out-of-the-box drivers modules/device adapters
A monitoring system, evaluating gathered data, storing generated events
A data archive, storing gathered data
Create a reference implementation
A graphical user interface for gathered data, alarms & events from the monitoring system, archived value data
A system to configure and document the system
Not part of the this project are:
An embedded systems platform (like PLCs or embedded control systems)
A communication system that transports arbitrary complex data structures
Description
Definition from wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA
SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is a type of industrial control system (ICS). Industrial control systems are computer controlled systems that monitor and control industrial processes that exist in the physical world. SCADA systems historically distinguish themselves from other ICS systems by being large scale processes that can include multiple sites, and large distances.
Simply speaking the primary target of Eclipse SCADA is a way to connect different industrial devices to a common communication system and post-process as well as visualize the data to operating personnel.

Since this scheme will also work with non-industrial devices and devices do become more complex and tend to become software solutions themselves the term “device” should be more considered as an “other system”.
The idea of a SCADA system is to provide mostly scalar values instead of complex data structures. Where necessary data structures are split up into multiple scalar values. This is done in order to process the data more quickly and allow common processing of data.
For example a meteo station is providing current weather information. It can provide temperature and solar radiation. These are two floating point values which are processed independently. Still the same alarming schema (high level alarm) can be applied to both values. The values can both be assigned a quality/alarm information (alarm state) which can then be shown using the same user interface element and the same visualization scheme (alarm is displayed with red background). This way many different scalar values can be processed exactly the same way.
Why Eclipse?
First of all this project uses several Eclipse technologies like OSGi, RCP, EMF and a few more. This is the reason why the existing openSCADA project is technologically already quite close to the Eclipse project set. Also a lot of code already exists which could be used by other projects in the Eclipse Foundation.

We hope that bringing openSCADA into Eclipse as Eclipse SCADA will increase the visibility of the open source SCADA system and attract other contributors and companies to an open source SCADA solution. An open source SCADA communication stack could be used by system integrators and device manufactures to provide a default way of communicating with devices, in an open source ecosystem. Due to the connected nature of a SCADA system it is important to have an open connection infrastructure. As ibh SYSTEMS GmbH we are not in the position to provide an industry standard way, as an Eclipse project it would be possible to set a standard together with other industrial projects in that area. We also do not begin from scratch, since we already have a working solution.
We as ibh SYSTEMS GmbH of course hope to assist in realizing such solutions and enhance Eclipse SCADA in future projects as we did with openSCADA up to now. Yet the Eclipse Foundation provides a much broader audience.
openSCADA already has a small community and several users. It has an open communication channel (google group), a wiki and bug tracker at Atlassian, three publicly accessible git repositories. This is why we don't see any additional value in migrating to Eclipse Labs.
Initial Contribution
As base for Eclipse SCADA we want to use the existing openSCADA project source code. The code is currently hosted by ibh SYSTEMS GmbH. The copyright owners are the proposed committers which already worked as freelancer on the project as well the companies TH4 SYSTEMS GmbH (formerly inavare GmbH) and ibh SYSTEMS GmbH.
The source code was originally managed in several subversion repositories which were converted to git repositories some time ago. The openSCADA project itself is grouped into different sub-projects in order to modularize it.
External
Contains all external libraries (except j-interop). This project will not be contributed. Eclipse Orbit will be used instead.
Aurora
Holds non-user interface utility components
Utgard
The OPC driver implementation, based on j-interop
Oxygen
Implementations of some protocols, mostly openSCADA internal
Atlantis
Non-user interface components of the openSCADA system. Including driver modules, alarming, archiving.
Orilla
User interface components of the openSCADA system.
Infinity
An SWT based time series chart widget.
Dakara
The Draw2D based vector graphics visualization
Othala
An Eclipse RCP project build which provides the
OSTC
an admin/test client for use with openSCADA.
Orion
Some additional user interface components used within the Eclipse IDE
Tau'ri
Some example projects and setups for demoing openSCADA
Contrib
Some source code that can be used with openSCADA but does not fit into the release version of openSCADA due to the lack of use, testing or license issues.
The initial contribution of Eclipse SCADA would be the openSCADA Git repositories which are currently replicated to:
http://git.openscada.org
https://bitbucket.org/ctron
https://github.com/ctron
The initial components we want to contribute are:
Aurora
Oxgyen
Utgard (as the j-interop dependencies are resolved)
Atlantis
Orilla
Infinity
Othala
Dakara
Deploy
Orion
Note that the
Orion
component will renamed to avoid confusion with the Eclipse Orion project.

Legal Issues
The openSCADA project, which will be the source base for Eclipse SCADA, is developed by the named contributors (see below). At the moment the license is LGPLv3, but all contributors have agreed to change the license to the EPL license for contributing the project openSCADA to the Eclipse Foundation.
There however several external libraries which openSCADA requires at the moment which are not EPL. In order to reduce issues with the upcoming contribution to Eclipse, dependencies were removed or replaced with versions from the Eclipse Orbit repository. The plan is to complete this transition for all required libraries for the openSCADA release 1.2, which is planned to be the initial version contributed to Eclipse (also see below).
One special case remaining is the library
j-interop
. This library and its dependencies are required for one important driver (OPC driver) of the openSCADA System. Although the system can work without this driver module, it is a very useful component. Also is this library used by the Eclipse Project
Hudson
for the DCOM/Windows Slave plugin. Possible solutions are: either to remove the module from Eclipse SCADA and leave it with the openSCADA
contrib
repository, or to import j-interop (if not already done) into the Eclipse Foundation in some way. Since the author of the j-interop library (Vikram Roopchand) and us worked together in the past and also contributed to the library, it should be an interesting contribution to Eclipse in any way. j-interop includes some code from other libraries (iWombat and GNU Crypto) with incompatible licensing, but this is easily resolvable with a custom implementation and the use of bouncycastle (which is licensed under a variant of the MIT X11 License,
http://www.bouncycastle.org/licence.html
).

Project Scheduling
The project will be started by contributing the openSCADA source code to the Eclipse Foundation. At the moment openSCADA is released as version 1.1 and the version 1.2 is planned withing the next view months. The idea is to clean up some parts and dependencies from 1.1 to 1.2 before contributing version 1.2 to the Eclipse Foundation.

Project committers are invited to join the
Incubation mailing list
to discuss issues related to incubation, ask questions of project mentors, and just generally connect with other members of the community involved with projects in the incubation phase.
What is Incubation?
See "
6.2.3 Incubation Phase
" in the Eclipse Development Process.
The web page you were last at belongs to an Eclipse Project that is in the Incubation Phase. Incubation indicates that the Eclipse community is helping this project "learn the ropes" about being a full open source project producing high quality extensible frameworks and exemplary tools. Projects typically stay in the incubation phase for a year or two before graduating to the Mature Phase.
The classification of a project in the Incubation Phase is not a statement about the quality of the project's code - it may be good (in fact, Eclipse Projects are often excellent), it may not - as with all open-source projects, that is for you to decide. Rather, Incubation Phase is more about the project team's progress in practicing the open and public processes necessary to establish the three communities (developers, adopters, and users) around the project.
For more information about Incubation Phase, read the
Eclipse Development Process
and/or the
Guidelines for Incubation Phase
