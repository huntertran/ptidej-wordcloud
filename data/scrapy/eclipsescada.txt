Introduction
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is flexible.
It is not an out of the box solution, but a set of tools that can be combined in many different ways. It provides development libraries, interface applications, mass configuration tools, front-end and back-end applications.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is ready to rock.
It is used 24/7 in several installations around this world.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is supported.
So if you prefer a fully supported, out of the box instead of a "build it yourself" solution you can contact IBH SYSTEMS GmbH and let us do the job. If you like, you will still get the source code that was developed specially for you.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ needs you.
Writing source code, writing documentation, fixing bugs or providing fresh input. Anything is welcome.
