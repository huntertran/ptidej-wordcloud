Apache Camel
Apache Camel is a powerful, open-source integration framework based on prevalent
Enterprise Integration Patterns with powerful bean integration.
Introduction
Camel enables the creation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns to implement routing
and mediation rules in either a Java-based Domain Specific Language (or Fluent API),
via Spring or Blueprint based Xml Configuration files, or via the Scala DSL.
That means you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE whether
in your Java, Scala, or XML editor.
Apache Camel uses URIs to enable easier integration with all kinds of
transport or messaging model including HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA
or CXF together with working with pluggable Data Format options.
Apache Camel is a small library that has minimal dependencies for easy embedding
in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work with the same API regardless of the
transport type, making it possible to interact with all the components provided out-of-the-box,
with a good understanding of the API.
Apache Camel has powerful Bean Binding and integrated seamlessly with
popular frameworks such as Spring, CDI, and Blueprint.
Apache Camel has extensive testing support allowing you to easily
unit test your routes.
Components
Apache Camel comes alongside several artifacts with components, data formats, languages, and kinds.
The up to date list is available online at the Camel website:

Mailing Lists - Apache Camel Blog Documentation Community Download Mailing Lists Contents Use Camel User List Post plain text mails Use Camel User List You should post and subscribe to the Camel User List for all your questions on using Camel, or how to do X with Camel etc. If in doubt use this list. The Camel Developer List, is for the Camel team to discus development of the actual Camel project; do not use this list for questions on using Camel. Again to re-iterate, use the Camel User List, for your Camel questions. This is the correct mailing list, and has the most people there ready for helping you. Post plain text mails When posting to the mailing lists, use plain text mails. Do not use HTML mails. HTML mails is more likely to be targeted as spam mails and will be rejected; as well it’s not easily readable by others.

Support - Apache Camel Blog Documentation Community Download Support Contents Getting help Reporting bugs - Please read this first Reporting security issues Alternative discussion forums Using deprecated components How to get help How to get help faster Commercial Support Getting help If you are experiencing problems using Camel then please report your problem to our mailing list or Zulip chat. This allows the entire community to help with your problem. If indeed a bug has been identified in the Camel software, then document the problem in our Issue Tracker. Please refrain from immediately opening a ticket in the issue tracker unless you are certain it’s a problem in the Camel software. If you are in doubt, we appreciate asking the mailing list or Zulip chat first. Please read the section below (How to get help), and follow the bullets advised there first: Issue tracker FAQ Reporting bugs - Please read this first We prefer people to get in touch first using the mailing list, or Zulip chat. Or take time to read FAQs, or search in the mailing list archives to find answers. Unfortunately some people create a JIRA ticket as first thing. Please don’t do that! Only if you are sure it really is a bug etc. JIRA tickets create noise for the Camel team to react on issues that are not bugs but are already covered in FAQs, in the mailing lists etc., or in the existing documentation. Also on the mailing lists there are more people active to help you better. Also please avoid sending direct emails to members of the Camel team - we are busy already. And conversations about Camel should happen in the public, and not via private emails. Reporting security issues If you have found a security issue in Camel please contact the Apache Software Foundation security team. Don’t share the details in public (i.e. chat or users/developer mailing lists). We will receive details you send and resolve the issue as soon as possible. We might also contact you requesting further details as needed. Alternative discussion forums There’s a number of sites outside Apache that offer discussion forums on Camel. For example, Stack Overflow is a popular Q & A site with a dedicated Apache Camel forum. You are also likely to find helpful discussions on technical blogs, on Google, or even on Twitter. Using deprecated components Deprecated components are not supported and issues such as bugs may not be fixed. We encourage users to migrate away from using any deprecated component. A list of deprecated components is listed on the github page at: https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/components#components How to get help Before you report a problem, you may wish to read the FAQ. When you report an issue, please be sure to include as much information as possible. The more we know, the easier it is to reach an effective solution quickly. What version do you use What version of Camel do you use? Remember to include this information. what are the version numbers of involved software components? (this is very important to detail) what platform and JDK? any particular container being used? and if so, what version? stack traces generally really help! (Remember to post which version of Camel you use, this is important to know when posting stacktraces.) If in doubt, include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in other exceptions and the exception right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few lines at the top. It’s very easy for us to skim-read past unnecessary parts of a stack trace. log output can be useful too; sometimes enabling DEBUG logging can help your code & configuration files are often useful did it work before? what have you changed to break it? try upgrading to the latest release and see if it’s fixed there try the latest SNAPSHOT to see if it’s fixed in the pre-release search the user forum to see if has been discussed before see the “known issues” section in the release notes and check the issue tracker to see if the issue has already been reported do not send private emails to Camel Team members to ask them to help you faster, or in the private only. Help on Apache Camel is volunteer based and must happen in the open on the public Mailing Lists. If you want to get help faster or in private, then see further below. How to get help faster We can help you much quicker if you try the following provide us with a JUnit test case that demonstrates your issue. e.g. if you think you’ve found a bug, can you create a test case to demonstrate the bug? submit a patch fixing the bug! (We also buy you beer when we meet you if you submit bug fixes (smile) ) for memory leak or performance related issues, if you can run a profiler on your test case and attach the output as a file (or zipped file if it’s huge) to the JIRA we can normally fix things much faster. For example, you could run jmap/jhat, JProfiler or YourKit on your code and send us the output. To find memory leaks it’s quicker to resolve if you can tell us what classes are taking up all of the RAM; we can normally figure out what’s wrong from that. Commercial Support This is an open source project, so the amount of time we have available to help resolve your issue is often limited as all help is provided on a volunteer basis. If you want to get priority help, need to get up to speed quickly, require some training or mentoring, or need full 24 x 7 production support you could contact one of the following companies with Commercial Camel Offerings.

If you don’t fancy using Maven you can use your IDE directly or Download a distribution or JAR. Prequisites Required: Java 1.8 or 1.11 Maven Wrapper is used and bundled. Otherwise, download and install Maven Maven 3.6.x or newer is required to build Camel 3 onwards Get the latest source from Github Maven options To build camel maven has to be configured to use more memory Unix/Linux/Mac export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms2048m -Xmx3584m" Windows set MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms2048m -Xmx3584m" A normal build Beware this runs all the unit tests which takes a couple of hours. mvn clean install A quick build without running tests The following skips building the manual, the distro and does not execute the unit tests, which can complete in 15-20 minutes. mvn clean install -Pfastinstall A normal build without running tests but checkstyle verification enabled mvn clean install -Pfastinstall,sourcecheck Building with checkstyle To enable source style checking with checkstyle, build Camel with the -Psourcecheck parameter mvn clean install -Psourcecheck Building source jars If you want to build jar files with the source code, that for instance Eclipse can important so you can debug the Camel code as well. Then you can run this command from the camel root folder: mvn clean source:jar install -Pfastinstall Working with karaf features If you change anything in the features.xml from platform/karaf you can run a validation step to ensure the generated features.xml file is correct. You can do this running the following maven goal from the platform directory. mvn clean install -Pvalidate Back to top Overview＋ Blog Documentation Community Download Documentation＋ User Manual Components Camel-K Camel Kafka Connector Camel Quarkus Camel Spring Boot Camel Karaf FAQ Community＋ Support Contributing Mailing Lists User stories Articles Books Team About＋ Acknowledgments Apache Events License Security Sponsorship Thanks © 2004-2021 The Apache Software Foundation.

Then come back here and you might want to read the following documentation before continuing: Longer Getting Started Guide Find out about Enterprise Integration Patterns and how to implement them with Camel Review the Architecture guide to see how to build Routes using the Java DSL or XML DSL Working with CamelContexts and RouteBuilders To get started with Camel: Create a CamelContext. Optionally, configure components or endpoints. Add whatever routing rules you wish using the DSL and RouteBuilder or using XML DSL. Start the Camel context. When your application is closing you may wish to stop the context When you are ready, why not Walk through an Example? And then continue the walk Walk through another example. Working with Spring If you use Spring as a Dependency Injection container then please refer to the Camel Spring documentation. Other Resources We strongly suggest that you brew a cup of coffee or tea and take the 30 minutes to read one or more of the following resources: Camel in Action, Chapter 1 (direct link) free chapter 1 of the Camel in Action book. Highly recommended to read to learn what Camel is and the basic Camel concepts. This is a free chapter you can download directly as a pdf (about 20 pages) and introduces you to Camel. We have been told by experience Camel end users they wished this chapter was available to them when they started learning Camel. Open Source Integration with Apache Camel and How Fuse IDE Can Help by Jonathan Anstey. Updated article of the Apache Camel: Integration Nirvana. Great article to learn what Camel is and has a good use case example. Several of the vendors on the Commercial Camel Offerings page also offer various tutorials, webinars, examples, etc…​. that may be useful. Articles is a link collection with articles, blogs, podcasts, presentations and the likes about Camel done by people from the community.

Apache Camel
Apache Camel is a powerful, open-source integration framework based on prevalent
Enterprise Integration Patterns with powerful bean integration.
Introduction
Camel enables the creation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns to implement routing
and mediation rules in either a Java-based Domain Specific Language (or Fluent API),
via Spring or Blueprint based Xml Configuration files, or via the Scala DSL.
That means you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE whether
in your Java, Scala, or XML editor.
Apache Camel uses URIs to enable easier integration with all kinds of
transport or messaging model including HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA

Description
In the User Manual, most of the files in the "Community" section (Mailing Lists, Support, Team, User Stories, as well as Books in the "Resources & Guides" section, exist as .adoc files in the camel project but also as .md files in camel-website/content/community. Some links in the website reference adoc files and others reference md files.
Both sets of files have changes so the content is not always consistent.Only one set of files should be maintained and the other ones should be removed.
After discussion with Zoran Regvart it has been decided to remove the .adoc files and keep the .md files.
The Community section in the user manual navigation panel and index page will be removed.
The /CONTRIBUTING.md in the GitHub Camel repository contains almost the same content as the contributing.adoc file in the User Manual. The main contributing content will be put in the camel-website/content/community section. The CONTRIBUTING.md file at the repository root will be contain only the guidelines for actually making a contribution and it will link to the Community contributing.md file.

@gnodet there is a log file created by failsafe. Within the component directory (ie.: component/camel-couchbase) there should be a file named target/camel-couchbase-test.log which should display something like:

Do you have that file?
Yes, you're right. The file is here and the reason Could not find a valid Docker environment. too. It seems not really intuitive to not have anything in the maven log somehow.
I wonder if we could have the tests flagged as if a junit assumption was not met (which is somewhat the case), the problem is that they are simply not listed at all.

1+. Currently the ContainerService inherits a ExecutionCondition to handle this, but this silent failure behavior could be improved. I need to research what we could do here as I am not entirely sure I can use the assumption at that point.

I was hoping I could come up with a cleaner solution, but I wanted to avoid any more complex solution based on TestExecutionListener for now.
So, what I end up doing is, I disabled the redirectTestOutputToFile and added and error message when Docker is not available.
