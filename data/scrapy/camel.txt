Camel enables the creation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns to implement routing
and mediation rules in either a Java-based Domain Specific Language (or Fluent API),
via Spring or Blueprint based Xml Configuration files, or via the Scala DSL.
That means you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE whether
in your Java, Scala, or XML editor.
Apache Camel uses URIs to enable easier integration with all kinds of
transport or messaging model including HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA
or CXF together with working with pluggable Data Format options.
Apache Camel is a small library that has minimal dependencies for easy embedding
in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work with the same API regardless of the
transport type, making it possible to interact with all the components provided out-of-the-box,
with a good understanding of the API.
Apache Camel has powerful Bean Binding and integrated seamlessly with
popular frameworks such as Spring, CDI, and Blueprint.
Apache Camel has extensive testing support allowing you to easily
unit test your routes.

Fixed the examples by using the correct classes
Open the examples in the IDE
To better work on all examples, make sure you have all them locally by checking out the git repository:
git clone git@github.com:apache/camel-k-examples.git
We suggest you to open the examples with VSCode because it provides useful extensions for working with Camel K files.
If you've already installed it on your machine, after cloning the repository, you can open the examples on the IDE executing:
code camel-k-examples
We suggest you to install the following extensions for VSCode (The IDE should automatically prompt to ask you to install them):
Extension Pack for Apache Camel: provides auto-completion, error handling as well as integrated IDE tools to manage the lifecycle of Camel K integrations
Didact: Provides a better getting started experience when following readme files in the various examples
Have your Kubernetes cluster ready
All examples require that you are connected to a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, even a local instance such as Minikube or CRC. Some advanced examples may have additional requirements.
Ensure that you've followed the Camel K installation guide for your specific cluster before looking at the examples.
Install the CLI tools
All examples need at least the following CLI tools installed on your system:
kubectl: the Kubernetes default CLI tool that can be downloaded from the Kubernetes releases page.
kamel: the Apache Camel K CLI that can be downloaded from the Camel K release page.
Examples
Examples are contained in directories ordered by level of difficulty.
Most examples provide a readme.didact.md file instead of the standard readme file. For those, if you're using VSCode with Didact installed, you can right click on the readme.didact.md file and hit "Didact: Start Didact Tutorial from File".

Getting Started
Camel K allows to run integrations directly on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
To use it, you need to be connected to a cloud environment or to a local cluster created for development purposes.
If you need help on how to create a local development environment based on Minishift or Minikube, you can follow the local cluster setup guide.

Installation
Make sure you apply specific configuration settings for your cluster before installing Camel K. Customized instructions are needed for
the following cluster types:
Minikube
Minishift
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
OpenShift
IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS)
Other cluster types (such as OpenShift clusters) should not need prior configuration.
To start using Camel K you need the "kamel" binary, that can be used to both configure the cluster and run integrations.
Look into the release page for latest version of the kamel tool.
If you want to contribute, you can also build it from source! Refer to the contributing guide
for information on how to do it.
Once you have the "kamel" binary, log into your cluster using the standard "oc" (OpenShift) or "kubectl" (Kubernetes) client tool and execute the following command to install Camel K:
kamel install
This will configure the cluster with the Camel K custom resource definitions and install the operator on the current namespace.
Important
Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) are cluster-wide objects and you need admin rights to install them. Fortunately this
operation can be done once per cluster. So, if the kamel install operation fails, you’ll be asked to repeat it when logged as admin.
For Minishift, this means executing oc login -u system:admin then kamel install --cluster-setup only for first-time installation.

Running an Integration
After the initial setup, you can run a Camel integration on the cluster by executing:
kamel run examples/languages/Sample.java
During your first run you may see your console stuck with the following message:
integration "sample" created
integration "sample" in phase Waiting For Platform
Note
It will take some time for your integration to get started for the first time. This is because the camel-k operator has to pull and cache the camel-k builder images into the cluster’s registry.
You can follow this process by watching the pods in the namespace where the operator is running:
kubectl get pods -w
You should see something like:
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
camel-k-cache 0/1 Completed 0 3m29s

A "Sample.java" file is included in the /examples folder of this repository. You can change the content of the file and execute the command again to see the changes.
Configure Integration properties
Properties associated to an integration can be configured either using a ConfigMap/Secret or by setting using the "--property" flag, i.e.
kamel run --property my.message=test examples/props.js
kamel run --configmap=<your name here> examples/props.js
Note: to create the config map first create a file called application.properties which contains lines with key=value pairs
e.g. my.message="The text to display"
Create the config map in the usual manner e.g.
kubectl create configmap <your name here> --from-file=application.properties
Configure Integration Logging
camel-k runtime uses log4j2 as logging framework and can be configured through integration properties.

Apache Camel extensions for Quarkus
CI Branch Status
master
camel-master
quarkus-master
This project is still in its infancy. Is it relatively stable and leverages more than a decade of Apache Camel
experience and maturity. At the same time, it is in constant evolution. Almost every week new features are implemented
and current ones adjusted to integrate better with both Camel and Kafka Connect.
This is a "Camel Kafka connector adapter" that aims to provide a user-friendly way to use all Apache Camel components in Kafka Connect.
For more information about Kafka Connect take a look here.
Build the project
mvn clean package
Run integration tests
To run the integration tests it is required to:
have Docker version 17.05 or higher running
then run:
mvn -DskipIntegrationTests=false clean verify package
It is also possible to point the tests to use an external services. Please check the
testing guide.
Documentation
Read the Official latest documentation or try the local Getting started guide.

You can’t perform that action at this time.
If you need to change the logging level of various loggers, you can do so by using the logging.level prefix:
logging.level.org.apache.camel = DEBUG
Configure Integration Components
camel-k component can be configured programmatically inside an integration or using properties with the following syntax.
As example if you want to change the queue size of the seda component, you can use the following property:
camel.component.seda.queueSize = 10
Configure Integration Volumes
It’s possible to mount persistent volumes into integration containers by using the -v or --volume flag. The format of volume flag value is similar to that of the docker CLI. But instead of specifying a host path to mount from, you reference the name of a PersistentVolumeClaim that you have already configured within the cluster. E.g
kamel run examples/Sample.java -v myPvcName:/some/path
Configure Environment Variables
It’s possible to configure environment variables for integration containers by using the -e or --env flag:
kamel run examples/Sample.java -e MY_ENV_VAR=some-value
Running Integrations in "Dev" Mode for Fast Feedback
If you want to iterate quickly on an integration to have fast feedback on the code you’re writing, you can use by running it in "dev" mode:
kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev
The --dev flag deploys immediately the integration and shows the integration logs in the console. You can then change the code and see
the changes automatically applied (instantly) to the remote integration pod.
The console follows automatically all redeploys of the integration.
Here’s an example of the output:
[nferraro@localhost camel-k]$ kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev
integration "sample" created
integration "sample" in phase Building
What is this
This project hosts the efforts to port and package the 300+ Camel components as Quarkus extensions.
Apache Camel is the Swiss knife of integrating heterogeneous systems with more than a decade
of history and a lively community of users and developers.
Quarkus is a Java platform offering fast boot times and low memory footprint. It targets both stock
JVMs (OpenJDK in the first place) and GraalVM.
Quarkus extensions are units of Quarkus distribution. They configure, boot and integrate
a technology (in our case Camel components) into your Quarkus application. You will typically use them as dependencies
in your project.
How to build
See the contributor guide in the source tree or on the
Apache Camel website.

Since the integration is using the "imap:" prefix, Camel K is able to automatically add the "camel-mail" component to the list of required dependencies.
This will be transparent to the user, that will just see the integration running.
Automatic resolution is also a nice feature in --dev mode, because you are allowed to add all components you need without exiting the dev loop.
You can also use the -d flag to pass additional explicit dependencies to the Camel client tool:
kamel run -d mvn:com.google.guava:guava:26.0-jre -d camel-mina2 Integration.java
Not Just Java
Camel K supports multiple languages for writing integrations:

Welcome to the Apache Camel Spring-Boot Examples
Introduction
This project contains the various examples for working with Apache
Camel Spring Boot. The examples can be run using Maven. When using the Maven
command, Maven will attempt to download the required dependencies from a
central repository to your local repository.
View the individual example READMEs for details.
Executing
Master branch should only be used for development purposes, which will be pointing
to the SNAPSHOT version of the next release.
To execute the examples, checkout into the tag for the latest release. For example:
$ git checkout tags/camel-spring-boot-examples-3.5.0
Then, install the root pom:
$ mvn install
After that, you should be able to execute the examples following each example’s
readme’s instructions.

If your are on Linux, docker is sufficient for the native mode too. Use -Pnative,docker instead of -Pnative if you choose this option. Java 11 Maven 3.6.2+ (unless you use the Maven Wrapper, a.k.a. mvnw available in the source tree). How to build Checkout the code $ git clone https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus.git
$ cd camel-quarkus A fast build without tests and various checks: $ mvn clean install -Dquickly A build with integration tests in the JVM mode only: $ mvn clean install A build with integration tests in both the JVM mode and the native mode: $ mvn clean install -Pnative You may want to install and use mvnd - the Maven Daemon for faster builds. What’s next? Create new extension. Promote a JVM extension to Native.

This should solve apache/camel-k-runtime#677
Without this, the catalog seems to generate its own bogus qute.json. Then, during camel-k-runtime build, it gets picked instead of the one available in camel-quarkus-qute-component jar.

Looking at the CI failure - maybe we need to split the prepare-catalog-quarkus and check-extension-pages goals into separate executions with their own configuration. Otherwise the extension docs will get removed for qute.

The build seems unable to resolve javaType from the QuteComponent which seems to cause it to fail to generate the catalog. This fails the build.

These virtual deps only serve as module ordering hints for mvnd or mvn -T. Moreover they are 100% generated. If you run mvn process-resources -Pformat -N from the repo root (which recommended after changing dependencies), the change will get reverted. Could you please explain your motivation for the change?

Wouldn't this actually exclude the Qute component from the Camel Quarkus Catalog? - Is that what you want?

Reading apache/camel-k-runtime#677 I am still not 100% sure what is the problem. org.apache.camel.component.qute.QuteComponent exists in org.apache.camel.quarkus:camel-quarkus-qute-component:jar Don't you need to add it to your class path?

I think the one bundled in the catalog jar is taking precedence in the classpath. Thus causing the issue on 667.

@ppalaga I'm leaning towards no, in this case, but I wouldn't know for sure. I think that, in the case of the Camel K catalog, and specifically in this problem, it is reading the javaType info and not the metadata.

@ppalaga @jamesnetherton I've test the updated PR, based on your comments and it worked for the Camel K Runtime. It is, indeed, caused by the bogus qube.json file on the catalog jar.
That said, I understand it may not be desirable from Camel Quarkus perspective. So I'd like to hear your insights, please: do you feel this is an appropriate approach or should I pursue a different strategy for dealing with this?

@ppalaga how do you want to handle this? This would remove remove the broken qute.json from the catalog. Is there a simple means of getting a correct JSON file included?

I am all for clarifying this.
Removing qute.json from CQ catalog would not be correct. The extension and component exist and we support it. Removal would impact a couple of our tools that utilize the info from the catalog.

I checked what qute.json looks like and indeed the metadata is missing. Also componentProperties and properties are missing. @orpiske could you please check which particular parts are required by Camel K?

This would be useful because as today in camel-k you can declare a dependency by using the artifact id, so as example, to include the direct component you can use
kamel run integration.yaml -d camel-direct
With quarkus, you need to use the quarkus one, like:
kamel run integration.yaml -d camel-quarkus-direct
But since the runtime is an implementation detail, it would be nice to let users declaring dependencies using the camel artifact id and to make it possible we need to have the information about the artifact the extension has been created from.
The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:

A Camel Quarkus extension can depend on zero to n Camel artifacts. Do you have an idea where/how to store that info?
Not sure adding a field to org.apache.camel.tooling.model.ArtifactModel is the best way to go. It would have little to no meaning in the context of Camel Core. Maybe we should add a free form map for this kind of ad hoc attributes that are only meaningful for Camel subprojects?

Thanks for looking at this. We need (using activemq one as a reference only):
The javaType: https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/components/camel-activemq/src/generated/resources/org/apache/camel/component/activemq/activemq.json#L10
The scheme: https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/components/camel-activemq/src/generated/resources/org/apache/camel/component/activemq/activemq.json#L15
The groupId and artifactId: https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/components/camel-activemq/src/generated/resources/org/apache/camel/component/activemq/activemq.json#L12-L13
For data formats, we also need the name: https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/components/camel-activemq/src/generated/resources/org/apache/camel/component/activemq/activemq.json#L4

Maybe we could look at doing what Quarkus does and combine most of these under a quickly profile. E.g mvn clean install -Dquickly.

Hm... I am a bit undecided, what should be there in -Dquickly. I tend to think that most of times when I want to build quickly, -Dformatter.skip -Dimpsort.skip -Denforce=false -Dcamel-quarkus.update-extension-doc-page.skip should not be there, because in that way, I'd end up with unformated source tree with bad deps and stale docs.

It depends on what you want to achieve i.e. if you check out master and you want a quick way to install everything because you are working on a side project that depends on latest camel-quarkus bits, you don't care about formatting or stale docs.

Here an idea what we could do:
Current state
As a consequence of that all the other jobs have to wait for the JVM tests (40+ mins IIRC) to finish
Proposed state
The initial build on Java 11 should skip the tests and Quarkus mojos:

The skipped tests should be run in three (groups of) separate jobs:
Functional unit tests (under extensions-core and extensions directories)
JVM tests under extensions-jvm
JVM and native tests under integration-tests
The group 3. is covered by the current native-tests job. I think there is no need to change it.
Groups 1. and 2. are new.
Open questions:
How would this play with alternative JVM Jobs?
I hope the groups 1., 2., and 3. cover all tests we have?
WDYT?

Sounds ok to me in principal.
I hope the groups 1., 2., and 3. cover all tests we have?
Some of the examples have itests, so maybe we should run those in their own group?

Books - Apache Camel Blog Documentation Community Download Books Contents Camel in Action 2nd edition Camel in Action Apache Camel Developer’s Cookbook Camel Design Patterns Mastering Apache Camel Instant Apache Camel Message Routing Instant Apache Camel Messaging System Enterprise Integration Patterns This page lists the known books about Apache Camel. If you happen to know a book which is not listed then please contact us, for example using the Mailing Lists. Camel in Action 2nd edition Camel in Action Apache Camel Developer’s Cookbook Camel Design Patterns Mastering Apache Camel Instant Apache Camel Message Routing Instant Apache Camel Messaging System Enterprise Integration Patterns Camel in Action 2nd edition Camel in Action 2nd edition by Claus Ibsen and Jonathan Anstey. Published by Manning in 2018. Camel in Action, Second Edition is the most complete Camel book on the market. Written by core developers of Camel and the authors of the highly acclaimed first edition, this book distills their experience and practical insights so that you can tackle integration tasks like a pro. Camel in Action Camel in Action by Claus Ibsen and Jonathan Anstey. Published by Manning in December 2010. Camel in Action is a Camel tutorial full of small examples showing how to work with the integration patterns. It starts with core concepts like sending, receiving, routing, and transforming data. It then shows you the entire lifecycle and goes in depth on how to test, deal with errors, scale, deploy, and even monitor your app—details you can find only in the Camel code itself. Written by the developers of Camel, this book distills their experience and practical insights so that you can tackle integration tasks like a pro. Apache Camel Developer’s Cookbook Apache Camel Developer’s Cookbook by Scott Cranton and Jakub Korab. Published by Packt publishing in December 2013. Apache Camel Developer’s Cookbook is a collection of over 100 how-to recipes for working with Apache Camel. It is intended for use by busy developers who may not necessarily have time to learn the whole framework in order to be productive. It does this without sacrificing any of the detail needed to build performant, reliable system integrations. Developers new to Apache Camel will find useful information on how to set up Camel in both regular Java and Spring-based applications, through to the ins-and-outs of the various Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) (how they are affected by multithreading, transactions etc.), payload transformations and testing. Experienced developers will also benefit from coverage of parallel and asynchronous processing, error handling and compensation, transactions and idempotency, monitoring and debugging, as well as Camel’s support for security. All recipes are backed by fully unit-tested example code in both the Java and XML DSLs, all of which is available on github at CamelCookbook/camel-cookbook-examples. Camel Design Patterns Camel Design Patterns by Bilgin Ibryam. Published by LeanPub in start of 2016. Patterns, Principles, and Practices for designing Apache Camel applications. A developer friendly guide with real world use cases and practical tips for designing and architecting Apache Camel applications. There are great books about Apache Camel already, but this book is a little bit different. Here is why. Throughout the building of a Camel application, there are many levels of design decisions to be made. Knowing the Camel framework and the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) is a must, but not enough to architect a real world integration application. Mastering such applications requires an understanding of EIPs, Messaging, Microservices and SOA principles, and distributed system concepts as a whole. Driven by real world experiences, this book consolidates the most commonly used patterns and principles for designing Camel applications. For each pattern, there is a problem description with a context, a proposed solution, and Camel specifics and tips around the implementation. Patterns range from individual Camel route design for happy path scenarios, to error handling and prevention practices, to principles used in the deployment of multiple routes and applications for scalability and high availability purposes. Mastering Apache Camel Mastering Apache Camel by Jean-Baptiste Onofré. Published by Packt publishing in June 2015. This book will provide you with the skills you need to efficiently create routes using Apache Camel. After briefly introducing the key features and core concepts of Camel, the book will take you through all the important features and components, starting with routing and processors. You will learn how to use beans in Camel routes, covering everything from supported registries and annotations, to the creation of an OSGi bundle and writing route definitions with Blueprint DSL. Leverage the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) supported by Camel and implement them in your routes. You will then see how components and endpoints handle exchanges in Camel, and how you can use them to create a complete and powerful mediation framework. You will finally learn how to tackle errors and perform testing to ensure that your integration projects are working successfully. Instant Apache Camel Message Routing Instant Apache Camel Message Routing by Bilgin Ibryam. Published by Packt publishing in August 2013. Instant Apache Camel Message Routing will help you to get started with Camel and Enterprise Integration Patterns in the matter of hours. It is a short, focused and practical guide to Apache Camel that provides a high level overview of the Camel architecture and message routing principles.

Camel K provide sensible defaults for all such traits, taking into account the details of the target platform where the integration is going to run into. However, it’s possible for a expert user to configure them in order to obtain a different behavior. Configuration Each trait has a unique ID that can be used to configure it using the command line tool. E.g. in order to disable the creation of a Service for a integration, a user can execute: kamel run --trait service.enabled=false file.groovy The flag --trait can be also abbreviated with -t. The enabled property is available on all traits and can be used to enable/disable them. All traits have their own internal logic to determine if they need to be enabled when the user does not activate them explicitly. Some traits share also a auto property that can be used to enable/disable auto-configuration of the trait based on the environment. The auto-configuration mechanism is able to enable/disable the trait when the enabled property is not explicitly set by the user and also change the trait configuration. Some traits are applicable only to specific platforms (see the "profiles" in the trait description page). A trait may have additional properties that can be configured by the end user. See the trait description pages for more information on a specific trait: There are 34 traits. 3scale Trait Affinity Trait Builder Trait Camel Trait Container Trait Cron Trait Dependencies Trait Deployer Trait Deployment Trait Environment Trait Error Handler Trait Gc Trait Ingress Trait Istio Trait Jolokia Trait Jvm Trait Kamelets Trait Knative Service Trait Knative Trait Logging Trait Master Trait Openapi Trait Owner Trait Pdb Trait Platform Trait Pod Trait Prometheus Trait Pull Secret Trait Quarkus Trait Route Trait Service Binding Trait Service Trait Toleration Trait Tracing Trait Back to top Overview＋ Blog Documentation Community Download Documentation＋ User Manual Components Camel-K Camel Kafka Connector Camel Quarkus Camel Spring Boot Camel Karaf FAQ Community＋ Support Contributing Mailing Lists User stories Articles Books Team About＋ Acknowledgments Apache Events License Security Sponsorship Thanks © 2004-2021 The Apache Software Foundation.

Visual Studio extension to support Apache Camel K
First, what is Apache Camel K? According to its Github Readme, “Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration platform, born on Kubernetes, with serverless superpowers.” Essentially Camel K enables developers to run integrations on Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters which enables them to get Camel-based integration solutions up and running very quickly!
Our goal for the Tooling for Apache Camel K extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is to make that process even more seamless.
For more information about Camel K, be sure to check out its documentation and github pages.
Before you begin
In order to use our Tooling for Apache Camel K extension for VS Code, you must have the following software in place:
An instance of Apache Camel K running on a Kubernetes or an OpenShift cluster that is accessible from your system on your network. You must also have Minikube (or the Kubernetes CLI) installed. See the Apache Camel K installation page for details: (https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/installation.html).
Microsoft VS Code installed. You can get the most recent version from (https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your chosen operating system.
To benefit from Java Language completion on standalone files, VS Code Language support for java needs to be installed.
To benefit from Java debug on standalone files, VS Code Debugger for Java needs to be installed.
Installing the extension
The Tooling for Apache Camel K extension is available in the VS Code Extension Marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-camelk).
Steps
Open your VS Code Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
In the VS Code Activity Bar, select Extensions. (Alternately, press Ctrl+Shift+X).
In the search bar, type Apache Camel K
In the Tooling for Apache Camel K box, click Install.
In addition, we encourage you to also install these VS Code extensions:
Kubernetes Tools extension from Microsoft - This extension offers a number of supplemental tools you can use with Minikube and Apache Camel K to check pod status and more. It is available here (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools).
Language Support for Apache Camel (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel) - This extension provides auto-completion for Camel components, attributes, and the list of attribute values in the Camel URI for integrations written in XML, Java, Groovy, JavaScript, and Kotlin.
You can install them by following the same steps except search for Kubernetes or Apache Camel in the list of extensions.
Get started using Didact tutorial
A tutorial to get started is available when VS Code Didact is installed. It is accessible through the Didact Tutorials view:
The tutorial is providing a detailed step-by-step description and is integrated in VS Code. When finished, you can continue to look to this readme which contains broader scope information.
Creating a new Camel K Integration file
From command palette, choose Create a new Apache Camel K Integration file
Choose the language to use.
Choose the workspace folder
Provide a name for the new file
The new Apache Camel K Integration file is created at the root of the chosen workspace folder.
Starting a new Camel K Integration
After your Apache Camel K/Minikube environment is running and you have installed the Tooling for Apache Camel K (vscode-camelk) extension, you can start a new Apache Camel K integration.
You can start a new Camel K integration with or without additional options such as ConfigMaps or Secrets. (For information about how to publish a ConfigMap or Secret, see Publishing new Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets).
In the VS Code Explorer, right-click on an integration file that is one of the following file types:
Java (*.java)
Camel plain XML DSL (not Spring XML or Blueprint) (*.xml)
JavaScript (*.js)
Groovy (*.groovy)
Kotlin (*.kts)
Yaml (*.yaml) (Experimental)
For more information about supported languages, see Languages in the Apache Camel-K documentation.
In the popup menu, select Start Apache Camel K Integration.
A drop-down appears in the command palette with several choices:
Dev Mode - Apache Camel K Integration in Dev Mode
In “Dev Mode,” all output is directed to the Apache Camel K output channel, including startup tasks. In addition, when you update the integration file, the integration is re-deployed automatically for easier development and debugging. For more information about Dev Mode, see Running in Dev Mode in the Apache Camel-K documentation.
Basic - Apache Camel K Integration (no ConfigMap or Secret)
The "Basic" option starts the file as a new integration to deploy the integration to the running Kubernetes system.
ConfigMap - Apache Camel K Integration with Kubernetes ConfigMap
Select a ConfigMap from a list of the published ConfigMaps in your current Kubernetes system. For example:
Secret - Apache Camel K Integration with Kubernetes Secret
Select a Secret from a list of the published Secrets in your current Kubernetes system. For more information about configuration with ConfigMaps or Secrets, see Configuration via ConfigMap or Secret in the Apache Camel K documentation.
Resource - Apache Camel K Integration with Resource file
Select one or more resource files from the file selection dialog.
Property - Apache Camel K Integration with Property
Specify property name/property value pairs, with the option to specify more than one. For more information about configuration with properties, see Configure Integrations in the Apache Camel-K documentation.
Dependencies - Apache Camel K Integration with Explicit Dependencies
Specify dependency details either by their camel-component artifact Id or by their Maven coordinates (group:artifact:version), with the option to specify more than one. For more information about configuration with Dependencies, see Dependencies and Component Resolution in the Apache Camel K documentation.
Language Support for Apache Camel by Red Hat - Visual Studio Marketplace
Define a Task for Easily Reproducible Multi-attribute Deployment
Some types of deployments require more complex combinations of attributes. In these cases, defining a custom Task of type "camel-k" is useful. To create a task, see sectionCreating a new Camel K Integration with multiple parameters
When you start a new integration, the extension starts the deployment process with the kamel run [filename] command and any options after that.
Note: The first time that you publish a new integration, the extension might take a few moments to propagate through the system to a running state.
To update the state of your currently deployed integrations, hover over the Apache Camel K Integrations view and click the Refresh button.
Creating a new Camel K Integration task configuration with multiple parameters
Though the simple "Start Apache Camel K Integration" menu works well for simple cases, you can use a Task for more complex integrations. When the Camel K integration requires more configuration, you can set that up using a Task.
To create a new Task, you have a few options.
From command palette, call the Tasks: Configure Task command. This will open the tasks.json file where you can enter new task info by hand (with some auto-completion support in the editor). If you already have a tasks.json but no Camel K tasks, you can create a new task with type camel-k in the tasks.json which is automatically opened.
If you don't have any Tasks configured yet, you can use the camel-k: Start in dev mode Camel K integration opened in active editor command, which will template an initial Camel K task for you.
You will end up with something like the following with a new, empty Camel K task specified:
{
// See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
// for the documentation about the tasks.json format
"version": "2.0.0",
"tasks": [
{
"type": "camel-k",

Apache Camel for Visual Studio Code
This is a preview release of the Visual Studio Code extension that adds Apache Camel language support for XML DSL and Java DSL code.
When you add this extension to your installation of VS Code, the VS Code editor provides the following features:
Language service support for Apache Camel URIs (both XML DSL and Java DSL)
Auto-completion for Camel components, attributes, and the list of attribute values
XML DSL
Java DSL
Camel-K Groovy DSL (It requires to have file named with the pattern *.camelk.groovy or that the file starts with // camel-k:)
Camel-K Kotlin DSL (It requires to have file named with the pattern _*.camelk.kts or that the file starts with // camel-k:)
Camel-K JavaScript DSL (It requires to have file named with the pattern _*.camelk.js or that the file starts with // camel-k:)
Camel Kafka Connect properties
Camel-K Yaml DSL (It requires to have file named with the pattern *.camelk.yaml or that the file starts with // camel-k:)
Camel properties file (restricted to camel components ids and camel components properties)
Quick reference documentation when you hover the cursor over a Camel component
Diagnostics for Camel URIs
"dev": true,
"problemMatcher": []
}
]
}
Note: We recommend adding a label attribute to more easily find your task in the task list when you try to run it.
Once you've created your Camel K task, you can use auto-complete to explore the various parameters available. The following example launches the integration in --dev mode and provides a couple of dependencies:
{
"type": "camel-k",
"label": "Run RestWithUndertow and Dependencies",
"dev": true,
"file": "./examples/RestWithUndertow.java",
"problemMatcher": [],
"dependencies": [ "camel-rest", "camel-undertow" ]
}
When you've defined your Task, you can use one of two options to execute it:
call command from palette Tasks: Run Task. You will see the command listed with the label that you provided previously.
with the Start Apache Camel Integration command, pick the option Use a predefined Task - useful for multi-attributes deployment

After running the camel-k Task, a terminal will open where you can see the command used and any execution result.
Publishing new Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets
You can use the Tooling for Apache Camel K extension to create ConfigMaps and Secrets and publish them to the running Kubernetes system.
###Before you begin
You must have a *.properties file that you want to use as the basis for the ConfigMap or Secret. Properties files consist of name/value pairs. Each property can then be referenced in a route by the property name to use the value by reference.
For example, you might have an application.properties file that has two entries:
my.message=Hello World
logging.level.org.apache.camel=DEBUG
Steps
In the VS Code Explorer view, right-click on the *.properties file.
Select one of the following options:
Create Kubernetes Config Map from File
Create Kubernetes Secret from File
Type the name of your new ConfigMap or Secret. The name must start with a letter and contain no spaces. You can use numbers or hyphens. For example, my-config-map is a valid name but my config map is not.
Press Enter. The extension creates a new ConfigMap or Secret that you can reference in your Apache Camel K route.
For more information about configuration with ConfigMaps or Secrets, see Configuration via ConfigMap or Secret in the Apache Camel-K documentation for more details.
Viewing the status of published integrations
After you publish a new integration, it appears in the Apache Camel K Integrations view in the Side Bar of the Explorer activity:
When you add or remove file-based integrations in the Explorer view, it automatically refreshes the list.
Note: Refreshing the view sometimes is delayed as pods start. You might need to wait a few seconds. Optionally, to manually refresh the list, click the Refresh button.
.setBody().constant('Hello world from Camel K')
.to('log:info') You can then execute the following command: kamel run helloworld.groovy The integration code immediately runs in the cloud. Nothing else is needed.

It is possible to use a specific Camel Catalog version. This can be specified in File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Apache Camel Tooling -> Camel catalog version
To use a Red Hat integration productized version, you need to configure extra repositories. See in Camel Language Server documentation.
It is possible to use a specific Runtime provider for the Camel catalog. This can be specified in File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Apache Camel Tooling -> Camel catalog runtime provider
Additional Camel components can be provided. This can be specified in File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Apache Camel Tooling -> Extra-components -> Edit in settings.json
You can add a list of Camel components definition. This json definition can be found in jar of the Camel component. You will end up with something like:
{
"camel.extra-components": [{
"component": {
...
},
"componentProperties": {
The status of deployment for Integrations is indicated by the color of the dot in the K icon for the integration. If green, the integration is in a "Running" state. If red, it is in another state, such as "Building Kit" or "Error". Hover over the integration to view a tooltip that shows the status:
The Tooling for Apache Camel K extension shows a status bar message for the following events:
Starting a new integration
Removing an integration
Refreshing the integrations view
Starting to follow an integration log
Starting a local Kubernetes proxy instance
Optionally, to disable status bar messages:
From the VS Code IDE, select File->Preferences->Settings.
Select Extensions and then select Apache Camel K Tooling Extension Settings.
Uncheck the Show Status Bar Messages option.
Viewing the log for a Apache Camel K Operator
In the background of each Apache Camel K system, there is an Operator coordinating the various builders and integrations being spun up. This log will often contain information not found in the integration log, including kit builder details. (See Viewing the running log below for details on opening the integration log.)
A new view opens. It is named for the running Kubernetes pod where the Operator is running. This log updates as new data is added.
Viewing the running log for a published Apache Camel K Integration
If you are running an integration in Dev mode, you can view the logged output for that integration in the Apache Camel K Output channel.
If you want to explicitly view the running log for a published integration in a new Log view, right-click on a running integration and then select the Follow log for running Apache Camel K Integration option.
A new view opens. It is named for the running Kubernetes pod where the integration is running. This log updates as new data is added:
...
},
"properties": {
...
}
}]
}
It is possible to use dashed notation in properties file and Camel K modelines. By default, the completion is using the camel cased notation. It is using the dashed notation when there is another Camel property already using dashed notation in the same file.
For detailed information about Apache Camel supported features, see the Language Server GitHub page.

How to install
You can download this Language Support for Apache Camel extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel.
After you install VS Code, follow these steps:
In VS Code, select View > Extensions.
Search for Camel.
Select the Language Support for Apache Camel option and then click Install.
Requirements for using this extension
After you install this Language Support for Apache Camel extension, follow these guidelines to access its features:
GitHub - apache/camel-k: Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration platform, born on Kubernetes, with serverless superpowers
Note: By default, Auto-scroll is checked and new entries in the log will automatically be scrolled to at the bottom of the window. If turned off, the scrolling stops and can be done manually.
Stopping an Apache Camel K integration
From the Apache Camel K Integrations view, right-click the integration that you want to stop.
Select Remove Apache Camel K Integration.
Java language support
To benefit from Java Language completion on standalone files, VS Code Language support for java needs to be installed. An invisible project is created with a default classpath.
The command Refresh local Java classpath for Camel K standalone file based on current editor. Available with kamel 1.4+. allows to have specfic dependencies of the opened Integration part of the classpath. For isntance, specific dependencies can be decalred as modeline.
Be aware of the following limitations:
It requires Camel K 1.4.0
If mistakenly called with Camel K 1.3.2-, need to restart VS Code for basic dependencies to be available again.
It supports modeline dependencies notation from local build. See apache/camel-k#2213
A single classpath is provided. It means that refresh command needs to be called when switching between Integration file written in Java that does not have the same dependencies.
There is no progress indicator. Please be patient. The first time may take several minutes on a slow network.
To benefit from Java debug on standalone files, VS Code Debugger for Java needs to be installed. To leverage it, you need to start an integration, then there are 2 solutions:
Right-click on integration in Integrations view, then choose Start Java debugger on Camel K integration.
Launch a camel-k-debug VS Code tasks and then to launch a java attach in debug VS Code tasks.
Apache Camel K Extension Settings
To access Tooling for Apache Camel K extension settings:
For an XML DSL file:
Use an .xml file extension.
Specify the Camel namespace http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint or http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring.
For a Java DSL file:
Use a .java file extension.
Specify Camel (usually from an imported package).
For example: import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder
To reference the Camel component, use from or to and a string without a space. The string cannot be a variable. For example, from("timer:timerName") works but from( "timer:timerName") and from(aVariable) do not work.

From the VS Code IDE, select File->Preferences->Settings.
Select Extensions and then select Apache Camel K Tooling Extension Settings.
Settings include:
Close Log View When Integration Removed - Indicates whether an open Log view for a published integration should be closed if the integration is removed (stopped). Defaults to true (checked). If unchecked, the Log will remain open and indicate that the integration has been stopped in the title bar.
Show Status Bar Messages - Indicates whether to show messages in the status bar to indicate when the system is updating, such as when the Camel K Integrations view is being refreshed or a new Integration is being deployed.
Namespace - The namespace to be used for all Apache Camel K and Kubernetes operations. This defaults to default but can be set to whatever your namespace has been configured to in your runtime. When it is updated, the Apache Camel K Integrations view is refreshed automatically. (See Changing the Namespace below for a bit more detail.)
Your First Integration
After your Apache Camel K/Minikube environment is running and you have installed the Tooling for Apache Camel K (vscode-camelk) extension, you can quickly start your first integration.
Create a directory on your development system called integrations. For example, /home/(User_Name)/Documents/integrations on Linux or C:\Users(User_Name)\Documents\integrations on Windows.
Download the simple.groovy file (https://github.com/apache/camel-k/blob/master/examples/simple.groovy) into your new integrations directory.
Start a new workspace in your VS Code Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Add the folder from step 1 to your new workspace with File->Add Folder to Workspace...
Right-click on simple.groovy in your directory and select Start Apache Camel K Integration.
Select Dev Mode - Apache Camel K Integration in Dev Mode.
Watch as messages appear in the Apache Camel K Output channel as your integration begins to run.
Open simple.groovy and update the message to say ‘This is my first Camel K Integration!’. Save the file with File->Save or Ctrl+S.
Watch as your integration is updated and your new message begins to appear in the output channel.
Changing the Namespace
Updating the Namespace setting (see Apache Camel K Extension Settings) changes the default namespace that the Apache Camel K and Kubernetes CLIs use when referencing the running system. By default, the namespace is set to the system default when the field is blank, but depending on your system you may change it to some other namespace.

It’s called dev mode. Differently from other frameworks, artifacts generated by Camel K in dev mode are no different from the one you run in production. Dev mode is just a helper to let you be quicker during development. To enable dev mode, just add the --dev flag when running the integration: kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev The --dev flag deploys immediately the integration and shows the integration logs in the console. You can then change the code and see the changes automatically applied (instantly) to the remote integration pod. The console follows automatically all redeploys of the integration. Here’s an example of the output: $ kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev

When you hover over a published integration and the namespace setting is set, you can now see what namespace is being used to populate the Apache Camel K Integrations view.
And if there are no published integrations available, you may see a message in the Apache Camel K output channel such as "Refreshing Apache Camel K Integrations view succeeded, no published integrations available for namespace mynamespace."
If any change is made to the namespace setting, the view will refresh accordingly.

.to("seda:output") Since the integration has a endpoint starting with the "imap:" prefix, Camel K is able to automatically add the "camel-mail" component to the list of required dependencies. The seda: endpoint belongs to camel-core that is automatically added to all integrations, so Camel K will not add additional dependencies for it. This dependency resolution mechanism is transparent to the user, that will just see the integration running. Automatic resolution is also a nice feature in dev mode, because you are allowed to add all components you need without exiting the dev loop. You can explicitly add dependency explicitly using the -d flag. This is useful when you need to use dependencies that are not included in the Camel catalog. For example: kamel run -d mvn:com.google.guava:guava:26.0-jre -d camel-mina2 Integration.java This feature can also be disabled if needed (although we discourage you from doing it) by disabling the dependencies trait (-t dependencies.enabled=false).

Getting Started
Camel K allows to run integrations directly on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
To use it, you need to be connected to a cloud environment or to a local cluster created for development purposes.
If you need help on how to create a local development environment based on Minishift or Minikube, you can follow the local cluster setup guide.

Installation
Make sure you apply specific configuration settings for your cluster before installing Camel K. Customized instructions are needed for
the following cluster types:
Minikube
Minishift
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
OpenShift
IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS)
Other cluster types (such as OpenShift clusters) should not need prior configuration.
To start using Camel K you need the "kamel" binary, that can be used to both configure the cluster and run integrations.
Look into the release page for latest version of the kamel tool.
If you want to contribute, you can also build it from source! Refer to the contributing guide
for information on how to do it.
Once you have the "kamel" binary, log into your cluster using the standard "oc" (OpenShift) or "kubectl" (Kubernetes) client tool and execute the following command to install Camel K:
kamel install
This will configure the cluster with the Camel K custom resource definitions and install the operator on the current namespace.
Important
Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) are cluster-wide objects and you need admin rights to install them. Fortunately this
operation can be done once per cluster. So, if the kamel install operation fails, you’ll be asked to repeat it when logged as admin.

kamel local build doesn't support same dependency notation which implies that some Cael k integration files are nto working in both context. it also implies that tooling cannot generate dependencies for all files.
for instance, using modeline // camel-k: dependency=camel-amqp is not working for kamel local build
On hover, the documentation of the Camel component is available.
Diagnostics (a.k.a. Validation) on Camel URI with XML DSL
On save, diagnostics on Camel URIs are updated:
Camel K modeline support
Completion for:
option names
trait definition names
trait property names
Camel artifact id for dependency
mvn dependency
Camel component properties
resource-like properties (resource, open-api, property-file). It is providing relevant sibling files filtering out some IDEs configuration folders (.vscode, .settings, .theia).
WebSocket support
Connection through WebSocket is supported. The server needs to be launched with --websocket option.
The following extra parameters can be used:
--port=<port>, default value is 8025
--hostname=<hostname>, default value localhost
--contextPath=<contextPath>, default value /. It must start with a /.

For Minishift, this means executing oc login -u system:admin then kamel install --cluster-setup only for first-time installation.
Running an Integration
After the initial setup, you can run a Camel integration on the cluster by executing:
kamel run examples/languages/Sample.java
During your first run you may see your console stuck with the following message:
integration "sample" created
integration "sample" in phase Waiting For Platform
Note
It will take some time for your integration to get started for the first time. This is because the camel-k operator has to pull and cache the camel-k builder images into the cluster’s registry.
You can follow this process by watching the pods in the namespace where the operator is running:
kubectl get pods -w
You should see something like:
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
camel-k-cache 0/1 Completed 0 3m29s
camel-k-groovy-builder 1/1 Running 0 32s

error raised:

WIP FUSETOOLS2-826 - add dependencies in classpath
…
a648c01
provide command to add dependencies on classpath.
todo:
- continue to handle 1.3-
- report error of the command downloading dependencies
- rename or change flow to allow cleaning the internal folder
Then, the connection can be made through
ws://<hostname>:<port><contextPath>/camel-language-server.
For information, with all defaults, it is ws://localhost:8025/camel-language-server.
Specific version of Camel catalog
It is possible to specify a specific version of the Camel catalog. This can be provided as Initialization Option or Workspace Configuration. The format is the same for both:
{
"camel": {
"Camel catalog version" : ...
}
}
To use Red Hat Integration productized version, the Red Hat Maven GA repository needs to be configured on the host running the Camel Language Server. To configure it, follow these steps:
Copy the default grape config file corresponding to the version used by Camel into ~/.groovy folder and call it grapeConfig.xml
Add <ibiblio name="fuse" m2compatible="true" root="https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/"/> inside the chain node
For more information, check the Grape official documentation.
Specific runtime provider of Camel catalog
It is possible to specify a specific runtime provider of the Camel catalog. This can be provided as Initialization Option or Workspace Configuration. The format is the same for both:
{
"camel": {
"Camel catalog runtime provider" : ...

- wait for 1.4.0 release and remove the maven snapshot repository used
for next iterations:
- automatically call refresh
- use an API to refresh the classpath to avoid workaround of changing
back and forth the settings
- use a specific folder per file
- find a way to support two files opened at same time in different
window which are not sharing the same dependencies
- allow to configure parameters to provide to the call (like a maven
repository)
limitations due to upstream:
- some notations not supported

Currently supported providers can be found in CamelRuntimeProvider enum.
Additional Camel components
It is possible to specify a list of additional Camel components. This can be provided as Initialization Option or Workspace Configuration. The format is the same for both:
{
"camel": {
"extra-components" : [

]
}
}
Document symbol support
There is document symbol for Camel Contexts and routes, on XML and Java DSL. In UI, for instance with VS Code, it means there are an outline, a breadcrumb and a Go To Document Symbol command.
Connected mode completion for Kafka component
When using the Camel Kafka component, the list of topics is dynamically retrieved from the Kafka Broker when available. By default, it tries to connect to localhost:9092. To connect to another instance, a setting can be provided, following this pattern:
{
"camel": {
"Kafka Connection URL" : "localhost:9092"

A "Sample.java" file is included in the /examples folder of this repository. You can change the content of the file and execute the command again to see the changes.
Configure Integration properties
Properties associated to an integration can be configured either using a ConfigMap/Secret or by setting using the "--property" flag, i.e.
kamel run --property my.message=test examples/props.js
kamel run --configmap=<your name here> examples/props.js
Note: to create the config map first create a file called application.properties which contains lines with key=value pairs
e.g. my.message="The text to display"
Create the config map in the usual manner e.g.
kubectl create configmap <your name here> --from-file=application.properties
Configure Integration Logging
camel-k runtime uses log4j2 as logging framework and can be configured through integration properties.
If you need to change the logging level of various loggers, you can do so by using the logging.level prefix:
logging.level.org.apache.camel = DEBUG
Configure Integration Components
camel-k component can be configured programmatically inside an integration or using properties with the following syntax.
As example if you want to change the queue size of the seda component, you can use the following property:
camel.component.seda.queueSize = 10

@apupier, @lhein I'm thinking about Apache Camel LSP project management and I'm wondering if we plan to work in sprints (fixed release cycles) or "once we have something we will make a release"? It will help me to draft an initial workflow how to manage the whole project on GitHub
Lars Heinemann
@lhein
for now we did not follow sprints or fixed cycles
whenever we felt there are enough new features we cut a release
Tomáš Sedmík
@tsedmik
@lhein ok, that's what I thought and that's IMHO most reasonable way to go for now :-)
Aurélien Pupier
@apupier
@davsclaus Hello Claus. is it possible to include Tomas and Dominik Jelinek in the member of Camel Tooling organization please? (or give me rigth to do it)
Tomas will create a board to better manage the LSP work in github directly and start having some QE applied on it (and soon documentation)
Claus Ibsen
@davsclaus
@apupier yeah sure
@apupier you and @lhein are now also owners so you ought to have admin rights
Aurélien Pupier
@apupier
thanks!
It’s possible to mount persistent volumes into integration containers by using the -v or --volume flag. The format of volume flag value is similar to that of the docker CLI. But instead of specifying a host path to mount from, you reference the name of a PersistentVolumeClaim that you have already configured within the cluster. E.g
kamel run examples/Sample.java -v myPvcName:/some/path
Configure Environment Variables
It’s possible to configure environment variables for integration containers by using the -e or --env flag:
kamel run examples/Sample.java -e MY_ENV_VAR=some-value
Running Integrations in "Dev" Mode for Fast Feedback
If you want to iterate quickly on an integration to have fast feedback on the code you’re writing, you can use by running it in "dev" mode:
kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev
The --dev flag deploys immediately the integration and shows the integration logs in the console. You can then change the code and see
the changes automatically applied (instantly) to the remote integration pod.
The console follows automatically all redeploys of the integration.
Here’s an example of the output:
[nferraro@localhost camel-k]$ kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev
integration "sample" created
integration "sample" in phase Building
integration "sample" in phase Deploying
integration "sample" in phase Running

todo:
- wait for 1.4.0 release and remove the maven snapshot repository used
for next iterations:
- automatically call refresh when needed (to be determined when it is
needed)
- use an API to refresh the classpath to avoid workaround of changing
back and forth the settings
- use a specific folder per file
- find a way to support two files opened at same time in different
window which are not sharing the same dependencies
- allow to configure parameters to provide to the call (like a maven
repository)

Hover on Camel URI with XML DSL
On hover, the documentation of the Camel component is available.
Diagnostics (a.k.a. Validation) on Camel URI with XML DSL
On save, diagnostics on Camel URIs are updated:
Camel K modeline support
Completion for:
option names
trait definition names
trait property names
Camel artifact id for dependency
mvn dependency
Camel component properties
resource-like properties (resource, open-api, property-file). It is providing relevant sibling files filtering out some IDEs configuration folders (.vscode, .settings, .theia).
WebSocket support
Connection through WebSocket is supported. The server needs to be launched with --websocket option.
The following extra parameters can be used:
--port=<port>, default value is 8025
--hostname=<hostname>, default value localhost
--contextPath=<contextPath>, default value /. It must start with a /.
Then, the connection can be made through
ws://<hostname>:<port><contextPath>/camel-language-server.
For information, with all defaults, it is ws://localhost:8025/camel-language-server.

@tsedmik
@apupier Hi Aurelien, I've noticed, that you've started playing with project boards :-)
@apupier I believe, that we need to set some guidelines and rules how to work with it
for example:
every PR is related to some issue and the issue is mentioned in the PR (for example: camel-tooling/camel-language-server#130)
in Project Boards we operate only with issues (not PRs)
...
Tomáš Sedmík
@tsedmik
Hi @apupier, @lhein, could you get me some tips or hints how to test Apache Camel LSP locally - to be able verify resolved issues? What is your workflow in development phase?
Aurélien Pupier
@apupier
I launch a maven build on the language server project to have the fat jar genrated in target folder
then I copy it to the libs folder of LSP eclipse client (the best is to launch a maven build which will copy it automatically but it takes more time. Fo rthe first time it can ensure you to find the correct place)
than launch an Eclispe instance with the LSP eclipse client project (I hink this one yyou know how to do)
to test on VS code, i copy the fat jar to jars folder of vscode client.
to launch it, you need to open the vs code client project in VS Code, then you shoudl have a Debug -> Start Debugging available
you can even choose to launch the test suite or a vs code instance with Apache Camel LSP
Aurélien Pupier
@apupier
to verify already resolved issues, you can also use the Eclipse LSP update site/marketplace as it is automatically pushed
Tomáš Sedmík
[1] [INFO ] 2018-09-20 21:24:36.820 [main] DefaultCamelContext - Apache Camel 2.22.1 (CamelContext: camel-1) started in 0.314 seconds
Dependencies and Component Resolution
Camel components used in an integration are automatically resolved. For example, take the following integration:
from("imap://admin@myserver.com")
.to("seda:output")
Since the integration is using the "imap:" prefix, Camel K is able to automatically add the "camel-mail" component to the list of required dependencies.
This will be transparent to the user, that will just see the integration running.
Automatic resolution is also a nice feature in --dev mode, because you are allowed to add all components you need without exiting the dev loop.
You can also use the -d flag to pass additional explicit dependencies to the Camel client tool:
kamel run -d mvn:com.google.guava:guava:26.0-jre -d camel-mina2 Integration.java
Not Just Java
Camel K supports multiple languages for writing integrations:
Table 1. Languages
Language
Description
Java
Integrations written in Java DSL are supported.
XML
Integrations written in plain XML DSL are supported (Spring XML with <beans> or Blueprint XML with <blueprint> not supported).
YAML
Integrations written in YAML DSL are supported.
Groovy
Groovy .groovy files are supported (experimental).
JavaScript
- provide progress report of refresh
- write test to handle 1.3- (or not and consider it as no more supported
and keep code for now as best-effort)

WIP FUSETOOLS2-826 - add dependencies in classpath
Specific version of Camel catalog
It is possible to specify a specific version of the Camel catalog. This can be provided as Initialization Option or Workspace Configuration. The format is the same for both:
{
"camel": {
"Camel catalog version" : ...
}
}
To use Red Hat Integration productized version, the Red Hat Maven GA repository needs to be configured on the host running the Camel Language Server. To configure it, follow these steps:
Copy the default grape config file corresponding to the version used by Camel into ~/.groovy folder and call it grapeConfig.xml
Add <ibiblio name="fuse" m2compatible="true" root="https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/"/> inside the chain node
For more information, check the Grape official documentation.
Specific runtime provider of Camel catalog
It is possible to specify a specific runtime provider of the Camel catalog. This can be provided as Initialization Option or Workspace Configuration. The format is the same for both:
{
"camel": {
"Camel catalog runtime provider" : ...
}
}
@tsedmik

JavaScript .js files are supported (experimental).
Kotlin
Kotlin Script .kts files are supported (experimental).
More information about supported languages is provided in the languages guide.
Integrations written in different languages are provided in the examples directory.
An example of integration written in JavaScript is the /examples/dns.js integration.
Here’s the content:
// Lookup every second the 'www.google.com' domain name and log the output
from('timer:dns?period=1000')
.routeId('dns')
.setHeader('dns.domain')
.constant('www.google.com')
.to('dns:ip')
.to('log:dns');
To run it, you need just to execute:
kamel run examples/dns.js
Traits
The details of how the integration is mapped into Kubernetes resources can be customized using traits.
More information is provided in the traits section.

Document symbol support
There is document symbol for Camel Contexts and routes, on XML and Java DSL. In UI, for instance with VS Code, it means there are an outline, a breadcrumb and a Go To Document Symbol command.
Connected mode completion for Kafka component
When using the Camel Kafka component, the list of topics is dynamically retrieved from the Kafka Broker when available. By default, it tries to connect to localhost:9092. To connect to another instance, a setting can be provided, following this pattern:
{
"camel": {
"Kafka Connection URL" : "localhost:9092"

@apupier
never seen this error but I know that other IDEs than Eclipse are not good for automatic building so I often needs to call npm install
or install required dependices from a right-click menu in VS Code
I don' tknow exactly when it is needed for now
install depdencies is on right-click on package.json file
@tsedmik so usually I invoke this install depdencies, then try to call npm install in the terminal that has been opened and then retry to "debug" the application
Tomáš Sedmík
@tsedmik
@apupier ok, I'll try it. Thank you for the tip ;-)
Tomáš Sedmík
@tsedmik
@apupier "Install dependencies" on "package.json" helps. But I had to manually install "mvn-artifact-download" -> npm install --save mvn-artifact-download
otherwise "Install dependencies" fails with error that "mvn-artifact-download" cannot be installed

@davsclaus Hello, I've a bunch of camel projects with Java DSL but in kotlin files. The projects are kotlin based Spring boot projects. Is there anyway the IntelliJ Idea Camel plugin be used on these projects.
Claus Ibsen
@davsclaus
@RajaJeevagan no the IDEA plugin is for Java and XML only. An earlier version did had some initial support for Kotlin, but I think we have removed that in the newest versions - it was at that time too much to handle for us as we develop this plugin in our spare time
The plugins that @apupier works on is using LSP which is a standard that many other IDEs are adding/has support for, and thus it works in more editors. IDEA dont yet have out of the box suppport for LSP

OpenShift does not always provide full cluster-admin rights to all users, so you may need to contact an administrator to install the Kubernetes custom resources and roles needed by Camel K. You need to get the kamel CLI (camel-k-client) tool the from release page and put it on your system path (e.g. on /usr/bin/kamel on Linux). To install the custom resource definitions and related roles, just execute (with cluster-admin role): kamel install --cluster-setup Once you’ve done this only once per the whole cluster, you can login as a standard user and continue with the standard Camel K installation procedure.

Make sure you’ve selected a version of Kubernetes greater than 1.11 when creating the cluster. You can create it in any region. In the list of clusters for the current project, GKE provides a connection string that you need to execute on a shell to configure the kubectl command. the connection string contains a --project flag that indicates your project ID. You should keep that information for the last step. After executing the connection string, if everything is installed correctly, you should be able to execute: kubectl get pod When the cluster is first installed, you should find that "no pods are present" in the cluster. You can proceed with the installation then. Before installing Camel K on a fresh GKE cluster, you need to perform some extra steps to give to your account the required cluster-admin permissions. This means executing the following command (replacing "your-address@gmail.com" with your account email address): kubectl create clusterrolebinding user-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=your-address@gmail.com The command above is needed to make sure your user is able to delegate some permissions to Camel K service accounts. You can now get the kamel CLI tool the from release page and put it on your system path. The last thing to do is to configure gcr.io as registry to host your integration image. After doing that, you’ll be ready to play with Camel K. Enjoy!

oc scale deployment/camel-k-operator --replicas 0 You can scale it back to 1 when you’re done, and you have updated the operator image. You can set up the IDE (e.g. Goland) to execute the /cmd/manager/main.go file in debug mode with operator as the argument. When configuring the IDE task, make sure to add all required environment variables in the IDE task configuration screen: Set the KUBERNETES_CONFIG environment variable to point to your Kubernetes configuration file (usually <homedir>/.kube/config). Set the WATCH_NAMESPACE environment variable to a Kubernetes namespace you have access to. Set the OPERATOR_NAME environment variable to camel-k. After you set up the IDE task, with Java 11+ to be used by default, you can run and debug the operator process. The operator can be fully debugged in Minishift, because it uses OpenShift S2I binary builds under the hood. The build phase cannot be (currently) debugged in Minikube because the Kaniko builder requires that the operator and the publisher pod share a common persistent volume. Building Metadata for Publishing the Operator in Operator Hub Publishing to an operator hub requires creation and submission of metadata, required in a specific format. The operator-sdk provides tools to help with the creation of this metadata. There are two formats for the publishing of the metadata: Package Manifests The legacy packaging format used for deploying the operator to an OLM registry. While deprecated in Openshift 4.5+, it is still supported and used on that and other cluster types. A single CSV is generated, comprising of the operator CRDs, and additional files. All versions of the operator metadata are located into a single directory. To generate the metadata for camel-k in the legacy format, use the following command: make build-olm The CSV and accompanying files are located in deploy/olm-catalog. These files are under version control. bundles The latest packaging format used for deploying the operator to an OLM registry. This generates a CSV and related metadata files in a directory named bundle. The directory contains a Dockerfile that allows for building the bundle into a single image. It is this image that is submitted to the OLM registry. To generate the bundle for camel-k, use the following command: make bundle The bundle directory is created at the root of the camel-k project filesystem.

To use it, you need to be connected to a cloud environment or to a local cluster created for development purposes. Requirements Camel K installation is usually straightforward, but for certain cluster types you need to apply specific configuration settings before installing it. Customized instructions are needed for the following cluster types: Minikube Minishift Red Hat CodeReady Containers (CRC) Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) OpenShift IBM Kubernetes Services (IKS) K3s Kind Other cluster types (such as OpenShift clusters) should not need prior configuration. Procedure To start using Camel K you need the "kamel" CLI tool, that can be used to both configure the cluster and run integrations. Look into the release page for the latest version of the camel-k-client tool for your specific platform. Download and uncompress the archive. It contains a small binary file named kamel that you should put into your system path. For example, if you’re using Linux, you can put kamel in /usr/bin. Once you have put the "kamel" CLI in the path, log into your cluster using the standard "oc" (OpenShift) or "kubectl" (Kubernetes) client tool and execute the following command to install Camel K: kamel install This will configure the cluster with the Camel K custom resource definitions and install the operator on the current namespace. Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) are cluster-wide objects and you need admin rights to install them. Fortunately, this operation can be done once per cluster. So, if the kamel install operation fails, you’ll be asked to repeat it when logged as admin. For Minishift, this means executing oc login -u system:admin then kamel install --cluster-setup only for the first-time installation. You’re now ready to run some integrations.

Any updates on this issue? Camel-salesforce-kafka-connector is completely broken. I use it with the official Confluent Platform Kafka Connect Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect-base). The connector doesn't work at all, without downloading the jetty-http jar. I can confirm that it is reproducible for all versions starting from 0.7.0 (I tried 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 0.7.3, 0.8.0, 0.9.0).
Without downloading the jar, the connector starts but doesn't process any messages and there are no errors in the output. Enabling the DEBUG logging for org.eclipse.jetty.client package uncovers the errors that are happening silently:
java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving method 'void org.eclipse.jetty.http.GZIPContentDecoder.<init>(org.eclipse.jetty.io.ByteBufferPool, int)'
the class loader org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.PluginClassLoader @1dd6d4b7 of the current class,
org/eclipse/jetty/client/GZIPContentDecoder, and the class loader 'app' for the method's defining class,
org/eclipse/jetty/http/GZIPContentDecoder, have different Class objects for the type
org/eclipse/jetty/io/ByteBufferPool used in the signature (org.eclipse.jetty.client.GZIPContentDecoder is in
unnamed module of loader org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.PluginClassLoader @1dd6d4b7, parent
loader org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.DelegatingClassLoader @62e7f11d;

yeah, this is how I do it now. Looks like the issue was introduced with this commit: orpiske@1ccb1ce
There is a chance, that the current issue only happens when you use Confluent's docker image. (otherwise, I don't have an idea how the connector can be broken for such a long period of time).
So, currently, I'm not sure about the best way to fix this.

We have an integration tests for salesforce using pure Kafka connect and we didn't catch any problem. Do you happen to know what is the jetty version used by Confluent's docker image?

We have an integration tests for salesforce using pure Kafka connect and we didn't catch any problem. Do you happen to know what is the jetty version used by Confluent's docker image?
The latest image from confluent seems to be using jetty-http-9.4.38.v20210224.jar in their cp-kafka container.

BTW, the offending commit references issue #407, but it is actually issue #807 that was fixed by it (and that seems to have caused this).

@valdar @oscerd given the original issue was a conflict between the jetty from Salesforce and the one from Kafka, I believe we can try removing that exclusion. Versions from each of them seem quite close.

[[getting-started]]
== Getting Started
Camel K allows to run integrations directly on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
To use it, you need to be connected to a cloud environment or to a local cluster created for development purposes.
If you need help on how to create a local development environment based on *Minishift* or *Minikube*, you can follow the https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/installation.html[local cluster setup guide].
[[installation]]
=== Installation
Make sure you apply specific configuration settings for your cluster before installing Camel K. Customized instructions are needed for
the following cluster types:
- https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/minikube.html[Minikube]
- https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/minishift.html[Minishift]
- https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/gke.html[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)]
- https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/openshift.html[OpenShift]
- https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/iks.html[IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS)]
Other cluster types (such as OpenShift clusters) should not need prior configuration.
To start using Camel K you need the **"kamel"** binary, that can be used to both configure the cluster and run integrations.
Look into the https://github.com/apache/camel-k/releases[release page] for latest version of the `kamel` tool.

If you want to contribute, you can also **build it from source!** Refer to the https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/contributing/developers.html[contributing guide]
for information on how to do it.
Once you have the "kamel" binary, log into your cluster using the standard "oc" (OpenShift) or "kubectl" (Kubernetes) client tool and execute the following command to install Camel K:
```
kamel install
```
This will configure the cluster with the Camel K custom resource definitions and install the operator on the current namespace.
IMPORTANT: Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) are cluster-wide objects and you need admin rights to install them. Fortunately this
operation can be done *once per cluster*. So, if the `kamel install` operation fails, you'll be asked to repeat it when logged as admin.
For Minishift, this means executing `oc login -u system:admin` then `kamel install --cluster-setup` only for first-time installation.
=== Running an Integration
After the initial setup, you can run a Camel integration on the cluster by executing:
```
kamel run examples/Sample.java
```
During your first run you may see your console stuck with the following message:
```
integration "sample" created
integration "sample" in phase Waiting For Platform
```
NOTE: It will take some time for your integration to get started for the first time. This is because the camel-k operator has to pull and cache the camel-k builder images into the cluster's registry.
You can follow this process by watching the pods in the namespace where the operator is running:
```
kubectl get pods -w
```
You should see something like:

Never mind ^ was on v 0.10. With your snapshot I get a different error now and does not silently fail. I'll investigate that separately.

The salesforce connector depends on Jetty 9.4.35.v20201120, but Kafka Connect uses 9.4.24.v20191120. Their ABIs are not compatible and causes problems such as the one below when trying to run the connector.
java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found interface org.eclipse.jetty.http.pathmap.PathSpec, but class was expected
We need to exclude org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http on the connector dependencies. This seems to be sufficient for the tests to work, but it's hard to guarantee that it will work 100%.
The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:

==== Configure Integration properties
Properties associated to an integration can be configured either using a ConfigMap/Secret or by setting using the "--property" flag, i.e.
```
kamel run --property my.message=test examples/props.js
```
```
kamel run --configmap=<your name here> examples/props.js
```
Note: to create the config map first create a file called application.properties which contains lines with key=value pairs

e.g. my.message="The text to display"
Create the config map in the usual manner e.g.
```
kubectl create configmap <your name here> --from-file=application.properties
```
==== Configure Integration Logging
camel-k runtime uses log4j2 as logging framework and can be configured through integration properties.
If you need to change the logging level of various loggers, you can do so by using the `logging.level` prefix:
```
logging.level.org.apache.camel = DEBUG
```
==== Configure Integration Components
camel-k component can be configured programmatically inside an integration or using properties with the following syntax.
```
```
As example if you want to change the queue size of the seda component, you can use the following property:
```
camel.component.seda.queueSize = 10
```
==== Configure Integration Volumes
It's possible to mount persistent volumes into integration containers by using the `-v` or `--volume` flag. The format of volume flag value is similar to that of the docker CLI. But instead of specifying a host path to mount from, you reference the name of a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that you have already configured within the cluster. E.g
```
kamel run examples/Sample.java -v myPvcName:/some/path
```
==== Configure Environment Variables

It's possible to configure environment variables for integration containers by using the `-e` or `--env` flag:
```
kamel run examples/Sample.java -e MY_ENV_VAR=some-value
```
=== Running Integrations in "Dev" Mode for Fast Feedback
If you want to iterate quickly on an integration to have fast feedback on the code you're writing, you can use by running it in **"dev" mode**:
```
kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev
```
The `--dev` flag deploys immediately the integration and shows the integration logs in the console. You can then change the code and see
the **changes automatically applied (instantly)** to the remote integration pod.
The console follows automatically all redeploys of the integration.
Here's an example of the output:
```
[nferraro@localhost camel-k]$ kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev
integration "sample" created
integration "sample" in phase Building
integration "sample" in phase Deploying
integration "sample" in phase Running

from("imap://admin@myserver.com")
.to("seda:output")
```
Since the integration is using the **"imap:" prefix**, Camel K is able to **automatically add the "camel-mail" component** to the list of required dependencies.
This will be transparent to the user, that will just see the integration running.
Automatic resolution is also a nice feature in `--dev` mode, because you are allowed to add all components you need without exiting the dev loop.
You can also use the `-d` flag to pass additional explicit dependencies to the Camel client tool:
```
kamel run -d mvn:com.google.guava:guava:26.0-jre -d camel-mina2 Integration.java
```
=== Not Just Java
Camel K supports multiple languages for writing integrations:
.Languages
[options="header"]
|=======================
| Language | Description
| Java | Integrations written in Java DSL are supported.
| XML | Integrations written in plain XML DSL are supported (Spring XML with <beans> or Blueprint XML with <blueprint> not supported).
| YAML | Integrations written in YAML DSL are supported.
| Groovy | Groovy `.groovy` files are supported (experimental).
| JavaScript | JavaScript `.js` files are supported (experimental).
| Kotlin | Kotlin Script `.kts` files are supported (experimental).
|=======================
More information about supported languages is provided in the https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/languages/languages.html[languages guide].
Integrations written in different languages are provided in the link:/examples[examples] directory.
An example of integration written in JavaScript is the link:/examples/dns.js[/examples/dns.js] integration.

Here's the content:
```
// Lookup every second the 'www.google.com' domain name and log the output
from('timer:dns?period=1000')
.routeId('dns')
.setHeader('dns.domain')
.constant('www.google.com')
.to('dns:ip')
.to('log:dns');
```
To run it, you need just to execute:
```
kamel run examples/dns.js
```
=== Traits
The details of how the integration is mapped into Kubernetes resources can be *customized using traits*.
More information is provided in the https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/traits/traits.html[traits section].
=== Monitoring the Status
Camel K integrations follow a lifecycle composed of several steps before getting into the `Running` state.
You can check the status of all integrations by executing the following command:
```

Using a simple Telegram Kamlet to receive CloudEvents in a Knative Service results in events that have the CloudEvent source attribute set to the Knative sink for the events.
For example, this Kamlet:
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
name: telegram-image-bot-source
spec:
source:
properties:
authorizationToken: "REDACTED"
ref:
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: Kamelet
name: telegram-source
sink:
ref:
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Broker
name: default

Produces this event:
Context Attributes,
specversion: 1.0
type: org.apache.camel.event
source: knative://endpoint/camel-event-display?apiVersion=serving.knative.dev%2Fv1&kind=Service
id: 049ACF1CAECA405-0000000000000009

Data,
{ ... }
Note that the source is pointing to the Knative event display instead of being a URI identifying the context in which the event occurred. https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#source-1
Also helpful would be to have the type be more finely grained. For example, org.apache.camel.event.kamlet.telegram.telegram-image-bot-source.

fix: Do not filter Camel catalogs by runtime provider label

Thos are likely the default values the camel-knative component sets when no other info are given, I think we need:
the camel-k operator to set some more meaningful values
the component to fail when no values are provided instead of falling back to internal defaults
@nicolaferraro what do you think ?

We should define a concept of global Kamelet, i.e. a general Kamelet that is not local to a specific namespace, but can be used from any namespace. By default (in the PR #1602), integrations can only use Kamelets contained in the same namespace.
Having global Kamelets can allow UI's built on Camel K to show "Sources" or "Sinks" available in the cluster that are ready for use.
When installing the operator, we can install by default some global Kamelets (defined in this repo or, in the future, in a "Kamelet hub") in a special namespace, so that graphical tools can pick them up.
The issue is where to put them:
A system namespace (like kube-system, openshift)? Seems not a standard approach
A camel-system namespace? Operator needs permissions to create that namespace and read kamelets from it (cluster-role)
Then we should:
Adapt the operator runtime to lookup that namespace and allow to use it: resolution will be first attempted on the local namespace, then on the global one
Install some global Kamelets automatically on installation (and keep them updated on new releases): initial set of kamelets can be picked from the examples provided in the https://github.com/apache/camel-k-examples repository for Knative sources

Fixes #1897.
This PR is intentionally minimal, to limit impacts of back porting it into the 1.3.x branch.
I'll create a follow-up PR to remove all the runtime provider related bits if no one objects.

The current behaviour of the camel-k operator is to looks for kamelets from k8s but to support different use cases, we should think about introducing a concept of kamelet repository. As example we can support:
to search kamelet on the local filesystem (@doru1004 FYI)
to search kamelet from an online kamelet catalog (github)
We should define a minimalistic API the operator can leverage to search and retrieve a kamelet.
There will be multiple implementation depending on the back-end.

there should not be any difference, but if you are off-line or access to a cluster, then you may need a way to resolves kamelet if it is in use in your integration wit kamel local run

Sounds good and I agree that there shouldn't be any difference in behavior. What I had in mind were two things:
(1) does the code describing the kamelet look different for a local kamelet vs. an online kamelet.
(2) could a kamelet run locally without Kubernetes being required.

no, the format should be the same
a kamelet alone can't run so it need to be put in a context: a kamelet binding or plain integration as any other endpoint so it should not make any difference if youa re on or off k8s (of course if the kamelet itself required k8s then it wont' work but that's expected)

Hi @tadayosi, the tests fail because the ServiceMonitor CRD is not installed:
error executing post actions: error during replace resource: could not create or replace resource java: no matches for kind \"ServiceMonitor\" in version \"monitoring.coreos.com/v1\"
It fails also on OpenShift 3.11 for the same reason. The -t prometheus.service-monitor=false option should probably be passed to the kamel run command.

@oscerd Why not? Isn't it just a place to put stuff? The examples I saw are basically just yaml or json documents. Take a look here: https://www.apicur.io/registry/docs/apicurio-registry/1.3.2.Final/assets-attachments/registry-rest-api.htm It goves you an idea of the data model.
At the moment the registry doesn't have any notion of Kamelets, but it could I guess. There are some interesting traits:
validation
rules that govern modifcations
versioning
metadata
I think all of these could be interesting to a registry that manages kamelets.

My main concern about the registry is related to the fact that we may need to provide a different strategy for the kamelets. I mean, in a schema registry, when you send a kafka record and you want to use a schema, you'll have to set a strategy to provide the id for that schema. Apicurio provides some strategies out of the box, but we may need to define our own strategy for the kamelets and I don't know where this strategy could live. But It may be I'm thinking about the schema registry as something only kafka-related...

Fixes #1824
The list of spec.configurations in the Integration ends up as volumes and volumeMounts in the Knative service. The ordering of these is determined by this package: https://github.com/scylladb/go-set
There is no ordering implied here, which is perfectly fine, except that Knative sees the order of the volumes and volume mounts as a change worthy of a new revision. When there are many configmaps and secrets in the integration, the number of additional revisions is quite large (50-60, sometimes more) and a new pod is generated for each one. Sorting the list before returning it ensures the ordering is consistent, and Knative will only generate a single revision.

@astefanutti Thanks for your feedback. I'm not certain what's really happening with the openshift integration test though, as the output log shows that it didn't run on OpenShift according to:
--- SKIP: TestPlatformlessRun (0.00s)
Error: platformless_run_test.go:41: This test is for OpenShift only and cannot work when a custom platform configuration is needed
So I have an impression that it's failing just due to #1848. It makes sense to add -t prometheus.service-monitor=false and suppress checking of ServiceMonitor creation for the time being but we may still see the same errors.

I think there might be an underlying issue with how CLI boolean properties get mapped into trait structs. So before we patch all the traits, let me find out why.

I don't think it matters at the moment, the main goal is to introduce the concept on camel-k side, like defining an minimalistic API the operator can leverage to search and retrieve a kamelet. There will be multiple implementation depending on the back-end.

It seems that go test -timeout 60m -v ./e2e/common/... -tags=integration does not print it's output in progress but it prits everything at the end of the test execution.
Travis CI seems to have an issue with it:
No output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.
Check the details on how to adjust your build configuration on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received
The build has been terminated
Should I change the command to go test -timeout 60m -v ./e2e/common -tags=integration && go test -timeout 60m -v ./e2e/common/languages -tags=integration? What do you thing about it?

This is the TestPlatformlessRun test.
So I have an impression that it's failing just due to #1848. It makes sense to add -t prometheus.service-monitor=false and suppress checking of ServiceMonitor creation for the time being but we may still see the same errors.
It fails also on OpenShift workflow, because that is OpenShift 3.11 and the Prometheus operator isn't installed OOTB, as opposed to OCP 4.

@astefanutti Ah you are right. I was confused on TestPlatformlessRun, where I thought it's skipped because ocp != true but it rather seems because needsExternalRepo != nil.
Let me try adding -t prometheus.service-monitor=false to see if we could remove the CI errors.

@astefanutti I spotted the underlying issue here. So as I understand it it's essentially how mapstructure handles bool struct properties when they are annotated with omitempty.
https://github.com/tadayosi/samples-go/blob/master/pkg/mapper/mapper_test.go
I thought that BaseTrait.Enabled is originally typed as *bool because the author already noticed the limitation when creating it. If that's true I think it's natural that we all follow the rule of using *bool for all bool trait props.

@tadayosi thanks. My understanding is that the issue occurs for boolean fields for which the traits constructor default the value to true. When such a field is set to false from the CLI, it is omitted in the integration JSON, then when the trait is initialised, the field is initialised to true and not overwritten by the trait configuration unmarshalling (as the field has been omitted). Note that mapstruct is not involved here. So, indeed, this is a typical case where using a *bool is required. An alternative would be to remove json:",omitempty", but that leak defaulting into user-space.

@oscerd Why not? Isn't it just a place to put stuff? The examples I saw are basically just yaml or json documents. Take a look here: apicur.io/registry/docs/apicurio-registry/1.3.2.Final/assets-attachments/registry-rest-api.htm It goves you an idea of the data model.
At the moment the registry doesn't have any notion of Kamelets, but it could I guess. There are some interesting traits:
* validation
* rules that govern modifcations
* versioning
* metadata
I think all of these could be interesting to a registry that manages kamelets.
I think it would technically be possible and as you mentioned it would offer some nice things like version and validation, however I wonder if it would be semantically correct as a kamelet defines both the signature (with a json schema and the schema for in/out data) as well as the implementation of the API itself.
FWIW, I think we have or at least we thought about having an option to use the registry to store the schemas associated to the kamelet.

I'd start with a Github interface for the operator/CLI and also create a new Kamelet repository on the apache org that can be contributed by the community, like apache/camel-kamelets.
At the moment, it would contain only the yaml definitions, so that the runtime can look them up automatically. But the same repo can later host also other artifacts that are linked to each kamelet, like UIs configurators and related meta services.
The same repository can be also the source of truth for a new section on the website where users can look for kamelets and configure them for their platform (e.g. to create a Knative source, or to download it as Camel-Kafka-connector).
Wdyt?

@nicolaferraro WDYT?
I was thinking about this but did not have time to look carefully.
I remember there was an issue in travis that happened when an execution did not produce any output for a long time. But don't know why this change triggers that issue.
This may be something completely silly, but I remember some issue about the ... notation here: https://github.com/apache/camel-k/pull/1822/files#diff-9aecbcc15d64c3e7a146ee5776a35e65b45fb72461e370c4e295dd90f6d45262R151
I remember a bug about that and maybe the go version in Travis is hitting that. Do you mind trying to run tests on explicit dirs or hack with versions?

Hmm, so it appears that what blocks the test now is #1848. It seems Prometheus trait doesn't deploy not only on k8s but also OCP 3.11.

Minikube doesn't have the Prometheus operator installed OOTB either, so it fails with the same error. The option to disable the creation of the ServiceMonitor should also be added on vanilla Kubernetes.

Assuming you add some dependencies using modeline, then if you amend them in dev mode, the integration does not reflect the new set of dependencies

That's bad, considering that dev mode was one of the target use cases for using modeline.

@astefanutti Ah yes, my comment was incorrect. It is not mapstructure but JSON marshalling as you explained. Thanks for your investigation.

Damn! The https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received is not working in the script that runs the integration test (https://travis-ci.com/github/apache/camel-k/builds/204584739). Then I would go with go test -timeout 60m -v ./e2e/common -tags=integration && go test -timeout 60m -v ./e2e/common/languages -tags=integration.

One more thing. In my test case affinity.pod-affinity=false is also covered which is by default false, so I don't think it's only an issue with the default value being true.

Let's postpone this to 1.2.x, so we can do a release based on Camel 3.4 and latest Camel-quarkus without forcing it as default.

@tadayosi ah right. I did not mention that in my review, as I already agree with the approach you've taken. I think that all the boolean fields should be declared as pointers, as even if the current default is false and it works, it's error prone if the default changes, and the user-provided value is not marshalled if it matches the default.

To be clear, the root cause is not whether the prop has a certain default value or not, but the way JSON marshalling handles "zero" primitive values when "omitempty" is added:
https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal
The "omitempty" option specifies that the field should be omitted from the encoding if the field has an empty value, defined as false, 0, a nil pointer, a nil interface value, and any empty array, slice, map, or string.
So theoretically every prop (including bool and even int) on a trait should be declared as a pointer really. In practice, however, in most cases int props shouldn't have issues so long as assigning 0 to the prop doesn't make sense.
Tomorrow I'll follow up with Antonin's suggestion of moving the defaulting logic to Configure.

After investigation I realised that it's not as easy as I initially thought. It's because each trait's Configure method is invoked after the trait catalog's configure has already been invoked, and it is where the trait is initialised with the trait configuration from an integration.

It's still possible to move the defaulting logic to Configure method but the logic would then require checking on each property whether it's already initialised with the value from an integration to make sure it wouldn't override already configured values, and I'd say it's more error-prone than the current code.

I'd suggest to create the following method into the util.go file and use it so that the structs initialisation can be inlined:
func BoolP(b bool) *bool {
return &b
}
For example, that would give:
return &affinityTrait{
BaseTrait: NewBaseTrait("affinity", 1300),
PodAffinity: BoolP(false),
PodAntiAffinity: BoolP(false),
}

schema:
id: text.camel.apache.org
type: string
flow:
from:
uri: timer:tick
steps:
- set-body:
constant: "Hello [here there'll be the message, but we need to define how to pass it in runtime] !!!"
- to: "log:info"
People can use the kamelet as in:
from('kamelet:timer')
.to('log:info')
But currently the kamelet component does not exist in runtime, so it would fail.
The user can optionally use a predefined configuration for the Kamelet:
from('kamelet:timer/mytimer')
.to('log:info')
In this case, all secrets labelled with camel.apache.org/kamelet=timer and camel.apache.org/kamelet.configuration=mytimer will be loaded automatically into the context. Properties inside the secret are expected to reference the mytimer kamelet (in a way that the runtime will define).

@tadayosi I see what you mean, that is convenient to keep the defaulting early in the trait struct creation.

Secrets with camel.apache.org/kamelet=timer and no configuration label will be also loaded into the context, to provide fallback configuration.
This mechanisms serves to create "instances" of a Kamelet, by providing a specific configuration (somewhere else called "connection") and will be useful for setting e.g. addresses and tokens for external systems.
The dir will contain two files for each Kamelet:
{name}.yaml (or another extension): contains the Kamelet route
{name}-schema.json: contains the json schema of the Kamelet configuration (spec -> definition field, converted into JSON)
All those files are also referenced in the default application.properties file. E.g. for timer:
application.properties
camel.k.kamelets[timer].schema=/etc/camel/kamelets.d/timer/timer-schema.json
camel.k.kamelets[timer].language=yaml
camel.k.kamelets[timer].location=file:/etc/camel/kamelets.d/timer/timer.yaml
Release Note
Kamelets (v1alpha1) have been added as new way to define reusable route fragments

@nicolaferraro do you have an example of a sinkbinding declaration with a regular integration?
@heiko-braun this is an (working) integration that results as a regular Knative source:
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration
metadata:
name: source
spec:
flows:
- from:
uri: timer:tick

I think we already discussed this but wonder if we can reference kamelets just like any other source since the beginning, something like:
camel.k.sources[0].name = Timer
camel.k.sources[0].language = yaml
camel.k.sources[0].location = file:/etc/camel/sources/timer/timer.yaml
camel.k.sources[0].type = template

You signed in with another tab or window. Reload to refresh your session.

camel.k.sources[0].schema = file:/etc/camel/sources/timer/timer-schema.json
so on the runtime side, we can always reason in term of sources and then create a template or a route depending on the type.
For backward compatibility, setting the routes using the env vars as today will be supported for some time.

Thinking a little bit more, we can get rid of the schema as loading it is heavy and we only need to know the list of properties the kamelet supports, like:
camel.k.sources[0].name = timer
camel.k.sources[0].language = yaml
camel.k.sources[0].location = file:/etc/camel/sources/timer/timer.yaml
camel.k.sources[0].type = template
camel.k.sources[0].properties-names[0] = a
camel.k.sources[0].properties-names[1] = b
camel.k.sources[0].properties-names[2] = c
or
camel.k.sources[0].name = timer
camel.k.sources[0].language = yaml
camel.k.sources[0].location = file:/etc/camel/sources/timer/timer.yaml
camel.k.sources[0].type = template
camel.k.sources[0].properties-names = a,b,c
then if any of the property has a default value, that value can be added to the list of initial properties so assuming the property a has a default value of foo, then the operator should generate a property like:
camel.kamelet.timer.a = foo

I wonder if this is a desired behavior. When running any integration which is missing the source file (ie kamel run xyz where xyz file does not exists), the CLI does not check if the file exists, creating an empty integration. I wonder if this is a bug and we should verify that the file exists and returning an error instead.

this issue has milestone 1.3.1 set but it is no tpart of 1.3.x branch
camel-k/pkg/cmd/run.go
Line 383
in
ed0456f
if isLocal(s) {
https://github.com/apache/camel-k/commits/release-1.3.x
Is it planned to backport it? (if it is a regression sounds a good idea) or the milestone needs to be updated?

kamel init - should not create source file with ASF license header
#1638

kubectl get camelcatalog
NAME RUNTIME VERSION RUNTIME PROVIDER
camel-catalog-1.6.0 1.6.0 quarkus
But when an integration is run:
kamel run examples/Sample.java -w
Then another catalog is created.
kubectl get camelcatalog
NAME RUNTIME VERSION RUNTIME PROVIDER
camel-catalog-1.6.0 1.6.0 quarkus
camel-catalog-1.6.0-quarkus 1.6.0 quarkus
The -quarkus catalog is created because a mechanism exists that creates a catalog when one is not available for the platform runtime. We have only 1 runtime now, but anyway a new catalog is created and the default one ignored.
At a first glance, the reason seems to be that the default catalog is missing the camel.apache.org/runtime.provider: quarkus annotation.
The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:

When using
kamel init Foo.java
Then the Foo.java file has ASF license header. As this is for end users then we should not have any license in the generated source code.

I think we can just remove the lookup by label and also get rid of camel.apache.org/runtime.provider altogether?

Users of Camel K can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on their preferred cloud (Kubernetes or OpenShift). How It Works Just write a helloworld.groovy integration file with the following content: from('timer:tick?period=3000')
.setBody().constant('Hello world from Camel K')
.to('log:info') You can then execute the following command: kamel run helloworld.groovy The integration code immediately runs in the cloud. Nothing else is needed.

Mailing Lists - Apache Camel Blog Documentation Community Download Mailing Lists Contents Use Camel User List Post plain text mails Use Camel User List You should post and subscribe to the Camel User List for all your questions on using Camel, or how to do X with Camel etc. If in doubt use this list. The Camel Developer List, is for the Camel team to discus development of the actual Camel project; do not use this list for questions on using Camel. Again to re-iterate, use the Camel User List, for your Camel questions. This is the correct mailing list, and has the most people there ready for helping you. Post plain text mails When posting to the mailing lists, use plain text mails. Do not use HTML mails. HTML mails is more likely to be targeted as spam mails and will be rejected; as well it’s not easily readable by others.

Support - Apache Camel Blog Documentation Community Download Support Contents Getting help Reporting bugs - Please read this first Reporting security issues Alternative discussion forums Using deprecated components How to get help How to get help faster Commercial Support Getting help If you are experiencing problems using Camel then please report your problem to our mailing list or Zulip chat. This allows the entire community to help with your problem. If indeed a bug has been identified in the Camel software, then document the problem in our Issue Tracker. Please refrain from immediately opening a ticket in the issue tracker unless you are certain it’s a problem in the Camel software. If you are in doubt, we appreciate asking the mailing list or Zulip chat first. Please read the section below (How to get help), and follow the bullets advised there first: Issue tracker FAQ Reporting bugs - Please read this first We prefer people to get in touch first using the mailing list, or Zulip chat. Or take time to read FAQs, or search in the mailing list archives to find answers. Unfortunately some people create a JIRA ticket as first thing. Please don’t do that! Only if you are sure it really is a bug etc. JIRA tickets create noise for the Camel team to react on issues that are not bugs but are already covered in FAQs, in the mailing lists etc., or in the existing documentation. Also on the mailing lists there are more people active to help you better. Also please avoid sending direct emails to members of the Camel team - we are busy already. And conversations about Camel should happen in the public, and not via private emails. Reporting security issues If you have found a security issue in Camel please contact the Apache Software Foundation security team. Don’t share the details in public (i.e. chat or users/developer mailing lists). We will receive details you send and resolve the issue as soon as possible. We might also contact you requesting further details as needed. Alternative discussion forums There’s a number of sites outside Apache that offer discussion forums on Camel. For example, Stack Overflow is a popular Q & A site with a dedicated Apache Camel forum. You are also likely to find helpful discussions on technical blogs, on Google, or even on Twitter. Using deprecated components Deprecated components are not supported and issues such as bugs may not be fixed. We encourage users to migrate away from using any deprecated component. A list of deprecated components is listed on the github page at: https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/components#components How to get help Before you report a problem, you may wish to read the FAQ. When you report an issue, please be sure to include as much information as possible. The more we know, the easier it is to reach an effective solution quickly. What version do you use What version of Camel do you use? Remember to include this information. what are the version numbers of involved software components? (this is very important to detail) what platform and JDK? any particular container being used? and if so, what version? stack traces generally really help! (Remember to post which version of Camel you use, this is important to know when posting stacktraces.) If in doubt, include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in other exceptions and the exception right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few lines at the top. It’s very easy for us to skim-read past unnecessary parts of a stack trace. log output can be useful too; sometimes enabling DEBUG logging can help your code & configuration files are often useful did it work before? what have you changed to break it? try upgrading to the latest release and see if it’s fixed there try the latest SNAPSHOT to see if it’s fixed in the pre-release search the user forum to see if has been discussed before see the “known issues” section in the release notes and check the issue tracker to see if the issue has already been reported do not send private emails to Camel Team members to ask them to help you faster, or in the private only. Help on Apache Camel is volunteer based and must happen in the open on the public Mailing Lists. If you want to get help faster or in private, then see further below. How to get help faster We can help you much quicker if you try the following provide us with a JUnit test case that demonstrates your issue. e.g. if you think you’ve found a bug, can you create a test case to demonstrate the bug? submit a patch fixing the bug! (We also buy you beer when we meet you if you submit bug fixes (smile) ) for memory leak or performance related issues, if you can run a profiler on your test case and attach the output as a file (or zipped file if it’s huge) to the JIRA we can normally fix things much faster. For example, you could run jmap/jhat, JProfiler or YourKit on your code and send us the output. To find memory leaks it’s quicker to resolve if you can tell us what classes are taking up all of the RAM; we can normally figure out what’s wrong from that. Commercial Support This is an open source project, so the amount of time we have available to help resolve your issue is often limited as all help is provided on a volunteer basis. If you want to get priority help, need to get up to speed quickly, require some training or mentoring, or need full 24 x 7 production support you could contact one of the following companies with Commercial Camel Offerings.

If you don’t fancy using Maven you can use your IDE directly or Download a distribution or JAR. Prequisites Required: Java 1.8 or 1.11 Maven Wrapper is used and bundled. Otherwise, download and install Maven Maven 3.6.x or newer is required to build Camel 3 onwards Get the latest source from Github Maven options To build camel maven has to be configured to use more memory Unix/Linux/Mac export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms2048m -Xmx3584m" Windows set MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms2048m -Xmx3584m" A normal build Beware this runs all the unit tests which takes a couple of hours. mvn clean install A quick build without running tests The following skips building the manual, the distro and does not execute the unit tests, which can complete in 15-20 minutes. mvn clean install -Pfastinstall A normal build without running tests but checkstyle verification enabled mvn clean install -Pfastinstall,sourcecheck Building with checkstyle To enable source style checking with checkstyle, build Camel with the -Psourcecheck parameter mvn clean install -Psourcecheck Building source jars If you want to build jar files with the source code, that for instance Eclipse can important so you can debug the Camel code as well. Then you can run this command from the camel root folder: mvn clean source:jar install -Pfastinstall Working with karaf features If you change anything in the features.xml from platform/karaf you can run a validation step to ensure the generated features.xml file is correct. You can do this running the following maven goal from the platform directory. mvn clean install -Pvalidate Back to top Overview＋ Blog Documentation Community Download Documentation＋ User Manual Components Camel-K Camel Kafka Connector Camel Quarkus Camel Spring Boot Camel Karaf FAQ Community＋ Support Contributing Mailing Lists User stories Articles Books Team About＋ Acknowledgments Apache Events License Security Sponsorship Thanks © 2004-2021 The Apache Software Foundation.

Then come back here and you might want to read the following documentation before continuing: Longer Getting Started Guide Find out about Enterprise Integration Patterns and how to implement them with Camel Review the Architecture guide to see how to build Routes using the Java DSL or XML DSL Working with CamelContexts and RouteBuilders To get started with Camel: Create a CamelContext. Optionally, configure components or endpoints. Add whatever routing rules you wish using the DSL and RouteBuilder or using XML DSL. Start the Camel context. When your application is closing you may wish to stop the context When you are ready, why not Walk through an Example? And then continue the walk Walk through another example. Working with Spring If you use Spring as a Dependency Injection container then please refer to the Camel Spring documentation. Other Resources We strongly suggest that you brew a cup of coffee or tea and take the 30 minutes to read one or more of the following resources: Camel in Action, Chapter 1 (direct link) free chapter 1 of the Camel in Action book. Highly recommended to read to learn what Camel is and the basic Camel concepts. This is a free chapter you can download directly as a pdf (about 20 pages) and introduces you to Camel. We have been told by experience Camel end users they wished this chapter was available to them when they started learning Camel. Open Source Integration with Apache Camel and How Fuse IDE Can Help by Jonathan Anstey. Updated article of the Apache Camel: Integration Nirvana. Great article to learn what Camel is and has a good use case example. Several of the vendors on the Commercial Camel Offerings page also offer various tutorials, webinars, examples, etc…​. that may be useful. Articles is a link collection with articles, blogs, podcasts, presentations and the likes about Camel done by people from the community.

Take any integration project and you have multiple applications talking over multiple transports on multiple platforms. As you can imagine, in large enterprise applications this can get complex very fast. Much of the complexity stems from two issues:1. dealing with the specifics of applications and transports, and2. coming up with good solutions to integration problems. Making your applications speak transports and APIs is relatively easy on its own. I'm sure everyone knows how to send JMS messages to their broker of choice; though it still requires in depth knowledge of the JMS specification, which many developers may not have. On top of that, what happens when you want to route that JMS message to another application? You then have to take care of mapping the JMS message to the application plus handle any new concepts related to the application. Add a dozen other applications into the mix and you've got quite a headache on your hands.Ignoring the mechanics of how to connect with multiple transports and APIs, we can focus on the high level design of how applications interact. Fortunately, most solutions to enterprise integration problems have been formalized already. Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolfe's book, Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions, boils down years of experience from enterprise architects into a set of sixty five Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs). This is great but we still have to hand code all parts of these patterns; these are not packaged solutions, only recommendations. Apache Camel was created with the intention of addressing these two issues. In this article I'll show you how it actually does this.What is Camel? Apache Camel is an open source Java framework that focuses on making integration easier and more accessible to developers. It does this by providing:• concrete implementations of all the widely used EIPs • connectivity to a great variety of transports and APIs• easy to use Domain Specific Language (DSL) to wire EIPs and transports together Figure 1 shows how these three items actually map to Camel concepts. To give you a good understanding of how Camel is organized, we will discuss Components, Endpoints, Processors, and the Domain Specific Language (DSL). There is of course a lot more going on here under the hood but we'll leave that for another discussion.
Figure 1: High level view of Camel's architecture.Components are the extension point in Camel to add connectivity to other systems. The core of Camel is very small to keep dependencies low, promote embeddability, etc. and as a result contains only 12 essential components. There are over 60 components outside the core. To expose these systems to the rest of Camel, Components provide an Endpoint interface. By using URIs, you can send or receive messages on Endpoints in a uniform way. For instance, to receive messages from a JMS queue aQueue and send them to a file system directory "c:/tmp", you could use URIs like "jms:aQueue" and "file:c:\tmp".Processors are used to manipulate and mediate messages in between Endpoints. All of the EIPs are defined as Processors or sets of Processors. As of writing, Camel supports 41 patterns from the EIP book, 6 other integration patterns, and many other useful Processors.To wire Processors and Endpoints together, Camel defines a Java DSL. The term DSL is used a bit loosely here as it usually implies the involvement of a compiler or interpreter that can process keywords specific to a particular domain. In Camel, DSL means a fluent Java API that contains methods named like terms from the EIP book. Its best explained with an examplefrom("jms:aQueue") .filter().xpath("/person[@name='Jon']") .to("file:c:\tmp");Here we define a routing rule in a single Java statement that will consume messages from the "jms:aQueue" Endpoint, send them through a Message Filter Processor, which will then send on messages passing the XPath condition to the "file:c:\tmp" endpoint. Messages failing the condition will be dropped.You can also configure your routes in a XML-based Spring configuration file. This configuration file is a lot more verbose and less auto complete friendly than the Java DSL; many prefer it though because of its direct access to Spring concepts and no requirement for compilation after changes. Here is what the earlier example would look like in Spring:<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"> <route> <from uri="jms:aQueue"/> <filter> <xpath>/person[@name='Jon']</xpath> <to uri="file:c:\tmp"/> </filter> </route></camelContext>
These are the concepts that Camel was built upon. Since then many other interesting features have been added. Details of these are left up to the reader to investigate. To get you started, some of these include:• Pluggable data formats and type converters for easy message transformation between Artix Data Services, CSV, EDI, Flatpack, HL7, JAXB, JSON, XmlBeans, XStream, Zip, Camel-bindy, etc. • Pluggable languages to create expressions or predicates for use in the DSL. Some of these languages include: EL, JXPath, Mvel, OGNL, BeanShell, JavaScript, Groovy, Python, PHP, Ruby, SQL, XPath, XQuery, etc. • Support for the integration of beans and POJOs in various places in Camel. • Excellent support for testing distributed and asynchronous systems using a messaging approach• and much more... Example A motorcycle parts business, Rider Auto Parts, supplies parts to motorcycle manufacturers. Over the years they've changed the way they receive orders several times. Initially, orders were placed by uploading CSV files to an FTP server. The message format was later changed to XML. Currently they provide a web site to submit orders as XML messages over HTTP. All of these messages are converted to an internal POJO format before processing.Rider Auto Parts states to any new customers to use the web interface to place orders. However, because of existing agreements with customers, they must keep all the old message formats and interfaces up and running.Solution using EIPs Rider Auto Parts faces a pretty common problem; over years of operation businesses acquire software baggage in the form of transports/data formats that are popular at the time. Using patterns from the EIP book we can envision the solution as something like Figure 2.

Contributing to Apache Camel
First of all, thank you for having an interest in contributing to Apache Camel.
If this is your first contribution to Camel, please review the guidelines for contributing to Camel and its related projects.
Then follow these simple guidlines for working on the code and committing your changes.
Fork and then clone the github camel repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/camel.git
Build the project using maven:
mvn clean install -Pfastinstall
Add a unit test with assertions for your changes.
Run checkstyle using the sourcecheck profile in maven:
mvn clean install -Psourcecheck
Check the documentation (.adoc file) for the code which you have modified and update it if required. For example if you have added or modified a component, the documentation file is in the src/main/docs folder.
Write a commit messsage which references the related JIRA or Github issue and includes some detail of your changes.
Contributing - Apache Camel Blog Documentation Community Download Contributing Contents Contributing to Apache Camel Getting in touch If you find a bug or problem Working on the documentation Working on the code Verify Karaf features Testing the changes Running checkstyle Submitting your contribution Creating a Pull Request at Github Manual patch files Becoming a committer Contributing to Apache Camel First of all, thank you for having an interest in contributing to Apache Camel. Here are some guidelines on how to best approach the Apache Camel community and how to best apply yourself. There are many ways you can help make Camel a better piece of software - please dive in and help! Try surfing the documentation - if something confuses you, bring it to our attention or suggest an improvement. Download the code & try it out and see what you think. Browse the source code. Got an itch to scratch, want to tune some operation, or add some feature? Want to do some hacking on Camel? Try surfing our issue tracker for open issues or features that need to be implemented. Take ownership of a particular issue, and try to fix it. If you are a new Camel rider and would like to help us, you can also find some easy to resolve issues or issues we need help with. Leave a comment on the issue to let us know you are working on it, and add yourself as a watcher to get informed about all modifications. Identify areas you can contribute first. You don’t have to be an expert in an area, the Apache Camel developers are available to offer help and guidance. Introduce yourself on the developer’s mailing list, tell us what area of work or problem you wish to address in Camel. Create a draft of your solution, this can be simple 1-2 sentences on the change you wish to make. Try to be as specific as you can: include a short description of your intent, what you tried and what didn’t work, or what you need help with. The best way of approaching the developers is by describing what you would like to work on and asking specific questions on how to get started. We’ll do our best to guide you and help you make your contribution. We also participate in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy programs; for information about those look at those program websites. If you wish to participate in either of those follow the guidelines and schedule set by those programs. If you are unsure please reach out via official communication channels of those programs, or ask on the developer’s mailing list for help. Getting in touch Apache Camel is an Apache Software Foundation project, all communication is done in the open on the project mailing lists. You can read more on the reasoning behind this to get a better understanding of this. All communication is subject to the ASF Code of Conduct. There are various ways of communicating with the Camel community. For questions and guidance around contributing subscribe to the developer’s mailing list by sending an e-mail to dev-subscribe@camel.apache.org. This page describes all the Camel mailing lists. We can also be reached on the Zulip chat at https://camel.zulipchat.com. If you find a bug or problem Please raise a new issue in our issue tracker. This way we’ll know when the issue has been fixed and we can ensure that the problem stays fixed in future releases. Please describe the bug/issue clearly, and add pictures/screenshots if necessary. If you can create a JUnit test case which demonstrates the problem, then your issue is more likely to be resolved quickly. For examples, take a look at some of the existing unit test cases. NOTE: you will need to register to create or comment on JIRA issues. The “Log In” link in the upper right will allow you to login with an existing account or sign up for an account. Working on the documentation Documentation is extremely important to help users make the most of Apache Camel and it’s probably the area that needs the most help! So if you are interested in helping the documentation effort; whether it’s just to fix a page here or there, correct a link or even write a tutorial or improve existing documentation please do dive in and help! Most of the documentation is managed in the same repositories as the related source code so the process is similar to working on the code. For more details please refer to Improving the documentation in the User Manual. Working on the code We recommend working on the code from the camel GitHub repository. Camel subprojects are maintained in separate repositories in GitHub. git clone https://github.com/apache/camel.git

[CAMEL-16576] Merge duplicate adoc and md files related to community topics - ASF JIRA
cd camel NOTE: If you are an Apache Camel committer, then you may also clone the ASF git repo. Build the project with Maven. Maven 3.6.x or newer is required to build Camel 3 or later. The following command will do a fast build. mvn clean install -Pfastinstall NOTE: You might need to build multiple times (if you get a build error) because sometimes maven fails to download all the required jars. Then import the projects into your workspace. You can find more details about building camel in the User Manual Building page. If you aren’t able to build a component after adding some new URI parameters due to Empty doc for option: [OPTION], parent options: <null> please make sure that you either added properly javadoc for get/set method or description in @UriPath annotation. Verify Karaf features Camel-Karaf now lives in its own repository, so to verify a Karaf feature, you’ll need to fork the camel-karaf repository. To check a new Karaf feature or an existing one, you should run a verification on the features.xml file. You’ll need to follow these steps: The first step is to run a full build of Camel. Then cd platform/karaf/features/
mvn clean install If you modified a component/dataformat or updated a dependency in the main camel repository, you’ll first need to build the main camel locally and then run a full build of camel-karaf. Testing the changes If you need to implement tests for your changes (highly recommended!), you will probably need to handle 3 separate things: simulate the infrastructure required for the test (ie.: JMS brokers, Kafka, etc), writing testable code, the test logic itself. Naturally, there is no rule of thumb for how the code changes and test logic should be written. The Testing page in the User Manual provides detailed information and examples for writing Camel unit tests. With regard to simulating the test infrastructure, there is a growing library of reusable components that can be helpful. These components are located in the test-infra module and provide support for simulating message brokers, cloud environments, databases and much more. Using these components is usually as simple as registering them as JUnit 5 extensions: @RegisterExtension
static NatsService service = NatsServiceFactory.createService(); Then you can access the service by using the methods and properties provided by the services. This varies according to each service. If you need to implement a new test-infra service, check the readme on the test-infra module for additional details. Running checkstyle Apache Camel source code uses a coding style/format that can be verified for compliance using the checkstyle plugin. To enable source style checking with checkstyle, build Camel with the -Psourcecheck parameter: mvn clean install -Psourcecheck Please remember to run this check on your code changes before submitting a patch or Github PR. You do not need to run this against the entire project, but only in the modules you modified. Let’s say you do some code changes in the camel-ftp component, following which you can run the check from within this directory: cd camel-ftp
mvn clean install -Psourcecheck Submitting your contribution We gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune, or fix Camel in some way. Make sure you have followed the steps and guidelines outlined in this document. For larger changes, make sure that you have discussed them on the developer’s mailing list or in the Jira issue tracker before hand. To get the best response from the team, make sure that the reasoning behind the contribution you wish to make is clear: outline the problem and explain your solution for it. Describe any changes you have made for which you are unaware or unsure of any consequences or side effects. Be mindful of the source checks, formatting and the structure of the git commit message we abide by. In particular, if there is a JIRA issue, reference it in the first line of your commit message, for example: CAMEL-9999: Some message goes here Ensure that the unit tests include proper assertions, and not only system.out or logging. Please also avoid unnecessary changes, like reordering methods and fields, which will make your PR harder to review. Following these guidelines will help you in getting your contribution accepted. Creating a Pull Request at Github The preferred way of submitting your contribution is to fork the camel Github repository and push your changes there. You can find many resources online explaining how to work on GitHub projects and how to submit work to these projects. After updating your private repository, create a Pull Request (PR). One of the committers then needs to accept your PR to bring the code into the ASF codebase. Expect that your Pull Request will receive a review and that you will need to respond and correspond to that via comments at GitHub. Stay engaged, follow and respond to comments or questions you might be asked. After the code has been included into the ASF codebase, you need to close the Pull Request because we can’t do that… Manual patch files For smaller patches, you may also submit a patch file instead of using a Pull Request. To do this: create a new JIRA issue attach the patch or tarball as an attachment tick the Patch Attached button on the issue Most IDEs can create nice patches now very easily. e.g., on Eclipse, right-click on a file/directory, and select Team -> Create Patch. Then save the patch as a file and attach it to the corresponding JIRA issue. If you prefer working on the command-line, try the following to create the patch: diff -u Main.java.orig Main.java >> patchfile.txt or git diff --no-prefix > patchfile.txt Becoming a committer Once you’ve become involved as above, we may well invite you to be a committer. See How do I become a committer for more details.

Description
In the User Manual, most of the files in the "Community" section (Mailing Lists, Support, Team, User Stories, as well as Books in the "Resources & Guides" section, exist as .adoc files in the camel project but also as .md files in camel-website/content/community. Some links in the website reference adoc files and others reference md files.
Both sets of files have changes so the content is not always consistent.Only one set of files should be maintained and the other ones should be removed.
After discussion with Zoran Regvart it has been decided to remove the .adoc files and keep the .md files.
The Community section in the user manual navigation panel and index page will be removed.
The /CONTRIBUTING.md in the GitHub Camel repository contains almost the same content as the contributing.adoc file in the User Manual. The main contributing content will be put in the camel-website/content/community section. The CONTRIBUTING.md file at the repository root will be contain only the guidelines for actually making a contribution and it will link to the Community contributing.md file.

README.md
Apache Camel
Apache Camel is a powerful, open-source integration framework based on prevalent
Enterprise Integration Patterns with powerful bean integration.
Introduction
Camel enables the creation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns to implement routing
and mediation rules in either a Java-based Domain Specific Language (or Fluent API),
via Spring or Blueprint based Xml Configuration files, or via the Scala DSL.
That means you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE whether
in your Java, Scala, or XML editor.
Apache Camel uses URIs to enable easier integration with all kinds of
transport or messaging model including HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA
or CXF together with working with pluggable Data Format options.
Apache Camel is a small library that has minimal dependencies for easy embedding
in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work with the same API regardless of the
transport type, making it possible to interact with all the components provided out-of-the-box,
with a good understanding of the API.
Apache Camel has powerful Bean Binding and integrated seamlessly with
popular frameworks such as Spring, CDI, and Blueprint.
Apache Camel has extensive testing support allowing you to easily
unit test your routes.
Components
Apache Camel comes alongside several artifacts with components, data formats, languages, and kinds.
The up to date list is available online at the Camel website:
Components: https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/
Data Formats: https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/dataformats/
Languages: https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/languages/
Miscellaneous: https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/#_miscellaneous_components
Examples
Apache Camel comes with many examples.

All the README.adoc files pointed to the support and contributing.html pages in the Camel user manual which have been removed in CAMEL-16576. I changed them to link to https://camel.apache.org/community/support/ and /community/contributing/.

The Community section of the Camel user manual contained .adoc pages which duplicated content in the Community section of the website. They've been removed and extra changes made there have been merged to the pages in the Community section.
There are also changes in the camel repository itself which need to be merged at the same time as these.
Remove .adoc files in camel for which there are .md files in community.

I'd remove Nabble, this is remnant of old mailing list archives. We should point the the new ASF archives for users mailing list: https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@camel.apache.org, developers: https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@camel.apache.org, commits: https://lists.apache.org/list.html?commits@camel.apache.org and issues: https://lists.apache.org/list.html?issues@camel.apache.org

…y content in camel-website.
The content in community/contributing.md is a combination of CONTRIBUTING.md at the root of the Camel GitHub
repository and the contributing.adoc page in the user manual. The CONTRIBUTING.md file has been shortened and
links to the community/contributing page. The Community section of the User mnanual is removed since all pages
except Release Guide are now in the Community section. The Release Guide and a page with hints for updating the
documentation in the User Manual are now in the "Resources and Guides" section. Links to Contributing in the
footers and a few other pages have been updated.

This is a red herring and is actually caused by items being left being left behind after uninstall. Therefore closing and referring to #2168 as the actual issue.

The liveness probe initialDelaySeconds is set to 5 seconds. In some "slow" environments, the operator pod may fail to start the liveness endpoint within that timeframe, so it ends in CrashLoopBackOff state.
The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:

In order to avoid potential errors, caused by an unsolicited upgrade of the Integration resources, their versions should be left unchecked, and only changed by an operation explicitly triggered by users, e.g., kamel rebuild.
Note that this also affects the IntegrationKits.

The CSV generated with make bundle contains some issues when compared with latest one published in https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/tree/master/community-operators/camel-k:
Some roles are repeated (sometimes with different content, sometimes they are equals)

Some annotations are no longer present (e.g. the ones that hide low-level resources in the console)
Operator is called "camel-k", not "camel-k-operator" (don't know which one is correct, but we always used the latter in community-operators)

this is based on a discussion I had with @astefanutti. The deployment / build on K3s is currently broken on master. After running a bisect, I identified the problem with the following commit: 0a21ad0
Unfortunately the log is not very helpful for this one and this is the only thing it prints (right after the successful maven build):

We are still on 2.11.x on Camel 3.8 as many of the components using jackson are using 2.11, and haven't upgraded to 2.12 yet. I am not sure if 2.12 is binary compatible with 2.11, so it a drop in replacement is possible.

Is quarkus 1.12 using jackson 2.12.x by default?
Yes, that's what they have in their master.

Eventhubs test is the only one known to me so far to have this problem. @jamesnetherton might know of others?

That's the only issue I've seen. I need to fix up the quarkus-master branch so that we can get a full build to double check.

Is this expected behavior? The integration file doesn't appear to let us control how scaling, I'm looking for it to create a single replicaset with a single pod or if i scale it to maintain a single replicaset with multiple pods but it seems to spam replicasets for a while before setting down.
If i look at the replicaset i see a bunch of scaling events but i'm unsure why

The operator-sdk CLI binary is used for the generation of the OLM bundle. Currently it is expected to be present in the PATH, which leads to results that are environment dependent. As the operator-sdk CLI often introduces breaking changes, this leads to regressions and wasted cycles.
Similarly to what we did for controller-gen and kustomize CLI binaries, for which we use expected versions retrieved locally, the generation of the OLM bundle should rely on a fixed version of the operator-sdk CLI that's also retrieved locally.

When deploying the splitter integration in the example/knative dir with latest Knative (verified on Serverless 1.13 and 1.14) and camel-k operator 1.3.2, splitter ksvc is repeatedly reconciled between two operators.
The same scenario works fine with camel-k operator 1.3.1, so it seems to be a regression in camel-k 1.3.2 vs 1.3.1.
See also #1936
possibly introduced by https://github.com/apache/camel-k/pull/2042/files ? (not verified)

The existing configuration for Maven builds should be augmented, so that users can provide CA certificates for their private Maven repositories.
The CA certificates could be provided in the form of binary secrets, that would be mounted into the builds, and passed to the Maven process.
Some details are documented in https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-repository-ssl.html.
This relates to #1332.

This is a red herring and is actually caused by items being left being left behind after uninstall. Therefore closing and referring to #2168 as the actual issue.

The behavior goes away when we remove the configuration block which contains
configuration:
- type: env
value: AWS_REGION=us-west-2
for the integration object. it creates one replicaset for each configuration entry.
is there a better way to pass environment variables?

I suspect there is another controller that applies conflicting changes to the Deployment. That would explain the deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 42 label. For each Deployment revision, a new ReplicaSet is created, and the previous one is scaled down.

@maschmid would that be possible for you to test if the issue is present in master branch?
I'm asking, because #2042 is required to fix other issues, but it's been a tactical fix specifically for 1.3.x, and another solution is currently present in master branch, so it that works on master, we may have a solution ready to backport.
Also, we need to make sure this is covered by the e2e tests.

Do we have a CI image of the operator I can use, or do I have to build it locally myself first?

To identify the other controller that can possibly change the Deployment, could you please provide its definition, by providing the output of kubectl get deployment processor-mj -o yaml?
Also, if this is possible for you, it could be interesting that you test on master branch, as we now use server-side apply to manage the Deployment (#2039).

Here is the output YAML. As mentioned by @mjallday, if we get rid of the env variables (first snippet below), then the system starts with just one replica set. 0 or 1 values in configuration lead to 1 replica set, 2 values in configuration lead to 2 replica sets, and it scales 1:1 up from there.
- type: env
value: AWS_REGION=us-west-2

Also in the context of #2083, we should normalize the way we reference generic Kubernetes resources.
I cannot find a standard for that. I see in the service-binding trait we're using a convention like:
PostgreSQL.v1alpha1.postgres.org/name[/ns1]
Which is not natural... A better way would be to use the Knative CLI convention using colon separators:
postgres.org:v1alpha1:PostgreSQL[:ns1]:name
Which also can simplify to:
PostgreSQL[:ns1]:name # if the kind is known
We can also allow both : and / as separators, to account for something like:
postgres.org/v1alpha1:PostgreSQL:ns1/name
Like the kn CLI, we can also use lowercase prefixes for special types, e.g.
channel:ch1
ksvc:myservice
broker:default

@maschmid sorry for the delayed answer, as I was AFK. Thanks a lot for the testing!
I've tried to test it on my setup (Camel K master branch, Knative 0.20 with Kourier, OCP 4.6) and could not reproduce. I can have the feed, splitter and printer integrations from the examples/knative directory working :( I'll try to understand what's different in my setup...
In the meantime, could you please share the content of the KnativeService and the Deployment resources? That may help me understanding what are the conflicting changes the Camel K operator and the Knative controller / webhook contend for.
In master branch we moved to using server-side apply (#2039), to try to cope with the issue. I assumed the problem is for environment variables set on the KnativeService, and that Knative also uses server-side apply.

I like the [[apigroup/]version:]kind:[namespace/]name form, which is also compatible with the lower-cased type shorthands.
I would avoid the apigroup:version and namespace:name forms, which do not appear standard in the Kubernetes eco-system.

Yes, I think that if we want to make more than 1 field optional, we cannot treat "/" and ":" as interchangeable.. Hoping that there are no other ambiguities..

Thinking a little bit more, we can also add options to define intermediate steps and error handling, like:
kamelet bind
--from=telegram-text-source
--step=log-action
--step=filter-action
--to=my-topic@kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic
--error-handler=my-error-handler

In the 1.3.x branch, #2042 is a fixed on top of #1937, that was too aggressive and prevented some required updates to the resources metadata.
Still, the fact I cannot reproduce on my setup puzzles me, and I'd like to have the bottom line of all this.

Thanks. I'm interested by the managed fields, that show all the controllers cooperating on the resource.
In my tests, I only have the camel-k-operator and (Knative) controller, but yours shows also the webhook as controller, that seems to have ownership for the containers field.

Right, I'd rather not make / and : interchangeable, both for avoiding possible ambiguities, and sticking to conventions.

Right I remember searching for a "standard" thinking this would be easy to find but came up empty handed ...
If we look at how the API server exposes the resource URLs, in order it goes apigroup then version then namespace then kind then name. Not sure how I feel about putting the namespace before kind...
I think I would prefer not having two different separators but it seems that way in most cases I see.
If we look at kubectl get, which I think I ended copying, its something like KIND[.VERSION][.GROUP]/NAME
At this stage I feel like I would +1 anything :)

One theory I have is this could be caused by a different sinkbinding configuration in Serverless... It uses SINK_BINDING_SELECTION_MODE=inclusion , which requires resources bound by SinkBinding to have bindings.knative.dev/include: "true" label.. (in this case, the ksvc)
without the label, the eventing webhook will not modify the ksvc during creation, but it will try to replace it at runtime... I suppose this could be causing the issue.

exclusion is default in upstream, OpenShift Serverless defaults to inclusion, because exclusion causes potentially any Deployment on the cluster to go via eventing webhook, which could cause instability (when a SinkBinding binding to Deployment exists, even system Deployments would go through eventing webhook)

I've been able to reproduce by editing the eventing webhook and setting SINK_BINDING_SELECTION_MODE=inclusion.

This can be fixed by upgrading to azure-bom 1.0.3 - see the linked PR. Some native compilation issues need to get fixed there. The upgrade to azure-bom 1.0.3 also fixes another, so far unreported problem mentioned by @llowinge.

Another case against / and : interchangeability, is that it increases complexity of equality comparison. We used to support it for dependency references, but that led to duplicated entries issues. Sooner or later, that increased complexity causes issues, as it's been forgotten to normalise before comparing or hashing. So I went ahead and removed it for dependencies (#1903).
Generally, : carries the semantic of "logical unit" separator, while / carries path-like or scoped-like semantic in tree-like structures.
For the namespace, it seems there is a consensus it's a path / scope, applied to the resource location "unit", hence, if we follow the above generality, should be followed by /.
For the type, it is less obvious to find a consensus in all the places that re-surface its serialised forms. As @johnpoth pointed out, you have kubectl get integrations.camel.apache.org/name. If we consider the API server REST contract as the source of truth, that command translates to the following request:
GET /apis/camel.apache.org/v1/namespaces/camel-k/integrations/name
Which is a serialised form of object reference! So maybe [group[/version]/][namespace/]kind/name is a solution :)

So, the impl in #2183 does a redeploy by default in case of matching binding name (which is computed after the bound resources, or it can be passed as --name arg).
The CLI has a nice sintax for multiple steps that is like:
--step kamelet1 --step kamelet2
They are kept sorted. The problem is when kamelet1 has a required parameter... how do we specify it?

I'm realizing that adding the bindings.knative.dev/include: "true" label, to the source object referenced in the SinkBinding, may have been the solution all along.
The source objects are owned by Camel K, and we always want the eventing webhook to select them, irrespective of the Knative sink binding configuration (Inclusion or Exclusion).
I've tried that approach and it seems to be working well.

If you need help on how to create a local development environment based on Minishift or Minikube, you can follow the local cluster setup guide.
Installation
Make sure you apply specific configuration settings for your cluster before installing Camel K. Customized instructions are needed for
the following cluster types:
Minikube
Minishift
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
OpenShift
IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS)
Other cluster types (such as OpenShift clusters) should not need prior configuration.
To start using Camel K you need the "kamel" binary, that can be used to both configure the cluster and run integrations.
Look into the release page for latest version of the kamel tool.
If you want to contribute, you can also build it from source! Refer to the contributing guide
for information on how to do it.
Once you have the "kamel" binary, log into your cluster using the standard "oc" (OpenShift) or "kubectl" (Kubernetes) client tool and execute the following command to install Camel K:
kamel install
This will configure the cluster with the Camel K custom resource definitions and install the operator on the current namespace.
Important
Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) are cluster-wide objects and you need admin rights to install them. Fortunately this
operation can be done once per cluster. So, if the kamel install operation fails, you’ll be asked to repeat it when logged as admin.

Right, that's possible the namespaces segment is there for that reason, so that it solves ambiguity between namespace-scoped and cluster-scoped resources. So that would lead to [group[/version]/][namespaces/ns/]kind/name.
A couple of examples to see how it compares to [[apigroup/]version:]kind:[namespace/]name:

==============
Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration platform, born on Kubernetes, with serverless superpowers.
## Installation
To start using Camel K, install the operator and then create the following `IntegrationPlatform`:
```
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: IntegrationPlatform
metadata:
name: camel-k
labels:
app: "camel-k"
```
An `IntegrationPlatform` resource is automatically created by default on OpenShift, so you can skip this step.
Also, You can edit the `IntegrationPlatform`, to configure Camel K.
The configuration from the `IntegrationPlatform` will apply to the Camel integrations created in the same namespace/project.
## Running an Integration
After the initial setup, you can run a Camel integration on the cluster by creating an example `Integration`, e.g.:
```
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration

Add this suggestion to a batch that can be applied as a single commit.
For Minishift, this means executing oc login -u system:admin then kamel install --cluster-setup only for first-time installation.
Running an Integration
After the initial setup, you can run a Camel integration on the cluster by executing:
kamel run examples/languages/Sample.java
During your first run you may see your console stuck with the following message:
integration "sample" created
integration "sample" in phase Waiting For Platform
Note
It will take some time for your integration to get started for the first time. This is because the camel-k operator has to pull and cache the camel-k builder images into the cluster’s registry.
You can follow this process by watching the pods in the namespace where the operator is running:
kubectl get pods -w
You should see something like:
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
camel-k-cache 0/1 Completed 0 3m29s
camel-k-groovy-builder 1/1 Running 0 32s
camel-k-jvm 0/1 Completed 0 61s

This fixes duplication of dependencies caused by different GAV string representations. This PR drops the mvn:group/artifact representation in favour of the mvn:group:artifact one.

Works for me, and the fix looks good to me, too. I agree the "bindings.knative.dev/include=true" should be safe to add with either setting.

I am facing the same issue. it there a workaround for it for now?
Currently I just roll back to using 1.3.1. But where is this "bindings.knative.dev/include=true" I can set?

@weimeilin79 If you install via an Operator (Serverless operator or Knative Operator), a possible workaround could be to switch KnativeEventing sinkBindingSelectionMode to exclusion
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
name: knative-eventing
namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
sinkBindingSelectionMode: exclusion

@fshaikh-vgs thanks for the details.
If I understand your use case correctly, this is the expected behaviour of the Kubernetes Deployment controller. When the Integration is updated with an extra environment variable, the Camel K operator adds it to the Deployment. Then Kubernetes triggers a rollout deployment, that creates a new ReplicaSet. This is described in details in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#updating-a-deployment.
In order to avoid that behaviour, it is possible to pause the Deployment, to apply a sequence of updates, without creating a new ReplicaSet for each one, then resume the Deployment. This is documented in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#pausing-and-resuming-a-deployment. That being said, I'm not sure it'll work for the Deployment created and managed by the Camel K operator, and owned by the Integration.

Properties associated to an integration can be configured either using a ConfigMap/Secret or by setting using the "--property" flag, i.e.
kamel run --property my.message=test examples/props.js
kamel run --configmap=<your name here> examples/props.js
Note: to create the config map first create a file called application.properties which contains lines with key=value pairs
e.g. my.message="The text to display"
Create the config map in the usual manner e.g.
kubectl create configmap <your name here> --from-file=application.properties
Configure Integration Logging
camel-k runtime uses log4j2 as logging framework and can be configured through integration properties.
If you need to change the logging level of various loggers, you can do so by using the logging.level prefix:
logging.level.org.apache.camel = DEBUG
Configure Integration Components
camel-k component can be configured programmatically inside an integration or using properties with the following syntax.
As example if you want to change the queue size of the seda component, you can use the following property:
camel.component.seda.queueSize = 10
Configure Integration Volumes
It’s possible to mount persistent volumes into integration containers by using the -v or --volume flag. The format of volume flag value is similar to that of the docker CLI. But instead of specifying a host path to mount from, you reference the name of a PersistentVolumeClaim that you have already configured within the cluster. E.g
kamel run examples/Sample.java -v myPvcName:/some/path
Configure Environment Variables
It’s possible to configure environment variables for integration containers by using the -e or --env flag:
kamel run examples/Sample.java -e MY_ENV_VAR=some-value
Running Integrations in "Dev" Mode for Fast Feedback
If you want to iterate quickly on an integration to have fast feedback on the code you’re writing, you can use by running it in "dev" mode:
kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev
The --dev flag deploys immediately the integration and shows the integration logs in the console. You can then change the code and see
the changes automatically applied (instantly) to the remote integration pod.
The console follows automatically all redeploys of the integration.
Here’s an example of the output:
[nferraro@localhost camel-k]$ kamel run examples/Sample.java --dev

Here a guideline that will help you configure your local operator running. Running operator locally As soon as you build your operator locally you will ask yourself how to test it. The idea is that you execute it locally and instruct it to watch a namespace on a Kubernetes cluster (it may be remote or any local environment). Let’s use a namespace called operator-test. We start by setting the environment variable WATCH_NAMESPACE with the namespace you’d like your operator to watch. export WATCH_NAMESPACE=operator-test The next step is to install an IntegrationPlatform on the cluster namespace. You probably need to tweak the registry parameters in order to be able to authenticate against an image repository (see below paragraph for local repository instructions). ./kamel install --skip-operator-setup -n operator-test --registry my-registry:5000 Finally, assuming you’ve builded your application correctly we can run the operator: ./kamel operator Test the local operator by creating a test Integration. ./kamel run xyz.abc -n operator-test make sure no other Camel K Operators are watching that namespace, neither you have a global Camel K Operator installed on your cluster. Local operator and local cluster If you want to run a local operator togheter with Minikube you will need an additional step in order to let the local operator being able to push images in the local registry. We need to expose the local registry as described in this procedure: Enable the addon registry (this should be already in place): minikube addons enable registry Get the Pod name that is in charge to run the registry and proxy the registry 5000 port to be used locally. kubectl get pods -n kube-system

In case changing the Serverless / Knative configuration is not an option, another work-around is to add the label manually, e.g.:
$ kamel run --label bindings.knative.dev/include=true -t owner.target-labels=bindings.knative.dev/include

@astefanutti thanks for the quick response! but it is not updated with an extra environment variable, all the variables are provided at once in one file.. why can't camel K apply it once?

Ah I misunderstood it. Thanks for the clarification, now I think I got this right.
So I think it's fixed with #2039, that introduces server-side apply to manage the Integration Deployment.
The underlying issue lies in the way we process environment variables as a map[string]string, and Go explicitly randomises keys order, so that ultimately leads to Deployment revisions, hence ReplicaSets, for all possible combinations. Server-side apply is clever enough to handle the ordering differences, as it uses the environment variable name as merge key.
Even if that is fixed with #2039, as a safe measure, I think it's still important that we avoid processing these environment variables as map[string]string and the resulting randomisation.

Since the integration is using the "imap:" prefix, Camel K is able to automatically add the "camel-mail" component to the list of required dependencies.
This will be transparent to the user, that will just see the integration running.
Automatic resolution is also a nice feature in --dev mode, because you are allowed to add all components you need without exiting the dev loop.
You can also use the -d flag to pass additional explicit dependencies to the Camel client tool:
kamel run -d mvn:com.google.guava:guava:26.0-jre -d camel-mina2 Integration.java
Not Just Java
Camel K supports multiple languages for writing integrations:

Kotlin Script .kts files are supported (experimental).
More information about supported languages is provided in the languages guide.
Integrations written in different languages are provided in the examples directory.
An example of integration written in JavaScript is the /examples/dns.js integration.
Here’s the content:
// Lookup every second the 'www.google.com' domain name and log the output
from('timer:dns?period=1000')
.routeId('dns')
.setHeader('dns.domain')
.constant('www.google.com')
.to('dns:ip')
.to('log:dns');
To run it, you need just to execute:
kamel run examples/dns.js
Traits
The details of how the integration is mapped into Kubernetes resources can be customized using traits.
More information is provided in the traits section.
Monitoring the Status
Camel K integrations follow a lifecycle composed of several steps before getting into the Running state.
You can check the status of all integrations by executing the following command:
kamel get
Contributing
We love contributions and we want to make Camel K great!
Contributing is easy, just take a look at our developer’s guide.

Existing comparison for deep derivative equality of the Spec field is not enough and breaks logic based on metadata, mainly annotations and labels, like garbage collection.

Ok, the annotations were missing only in the 1.3.x branch. That's not a problem since I think we're not going to do another release from there.
Tried on master with operator-sdk 1.3.0 and duplicates are no longer present.
Note that operator-sdk 1.3.0 works on master, but even 1.3.2 fails, but this is another issue..

After a lot of help from @astefanutti debugging the issues #2160 and #2161 we identified the cause as being related to the code leaving behind items after uninstall.
Those issues were caused because an outdated CRD was left behind on the cluster even though I have been using both kamel uninstall --all --global and kubectl delete namespace $(NAMESPACE) to cleanup the environment.
In order to properly cleanup the cluster I also had to run:
kubectl delete crd builds.camel.apache.org
kubectl delete crd builds.camel.apache.org
kubectl delete crd kamelets.camel.apache.org
kubectl delete crd kameletbindings.camel.apache.org
kubectl delete clusterrole camel-k:edit
I think it would be good to either:
Document the need to remove those items after uninstall or
Remove them after uninstall
Overwrite them during install if they are present
I believe overwriting them may be a better solution since these items may exist on cluster than have ran older versions of Camel K.
The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:

@astefanutti I am not sure if we should have closed this one. I was looking at my cluster and the uninstall is still leaving things behind:
kubectl delete crd integrationkits.camel.apache.org
kubectl delete crd integrationplatforms.camel.apache.org
kubectl delete crd integrations.camel.apache.org
kubectl delete crd camelcatalogs.camel.apache.org

@orpiske it may be that you have to add the --olm=false option, e.g. kamel uninstall --all --global --olm=false, otherwise it defaults to using OLM, which does not delete CRDs when uninstalling an operator.

Just wanted to provide a feedback that it did remove the items I mentioned after I used what you suggested. Thanks @astefanutti!

Server-side apply has been introduced to improve co-operation of controllers, in defining the desire state for shared resources.
We previously implemented a custom strategy, relying on a combination of merge patch and pruning of nil values, but that fails to leverage the semantic provided by the strategic merge patch field markers, as strategic merge patch is not supported by CRDs, like Knative Service.
With server-side apply, markers can be applied to data structures (Lists, Maps), to make valid and finer-grained merge strategies.
This particularly helps cooperation of the Camel K operator with its Knative counterpart, into updating the Knative service pod template fields, such as the Env []EnvVar field, that declares the +patchStrategy=merge marker, which translates into the server-side apply listType and +listMapKey markers.

it is currently An external library that should be included. E.g. for Maven dependencies "dependency=mvn:org.my:app:1.0"
it can also be used for specifying Camel components, using artifact ids. For instance, in case a toD is used in the route and cannot be determined automatically.

Example: https://github.com/jeremyrdavis/quarkus-cafe-demo/commits/camel-k-addition
- commit works: d95b5ea360ca1dabe333b2ce568fc87b18e8594d
- commit does not work: 4ee524f4ccf2c9dce3005b80e7fa44b4d1546528
Process on OpenShift 4.4:

This should not be an issue any-more in camel-k 1.0.0
The issues was caused by a bug in the jOOR library which is used to compile the Java integration at runtime which is included in jOOR's 0.9.13 [1]. The camel-k-runtime version used by camel-k RC2 is
1.1.0 [2] which dos not includes the fix [3]

@bouskaJ awesome!
It's possible that CI is currently broken as the Camel / Camel Quarkus upgrade is being rolling out and needs #2197 to complete.
Yes, we may merge #2197 to have less errors, as the only issue seems in runtime: apache/camel-k-runtime#651. Wdyt?

Good idea, +1 for me, then we can rebase the pending PRs.

May this fix the yaks tests in other PRs (this one seems hitting another error)?
I see that YAKS failing to get the pod is due to knative creating two revisions of the same integration, with one of them disappearing after the timeout.

This PR makes sure the Eventing webhook will select the source resources, in order to inject the sink information.
This is necessary for Knative environments, that are configured with SINK_BINDING_SELECTION_MODE=inclusion. See:
https://knative.dev/v0.20-docs/eventing/sources/sinkbinding/
https://github.com/knative/operator/blob/c60e62bb86ff318c44d1520927d2182659cfdeb5/docs/configuration.md#specsinkbindingselectionmode
Fixes #2184.

@bouskaJ thanks again for the awesome work.
It seems the test sometimes fails with the following error:
olm_upgrade_test.go:94:
Timed out after 300.006s.
Expected
<v1alpha1.ClusterServiceVersionPhase>: Succeeded
to equal
<v1alpha1.ClusterServiceVersionPhase>: Replacing
--- FAIL: TestOLMAutomaticUpgrade/OLM_upgrade (300.01s)
I wonder if that's just a race issue, or that the phase is not as expected.
Also, I understand that the operator upgrade is triggered by updating the index image in the CatalogSource. However, the CSV generated for the new version does not have a replaces field. So I wonder, are we sure that this sequence mimics exactly a typical upgrade performed by OLM?

Fix #2083
This works, but I'm looking for better ways..
Current syntax is like:
# Unqualified references default to "kamelet:"
kamel bind telegram-source broker:default -p source.authorizationToken=xxx
# Bound elements can also be full refs and Camel URIs

I'd like to be sure that what the test covers is an actual upgrade, rather than just a replace.

Hi, @astefanutti yes, there is no replaces but the replace scenario is forced by the skipRange (see https://github.com/apache/camel-k/blob/master/.github/workflows/upgrade.yml#L138).
I was considering:
replaces because it was close to the real upstream releases
skipRange - used in the internal stream (at the day I was writing the test)
I decided on the skipRange because it is able to force an upgrade on the older releases as well so the test is not dependent on the very last release -> devel version. I think we can migrate to replaces since both streams use replaces at the moment in the real manifests.

I am not sure why, it's failing. Maybe, the OLM needs more time to start the upgrade and we should use TestTimeoutLong https://github.com/apache/camel-k/blob/master/e2e/upgrade/olm_upgrade_test.go#L94

force-pushed the
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:test log:info
So there's a single "-p" option with properties that need to be prefixed with source. or sink..
This avoid having to define e.g. --source-property and --sink-property, which is the other option I've considered.
But both approaches fail when it comes for steps. It's easy to add a --step to add other endpoints, but how to specify their related properties? Like: -p step-0.prefix=World -p step-1.prefix=Hello?

Wonder if they can be considered somehow as URI
kamel bind telegram-source?options broker:default?options --step step1?options
we can use something like
?id=test
to define the properties prefix ?

chore: add some more time to YAKS tests

This PR adds support for using custom Maven CA certificate(s).
Users are expected to provide a Secret, containing the CA certificate(s), to be used to connect to remote Maven repositories. It can contain X.509 certificates, and PKCS#7 formatted certificate chains. A JKS formatted keystore is automatically created to store the CA certificate(s), and configured to be used as a trusted certificate(s) by the Maven commands. Note that the root CA certificates are also imported into the created keystore.
The new spec.build.maven.caSecret field from the IntegrationPlaform CRD, is used to store the reference to the secret key selector that contains the CA certificate(s), e.g.:
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: IntegrationPlatform
spec:
build:
maven:
caSecret:
key: tls.crt
name: tls-secret
This PR also adds the --maven-ca-secret option to the kamel install command, that can be used to configure the created IntegrationPlatform, e.g.:
$ kamel install --maven-ca-secret <secret_name>/<secret_key>
Fixes #2149.
TODO:
Add support to CamelCatalog build
Add support to OpenAPI build
Import root CA certificates into local trust store
Proper truststore password handling
Import CA Secret by piping into keytool stdin (avoid writing into a tmp file)
Add a CLI option to the kamel install command

Description
RestDefinition relies on Class.getCanonicalName instead of Class.getName for in/out types.
This work as long as the type is not an inner class getCanonicalName does not return a name that can be used to load a class.
As example
package my.example;
public class MyRoutes extends org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder {
@Override
public void configure() throws Exception {
rest()
.post("/order")
.type(MyOrder.class)
.consumes("application/json")
.produces("application/json")
.bindingMode(RestBindingMode.json)
.route()
}
public static class MyOrder {
public String id;
}
}
Then camel would set my.example.MyRoutes.MyOrder as in type but that's wrong and the subsequent attemp to load the class by name, will fail as it should be my.example.MyRoutes$MyOrder (which is what Class.getName would return).
