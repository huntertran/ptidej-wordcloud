Eclipse Titan is a TTCN-3 compilation and execution environment with an Eclipse-based IDE
.
TTCN-3 is a
modular language specifically designed for testing (the acronym itself stands for Test and Test Conformance Notation), standardized by ETSI (see
www.ttcn-3.org
) and endorsed by ITU.
The user of the tool can develop test cases, test execution logic and build the executable test suite for several platforms.
Titan consists of a core part, executing in a Unix/Linux-like environment and a set of Eclipse plug-ins.
Titan
Titan compiles and executes test cases. It has four major roles:
*
The TTCN-3
design environment provides
an efficient way to create the TTCN-3 test suites (called the abstract test suite, ATS). The IDE is Eclipse‑based and is called Titan Designer.
It has editors
that provide the usual IDE features
for TTCN-3, ASN.1 and the Titan runtime configuration file. Like creating and configuring Titan projects, syntax highlighting, name convention checking, jump to definition, on-the-fly syntax and semantic analysis, simple content assist, outline of the module
s, mark occurrences etc. ASN.
1 and XSD sources are typically not created by testers, but are coming from specifications. Nevertheless Titan contains a full-featured ASN.1 editor. XSD sources can be viewed, edited and validated by using any
Eclipse
XML editors capable of validating XSD.
The Designer also allows building the project. It has a built-in Makefile generator for GNU and GCC makes and allows setting Titan compiler and GCC compiler and linker flags. The source code is first compiled by the Titan compiler to C++ code, then external C++ compiler and linker are called to build the executable file (which is called the host controller -
HC
). The whole building process is invoked and controlled by the Designer and is running in a command line shell in the background .
*
The Titan compiler builds an
executable test suite
(
ETS
) from the ATS, the test port code (see below) and the Titan runtime library. The ETS is not always directly executable as the TTCN-3 language and Titan allows very flexible runtime parameterization of the test cases (e.g. IP addresses, port numbers etc. in the lab); the values of runtime parameters need not be defined in development time - though default values can be specified-, but they can be provided just before the test execution session. In this way flexible execution scenarios can be created without re-building the ETS;
*
Titan
runtime control
has several tasks:
- the Titan
Main Controller (MC)
read and distributes to all test components the runtime configuration parameters;
- it controls the execution of test cases in a distributed multiplatform environment;
- it keeps up and running the test system: in case of a runtime error, Titan runtime control cleans up the test system, assigns an "error" verdict to the given test case and starts execution of the next test case);
- it produces logs in different formats; Titan has a logging API and
logging
is done via plugins. Currently we have plugins for Titan’s own textual log format and for Jenkins
(junit format)
. Thus, developing a new logging plugin, e.g. for LTTng doesn’t require much
knowledge
of Titan's
code
. S
everal logging mechanisms may be activated at the same time. L
ogging can be configured by verbosity and by event types. Logs can be written into files or be send to another process or via a network connection to a 3
rd
party tool
.
Titan contains two MC implementations: a command line MC and an MC implemented in the Titan Executor Eclipse plugin.
*
Command line
log post-processing utilities
and the Eclipse-based Titan
LogViewer
help analyzing the test results. These tools currently
process Titan's own log format only.
In a model-based testing (MBT) scenario, the test cases generated from the model are necessarily abstract, as the model itself does not contain low level information. Therefore the abstract test cases has to be completed by a test harness, to become executable test cases. TTCN-3 and Titan
in several projects
have proved
to be
an ideal platform for
developing
the test harness, for integrating the generated abstract test cases with the test harness and the test environment, and for test execution
.
Though Titan is told to be "a TTCN-3 test tool", in fact it is able to use TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD and IDL specifications describing the message and signal
structures at the tested interfaces. ASN.1 is imported directly, while XSD and IDL are first converted to TTCN-3 and then the generated TTCN-3 modules are used in the projects. In case of XSD the TTCN-3 module is decorated with XML encoding instructions. Titan also supports codec control decorators in TTCN-3 files for binary and textual protocol encodings. Defining the test configurations and the dynamic behaviour of the tests are written in TTCN-3. Functions written in C/C++ can be also be called in the TTCN-3 code.
Titan consists of the following components, these are all subject of this project:

Test Ports
The TTCN-3 code is generic: the interfaces between the tester and the tested entity (SUT, AUT etc.) are specified at the level of the exchanged abstract data messages and signals.
S
etting up and maintaining the transport connections, and sending/receving "real" messages and signals are the tasks of interface adaptors.
Adaptors are called test ports (TPs) and are plugins written in C++
. Titan has a C++ API for adaptors that complete the ATS with the connectivity layer(s) between the test system and the SUT.
Titan test port (adaptors) included into this project proposal provide the following capabilities:
Name
Function
Implementation language
TCP
Provides communicatin over TCP-type connections in IP networks. It uses the Absrtact Socket library, therefore its supports the features of the Abstract Socket described below. Connections can be static for the time of the test case (opened/starts listening at the TTCN-3 map operation and closed at unmap) or can be opened/closed dynamically from the TTCN-3 code. Multiple TCP connections are supported by one port instance.
C++
UDP
Provides UDP-type connections
in IP networks
. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's UDP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port can handle multiple UDP connections.
C++
TELNET
Allows using remote telnet login from TTCN-3 via the TCP layer of the operating system. The test port supports client and server mode operation. In server mode operation the Telnet Test Port can handle one connection simultaneously. Supports the capabilities of Network Virtual Terminal. Telnet connection parameters (login creadentials, terminal type, prompt format with or without wildcards etc.) can be configured in Titan's runtime configuration file.
C++
SQL
The SQL test port executes SQL statement against the SQL database. The SQL test port is able to handle different SQL engines and databases, and provides an unified interface towards them. Currently MySQL, SQLite C API-s are supported (and required from the database).
C++
PIPE
The PIPE test port is developed to execute shell commands from the TTCN-3 test suite. It provides abstract service primitives to communicate with the user. The stdin, stdout and stderr of the process are returned to the user.
C++
SCTP
ProvidesSCTP-type connections
in IP networks
. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's SCTP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port instance can handle multiple SCTP connections in either server or client mode.
C++
HTTP
Allows sending and receiving HTTP messages between the test suite and SUT via a TCP/IP connection. It uses the Abstract Socket library. Both IP version 4 and 6 are supported and it can handle multiple connections.
C++
PCAP
The PCAP test port has basically two operating modes.
In reading mode
, it is able to process recorded network traffic, saved in a file in libpcap format (used e.g. also by the open source Wireshark tool), and decode various application layer protocol messages. These messages are then delivered to TTCN-3.
In capturing mode
the test port can be used to capture Ethernet packets to a file, controlled from the TTCN-3 environment.
Filtering of messages can be set both at capturing and reading modes.
C++
LANL2
Allows communicating with the SUT at the low level Ethernet connectivity. The test port translates the LANL2 service primitives (ASPs) and messages (PDUs) sent from the TTCN-3 code to Ethernet II frames when sending and translates the received packets to LANL2 ASPs att receipt. The test port uses the Packet Socket on Linux and the DLPI interface on Solaris (using DLIOCRAW mode).
C++
SIP
Handles SIP connections; The test port can handle SIP request and SIP response messages and it can use both UDP and TCP connection to send and receive messages. The built in encoder can encode SIP request and SIP response messages and it is possible to send raw and fragmented [28] messages trough the test port. The name of the header can be encoded in short or long format.
In
basic mode
the test port can handle only one TCP connection or one UDP socket. It is not possible to send and receive messages using both protocols at the same time, but the test port can switch between protocols and remote hosts.
In advanced mode
the test port can handle several TCP connections and listen on both UDP and TCP ports at the same time. Each connection is distinguished by the protocol id, remote host name and the remote port number.
The test port used to be compatible with ETSI's SIP type definitions, therefore
ETSI SIP library
could be used with it. ETSI has slightly changed one of its type definition lately, therefore the test port needs to be updated to be compatible with ETSI's
LibSip v2.0
.
C++
Abstract Socket
It is not a test port, but a library that can be used to build test ports that are using the TCP internet protocol connection; it uses the services provided by the UNIX socket interface and implements basic sending, receiving and socket handling routines. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6, client and server modes and also supports SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1secure connections (the used secure protocol is selected during the SSL handshake automatically).
C++
Protocol Modules
Protocol modules implements static data structure and message encoding/decoding, defined in the specification of the given protocol. Protocols are most often
specified by standard bodies for the interfaces, where equipments of different vendors may or need communicate with each other, but of course, interface specifications may also be vendor-specific.
Protocol modules can support both cases and shall be in TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD, or IDL (Corba). JSON support is being developed currently. The protocol modules made available in this project proposal are all defined by IETF and all these specifications are publically available.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 is a high-level, abstract language. The code itself is platform independent (e.g. no integer value range or float precision requirements in the language, these are defined by tool implementations; memory allocation is completely solved by tools).
TTCN-3 is test environment independent. In TTCN-3 only the abstract messages/signals, exchanged between the test system and the tested entity (SUT, AUT, etc.) are defined, the transport layers and connections are provided and handled by the tools. Message/signal encoding (serialization) and decoding (deserialization) is completely done by the tool in the background. The user, if wants, can access the encoded data in TTCN-3, and the encoded data is also logged for debugging purposes. TTCN-3 also allows leaving data open in the source code and providing the actual values at execution time (i.e. typically IP- and other addresses, IDs and passwords, SUT/AUT parameters for automatic test case selection etc.). All this allows executing the test cases, unchanged, on different platforms and in different test environments.
The TTCN-3 language has four major parts:
A rich data/type system
I
t allows describing the messages/signals of practically all possible protocols and APIs.
Except defining data structures in TTCN-3, the language specify the ways of importing other data type/schema languages - as ASN.1, IDL, XSD and currently JSON mapping is being defined, i.e. using them in TTCN-3 test suites without the need of manual conversion. TTCN-3 can also be used as a schema language for XML and JSON (ongoing).
As an extension, Titan also allows adding encoding instructions to TTCN-3 types to automatically encode them in binary (bit-oriented) or (simple) textual forms, XML or JSON (for ASN.1 data BER/CED/DER encodings are supported).
Test configuration
TTCN-3 allows defining multi-process distributed test cases and test execution logic easily (processes are called “test components”). It is the tools' responsibility to deploy and control the test components on the available pool of machines, possibly running different OS-es. The user need not bother about the details (see also the example below). Types of the test components and their interfaces (ports) to other test components and the tested entity are defined in TTCN-3. The number of test component instances and their port connections are controlled from the test case code dynamically, using built-in language statements.
Test dynamic behaviour
TTCN-3 is a procedural programming language specialized for testing. This means that is has the usual programming language features and in addition, constructs needed for testing are built-in the
language. S
ending/receiving messages, checking the content of the incoming messages, alternative test behaviours depending on the response of the tested entity(including no answer), handling timers and timeouts, logging of events, verdict assignment and collection from the different components of the test system and alike.
Test execution control
Test case execution logic and dynamic test selection can be controlled from the TTCN-3 code itself.
TTCN-3 is a dynamically developing language. In 2003, at publication of its first implemented version, it consisted of two documents (core language and operational semantics), 316 pages in total. In 2005, in TTCN-3 edition 3, tool implementation parts and interworking with ASN.1 has been added and the language specification was published in 7 documents, on 846 pages in total. The first version of TTCN-3 edition 4, in 2009, added interworking with IDL and XSD that increased the number of published pages to 948 in 8 documents (two earlier parts had been made historical in edition 4) . From 2010 language extensions for real time and performance testing, configuration and deployment, testing of interfaces with continuous signals and some advanced language features are published in separate language extension documents. Up to now 6 language extension packages have been published and today, in June 2014, the whole language specification consists of 1422 pages in 14 documents. ETSI is securing the maintenance and development of the language by establishing a project team from ETSI members. The project is financed from ETSI budget.
Example
The following TTCN-3 code shows a Hello Word! example, but it doesn't simply prints out the string.
The PTC first matches the received message against the pattern specified by the TTCN-3 template t_expected. "hello world!" in all small, all capital or small with capital first letters are allowed. Whitespaces are allowed (also at the beginning and end of the string), but there shall be at least one space between "hello and "world". Exclamation mark is optional. If this match successful, the
pass
verdict, if unsuccessful, the
fail
verdict is assigned to the test case and the reason is logged (expected/not the expected message has been received plus the message itself).

There are many reasons why one would want to test their products or projects. We can enumerate a few from
the wikipedia definition
:
it meets the requirements that guided its design and development,
it responds correctly to all kinds of inputs,
it is sufficiently usable
In other words,
we test since we want to make sure things work properly
.
Why did I want to test my project in particular? Well, since
the project I am testing
deals with
my HVAC at home
and that is a pretty expensive piece of hardware, the drawbacks of making a mistake can cost me big bucks.
Or injure someone in my family
. Or both. So there was no way I could put my project "in production" without testing it first.
Why Automating?

Of course one can test manually all the features of a project. It just takes time to do it. Big time.
Imagine running few tests today to evaluate how good your software behaves. That's fine. Tomorrow you change a little bit and you have to test again to make sure you did not break something. Then the day after tomorrow, then next week and so on. You could end up spending a lot of time verifying your changes didn't break something important on your project or product.
This is when automating your tests starts making sense.
From wikipedia
, we learn:
In software
testing
,
test automation
is the use of special software (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of
tests
and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.
Test automation has the advantage to bring down the testing time to minutes or seconds. It also saves you from making mistakes because you may be bored of manually running the tests over and over again.
Some Thoughts on Test Automation
I must admit that all my life I used the term
test automation
to describe what I do, but after reading

this white paper
from the folks at
Satisfice Inc
, I feel the need to change it. From that (very interesting) white paper:
Good testing, like programming, is instead a challenging intellectual process. Tool use in testing must therefore be mediated by people who understand the complexities of tools and of tests. This is true for testing as for development, or indeed as it is for any skilled occupation from carpentry to medicine.
The authors state that testing cannot be automated, same as programming or any other skilled occupation:
To produce high-quality products and services, we need skilled people applying appropriate tools to fulfill the mission of testing.
Conclusion: no more using the test automation term for me. I shall be a
toolsmith
from now on, since I'd like to follow the suggestion in this paragraph:
Since all testers use tools, we suggest a more interesting distinction is that some testers also make tools—writing code and creating utilities and instruments that aid in testing. We suggest calling such technical testers “toolsmiths.”
The Tool
The tool I will use for creating my tests is called
Titan
. Titan is
Ericsson's
implementation of the testing language

Eclipse Titan
Release:
6.6.0
Description:
This release introduces two new experimental Eclipse plug-ins:
-The Eclipse Java code generation plug-in
, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/blob/master/usrguide/java_referenceguide/JavaReferenceGuide.adoc
and also: “
Tutorial for the Java code generator and executor of the TITAN Eclipse
”:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/blob/master/usrguide/JavaCodegenExecTutorial.pdf
Note: due to the need to sync the C++ and Java side, a new restriction had to be introduced:
The version of the Eclipse plug-ins has to coincide with the version of the Titan core compiler and executor, else the plug-ins will not work.
This restriction is not present in versions 6.5.0 and earlier.

. In 2015, Titan got released as open source. This means I can now use it for my personal projects, and you can too.
Titan celebrated its 15th birthday some days ago so you can believe me when I tell you it's a mature tool:
Happy birthday Titan!
You can find Titan
in the Eclipse site here
. Installation instructions for Windows or Linux
can be found here
. You can look at installationguide.pdf and installationguide.pdf inside the compressed file.

Project:
Eclipse Titan
Release:
7.1.0
Description:
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains new features and backward incompatible changes.
New features:
On the C side the most important new feature is the support of the Object-Oriented Extension of the TTCN-3 standard (please note, it is a feature in progress with some features still missing as described in the Bugzilla bug 552011).
On the Java side we have greatly improved the processing speed by parallelizing some of the operations to make use of multi-core CPUs:
Titanium code smell checkers will be run in parallel
The semantic checking of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 modules will be run in parallel (when there is no dependency between the modules)
The syntactic checking (parsing) in case of project hierarchies can be run in parallel on several projects

Note1: Binaries can be also built from the latest source code available at
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core
Note2: Titan builds for RedHat X are binary compatible with CentOS X, so they can be used on the corresponding CentOS version, and vice versa.
Note 3: Builds for SuSe 11 can be used on SLED 11.x, SLES 11.x ; same for SuSe 12.
Note 4: On later Debian and Ubuntu distros the Titan executor can be installed directly from repositories.

Particle Photon
in this project, my test script can take advantage of the Particle's Cloud to communicate with it. My test in this case can "simply" run a command in my laptop, this command would invoke
the Particle CLI
, which would talk to the
Particle Cloud
, which then would talk to
my Particle Photon
Side note:
If you have never used a Particle wifi dev kit before I would suggest you give them a shot. They are really easy to start with, since they come standard with cloud connectivity. You can flash them from your browser. There is a whole ecosystem of applications around them and so many other nice things. Go get one!
Release:
5.4.0
Architectural Issues:
This is the first common release of the two major parts, the C++ based compiler/executor and the Java-based plug-ins.
Communities:
A user and adopter community started to form around Titan, as visible from the forum activity.

This is how my test setup looks like:
My test setup
The First Test
The first test will focus on testing the main use case of my thermostat, which is to heat my house if the desired temperature is higher than the current temperature.
In other words:
TEST STEP 1:
simulate that the current temperature is 20 degrees Celsius
TEST STEP 2:
set the desired temperature to 22 degrees Celsius
TEST STEP 3:
Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to ON
TEST STEP 4:
simulate that the current temperature reached 23 degrees
TEST STEP 5:
Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to OFF
My first test
That's it. In five steps, I would be verifying that my thermostat is not broken by any future change I may make in the firmware of my photon, or at least that the main use case is not broken.

Eclipse Titan
Release:
5.5.0
Description:
This version CRL 113 200/5 R5A (5.5.pl0) has the following new features:
•
clang support in Titan
As an experimental feature we have introduced support for clang 3-8.
Clang comes with the promise of (significantly) reducing the build time , however at the expense of at a reduced execution speed of the generated binary.
This means that we will not recommended it for load generating applications in production phase, but even for these, it can be used during development.
The C++ source code generated and Titan must be compiled with the same version of clang.

clang support in Titan
As an experimental feature we have introduced support for clang 3-8.
Clang comes with the promise of (significantly) reducing the build time , however at the expense of at a reduced execution speed of the generated binary.
This means that we will not recommended it for load generating applications in production phase, but even for these, it can be used during development.
The C++ source code generated and Titan must be compiled with the same version of clang.
We have published Titan built with clang-3.8 for a number of platforms.
(Note: If you need a Titan built with clang for a platform other than published, pls. let us know and we'll see if we can produce it for you;
else, you can build it from scratch yourself based on the source from github:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core)
Makefiles of TTCN-3 projects must be modified by hand as below:
# Your C++ compiler:
# (if you change the platform, you may need to change the compiler)
CXX := clang++-3.8
or regenerated using makefilegen, to use the clang compiler.
Makefilegen will check the version of the C++ compiler used when building Titan and will re-use the same in the generated Makefile.

Of course, if you want more scenarios to be covered, then more test cases can be added later.
The TTCN Code
This is the testcase coded in the TTCN language:
I purposely removed some lines to make the intent of the test clearer in this article. For the complete code please refer to the software in github.
Verification Points
If you look closely, you will notice that the test has to verify whether the fan and heat outputs are on or off at certain times (eg: when the thermostat is heating).
Since the photon does not allow you to read a pin when it's configured as output, we have to find another way.
NOTE:
technically the photon allows you to read an input when it's configured as output, just that by doing so you don't get the value of the output, but the value of an internal state of the pin. Not exactly what we want.
To overcome this kind of limitation, I created a little trick in the firmware of the Photon to make it
testable
.
Making your Project Testable
There may be many ways of making a project susceptible to being tested. Here I will list the two I thought of, just have in mind is not a conclusive list:
read the outputs with another device
keep track of the outputs states in the firmware itself
Each one is coming with its pros and cons so let's look at them side by side.

6.6.0 | projects.eclipse.org
This version has the following new features:
* License upgrade to EPL 2.0
* Documentation migrated to asciidoc
* Bugfixes for core, ASN.1, XML, RAW, OER codecs, XSD2TTCN
* New RAW coding instruction 'FORCEOMIT'
* New JSON attribute 'as map'
* Attribute 'text ... as ...' for JSON
* Adopt Makefilegen for the Debian packaging
* Support for real-time testing in TITAN
(requires support from the test port being used, see reference guide)
Added compiler option '-I', which enables the real-time testing features mentioned here.
The features are disabled by default, and the new keywords ('now', 'realtime' and 'timestamp')
can be used as identifiers again (for backward compatibility).
Also added makefilegen option '-i', which activates this option for the compiler,
and the makefile setting 'enableRealtimeTesting' in the TPD, which does the same thing.
* New flag for xsd2ttcn
-o: generate all definitions into one module (called XSD_Definitions)

Read the outputs with another device
This approach requires an extra piece of hardware. This could be an extra photon you have lying around, or any other board that we could connect to our computer running Titan, the test tool. This extra board would need to be connected electrically to the photon running the thermostat application so it can read the state of the outputs and verify they are high or low at the right times.
Pros: you know for certain what is the state of the outputs at all times, no modifications required to the firmware under test (the thermostat in our current example)
Cons: it requires an extra board
Keep track of the outputs states in the firmware itself
Pros: simple to implement, does not require an extra board
Cons: the project tested needs to be modified to call a wrapper of digitalWrite()
Which one to choose?
I chose the latter for its simplicity. You might differ in your case, and that is ok.
Surely, I had to modify the thermostat firmware. For this you will find a section called

TESTING HACKS
in the firmware (see minimalistthermostat.ino) with the sole objective of making my project testable without requiring an extra board. In that section you will find a wrapper for digitalWrite() called myDigitalWrite() and this is where the firmware keeps track of the status of its outputs.
This is the implemented wrapper:
From there you can infer that fanOutput is saving the status of the pin in the Photon's memory.
All the test has to do to find out if the fan is ON is to query that status variable.
How to query a status variable
Running the Test
Let's describe the steps required in order to run the test.
STEP 1: INSTALL TITAN

. Installation instructions for Windows or Linux
can be found here
. You can look at installationguide.pdf and installationguide.pdf inside the compressed file.
STEP 2: CLONE THE GITHUB REPOSITORY
In a folder of your choice in your laptop, create a new folder called particle. For instance in Linux, I typed in a console the following:
This creates a particle and a minimalistThermostat folder in it.
STEP 3: BUILD
Before running the test, we have to build it. Open a console and run this command:
This hopefully created a bin folder and inside you will find the binary called
minimalistThermostat
.
STEP 4: CONFIGURE
Before attempting to run the test, we need to configure the name of the photon used in the minimalistThermostat.cfg file
My photon is called cowboy_dentist, what is yours?
STEP 5: RUN
We are ready to run now. Open a console and run this command:

If all goes well, the testcase will execute and we will get a pass.
This is what we are expecting to see in the console:
That's It
We can now add new features into our project, refactor the firmware to our desire without the fear of breaking things.
By flashing the new firmware and running again our test we can rest assured that everything is working fine.
What do you think? Would you be testing your IoT projects in this way?

Story
In this article we will explore one way of testing a project with a tool designed to do just that.
Why Bother Testing?
There are many reasons why one would want to test their products or projects. We can enumerate a few from
the wikipedia definition
:
it meets the requirements that guided its design and development,
it responds correctly to all kinds of inputs,

it is sufficiently usable
In other words,
we test since we want to make sure things work properly
.
Why did I want to test my project in particular? Well, since
the project I am testing
deals with
my HVAC at home
and that is a pretty expensive piece of hardware, the drawbacks of making a mistake can cost me big bucks.
Or injure someone in my family
. Or both. So there was no way I could put my project "in production" without testing it first.
Why Automating?
Of course one can test manually all the features of a project. It just takes time to do it. Big time.
Imagine running few tests today to evaluate how good your software behaves. That's fine. Tomorrow you change a little bit and you have to test again to make sure you did not break something. Then the day after tomorrow, then next week and so on. You could end up spending a lot of time verifying your changes didn't break something important on your project or product.

This is when automating your tests starts making sense.
From wikipedia
, we learn:
In software
testing
,
test automation
is the use of special software (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of
tests
and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.
Test automation has the advantage to bring down the testing time to minutes or seconds. It also saves you from making mistakes because you may be bored of manually running the tests over and over again.
Some Thoughts on Test Automation
I must admit that all my life I used the term
test automation
to describe what I do, but after reading

Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.
Wednesday, June 21, 2017
Project:
Eclipse Titan
Release:
6.2.0
Description:
This version has the following new features:
• new compiler options:
-J: Compiler (and xsd2ttcn, makefilegen) option to read input files list from a text file
-N: ignore UNTAGGED encoding instruction on top level unions (legacy behaviour)
• support of encvalue/decvalue for ASN.1 types
• implemented: ports with translation capability
• support for concatenation of templates
• implemented 'any from' clause and index redirects with the use of the @index modifier (see standard, chapters 21-23)
• support for dynamic erroneous attributes
This release introduces two new experimental Eclipse plug-ins:
-The Eclipse Java code generation plug-in
, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/blob/master/usrguide/java_referenceguide/JavaReferenceGuide.adoc
and also: “
Tutorial for the Java code generator and executor of the TITAN Eclipse
”:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/blob/master/usrguide/JavaCodegenExecTutorial.pdf
Note: due to the need to sync the C++ and Java side, a new restriction had to be introduced:
The version of the Eclipse plug-ins has to coincide with the version of the Titan core compiler and executor, else the plug-ins will not work.
This restriction is not present in versions 6.5.0 and earlier.
-
The Eclipse Refactoring plug-in
, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.EclipsePlug-ins/blob/master/org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring/docs/Titanium_Refactoring_Description/Titanium_Refactoring_Description.adoc
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains the follwing new features:
Support for real-time testing in TITAN(continued from 6.5.0)

from the folks at
Satisfice Inc
, I feel the need to change it. From that (very interesting) white paper:
Good testing, like programming, is instead a challenging intellectual process. Tool use in testing must therefore be mediated by people who understand the complexities of tools and of tests. This is true for testing as for development, or indeed as it is for any skilled occupation from carpentry to medicine.
The authors state that testing cannot be automated, same as programming or any other skilled occupation:
To produce high-quality products and services, we need skilled people applying appropriate tools to fulfill the mission of testing.
Conclusion: no more using the test automation term for me. I shall be a
toolsmith
from now on, since I'd like to follow the suggestion in this paragraph:
Since all testers use tools, we suggest a more interesting distinction is that some testers also make tools—writing code and creating utilities and instruments that aid in testing. We suggest calling such technical testers “toolsmiths.”
The Tool
The tool I will use for creating my tests is called
Titan
. Titan is
TTCN
. In 2015, Titan got released as open source. This means I can now use it for my personal projects, and you can too.
Titan celebrated its 15th birthday some days ago so you can believe me when I tell you it's a mature tool:
On the Java side we have greatly improved the processing speed by parallelizing some of the operations to make use of multi-core CPUs:
Titanium code smell checkers will be run in parallel
The semantic checking of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 modules will be run in parallel (when there is no dependency between the modules)
The syntactic checking (parsing) in case of project hierarchies can be run in parallel on several projects
Also on the Java side we have added support for JSON encoding/decoding.
Backward incomaptible changes:
'omit' matching mechanism is no longer allowed for union fields
To fix a compilation issue in the Java code generator when used with very large modules we had to change where the typedescriptors are generated into the generated code.

Happy birthday Titan!
You can find Titan
in the Eclipse site here
. Installation instructions for Windows or Linux
can be found here
. You can look at installationguide.pdf and installationguide.pdf inside the compressed file.
The Test Setup
In this article, I will take one of my existing projects and verify that the main flow (
or use case
) works properly. For this, I will create
a test case
or feature
, of it).
Since I am using a
Particle Photon
in this project, my test script can take advantage of the Particle's Cloud to communicate with it. My test in this case can "simply" run a command in my laptop, this command would invoke

the Particle CLI
, which would talk to the
Particle Cloud
, which then would talk to
my Particle Photon
Side note:
If you have never used a Particle wifi dev kit before I would suggest you give them a shot. They are really easy to start with, since they come standard with cloud connectivity. You can flash them from your browser. There is a whole ecosystem of applications around them and so many other nice things. Go get one!
This is how my test setup looks like:
My test setup
The First Test
The first test will focus on testing the main use case of my thermostat, which is to heat my house if the desired temperature is higher than the current temperature.
In other words:
TEST STEP 1:
simulate that the current temperature is 20 degrees Celsius
TEST STEP 2:
set the desired temperature to 22 degrees Celsius

TEST STEP 3:
Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to ON
TEST STEP 4:
simulate that the current temperature reached 23 degrees
TEST STEP 5:
Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to OFF
My first test
That's it. In five steps, I would be verifying that my thermostat is not broken by any future change I may make in the firmware of my photon, or at least that the main use case is not broken.
Of course, if you want more scenarios to be covered, then more test cases can be added later.
The TTCN Code
This is the testcase coded in the TTCN language:
I purposely removed some lines to make the intent of the test clearer in this article. For the complete code please refer to the software in github.
Verification Points
If you look closely, you will notice that the test has to verify whether the fan and heat outputs are on or off at certain times (eg: when the thermostat is heating).
Since the photon does not allow you to read a pin when it's configured as output, we have to find another way.
NOTE:
technically the photon allows you to read an input when it's configured as output, just that by doing so you don't get the value of the output, but the value of an internal state of the pin. Not exactly what we want.

To overcome this kind of limitation, I created a little trick in the firmware of the Photon to make it
testable
.
Making your Project Testable
There may be many ways of making a project susceptible to being tested. Here I will list the two I thought of, just have in mind is not a conclusive list:
read the outputs with another device
keep track of the outputs states in the firmware itself
Each one is coming with its pros and cons so let's look at them side by side.
Read the outputs with another device
This approach requires an extra piece of hardware. This could be an extra photon you have lying around, or any other board that we could connect to our computer running Titan, the test tool. This extra board would need to be connected electrically to the photon running the thermostat application so it can read the state of the outputs and verify they are high or low at the right times.
Pros: you know for certain what is the state of the outputs at all times, no modifications required to the firmware under test (the thermostat in our current example)
Cons: it requires an extra board
Keep track of the outputs states in the firmware itself
Pros: simple to implement, does not require an extra board
Cons: the project tested needs to be modified to call a wrapper of digitalWrite()
Which one to choose?

I chose the latter for its simplicity. You might differ in your case, and that is ok.
Surely, I had to modify the thermostat firmware. For this you will find a section called
TESTING HACKS
in the firmware (see minimalistthermostat.ino) with the sole objective of making my project testable without requiring an extra board. In that section you will find a wrapper for digitalWrite() called myDigitalWrite() and this is where the firmware keeps track of the status of its outputs.
This is the implemented wrapper:
From there you can infer that fanOutput is saving the status of the pin in the Photon's memory.
All the test has to do to find out if the fan is ON is to query that status variable.
How to query a status variable
Running the Test
Let's describe the steps required in order to run the test.
STEP 1: INSTALL TITAN
You can find Titan
in the Eclipse site here
. Installation instructions for Windows or Linux

. You can look at installationguide.pdf and installationguide.pdf inside the compressed file.
STEP 2: CLONE THE GITHUB REPOSITORY
In a folder of your choice in your laptop, create a new folder called particle. For instance in Linux, I typed in a console the following:
This creates a particle and a minimalistThermostat folder in it.
STEP 3: BUILD
Before running the test, we have to build it. Open a console and run this command:
This hopefully created a bin folder and inside you will find the binary called
minimalistThermostat
.
STEP 4: CONFIGURE
Before attempting to run the test, we need to configure the name of the photon used in the minimalistThermostat.cfg file
My photon is called cowboy_dentist, what is yours?
STEP 5: RUN

We are ready to run now. Open a console and run this command:
STEP 6: VERIFY
If all goes well, the testcase will execute and we will get a pass.
This is what we are expecting to see in the console:
That's It
We can now add new features into our project, refactor the firmware to our desire without the fear of breaking things.
By flashing the new firmware and running again our test we can rest assured that everything is working fine.
What do you think? Would you be testing your IoT projects in this way?

This repo is intended to collect TTCN-3 based applications, demo and instructional code etc.
VSBOT is a vulnerability scanner based on TTCN-3
Currently scans for web application vulnerabilities, namely directory traversal, SQL injection and XSS; next to this, it also contains a SYN Flood generator. This is not necessarily meant for industrial usage, it's rather a prototype that can constitute a good starting point to build your own vulnerability scanning application. The execution is based on TTCN-3 code executed by Titan, with a number of building blocks from the Titan toolbox(test ports etc.) and it also has a Python-based GUI.
Note: As this repository includes submodules, after cloning it, a 'git submodule init' and a 'git submodule update' will have to be issued.
SIP_ETSI is based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Test Suite from ETSI

make clean; make
ttcn3_start SocketCAN SocketCAN.cfg or ttcn3_start SocketCAN CAN_matrix_test.cfg
or to run a certain testcase:
ttcn3_start SocketCAN SocketCAN.cfg SocketCAN_RAW_test.tc_can_raw_send_and_receive_can_frame SocketCAN_RAW_test.tc_can_raw_setsockopt_CAN_RAW_FILTER
Review the newly created log files in the src directory and use e.g. Wireshark to trace the CAN interfacce.
#-------------------------------------- Notes: -Using multiple Test interfacces: Currently the init script sets up multiple virtual can interfaces ("vcan0", "vcan1" in oder to allow using multiple CAN interfaces. The CAN interfaces have to be defined in the TTCN configuration files or may alternatively be defined in the optional parameters of port messages commands ioctl and send_data.
Handling of multiple CAN interfaces is work in progress and no test cases are provided. In order to configure usage with multiple test interfaces, test interfaces for each interface have to be defined in the MTC.
First install the isotp kernel module as descibed here:
https://github.com/hartkopp/can-isotp-modules
./make_isotp.sh sudo insmod ./can-isotp.ko
There is an endlessly running test case: ttcn3_start SocketCAN SocketCAN.cfg Isotptest.tc_Isotp_Example001
-CAN J1939: Configure CAN J1939 as following (requires Kernel 5.4 and compiled with can-j1939 kernel module): sudo modprobe vcan sudo ip link add vcan0 type vcan sudo ip link set vcan0 up sudo modprobe can-j1939
For the following test cases, the messages are so huge that screen output of the log file takes too long. Thus comment out as following the following lines in J1939.cfg: //FileMask := LOG_ALL | DEBUG | MATCHING //ConsoleMask := LOG_ALL | DEBUG | MATCHING
ttcn3_start SocketCAN J1939.cfg SocketCAN_J1939_test.tc_can_j1939_send_and_receive_message ttcn3_start SocketCAN J1939.cfg SocketCAN_J1939_test.tc_can_j1939_send_and_receive_message_parallel

Compatibility:
Incompatibilities:
· warning changed to error when ‘*’ is used for mandatory elements
· infinity/NaN not allowed at timer start
* Documentation migrated to asciidoc
* Bugfixes for core, ASN.1, XML, RAW, OER codecs, XSD2TTCN
* New RAW coding instruction 'FORCEOMIT'
* New JSON attribute 'as map'
* Attribute 'text ... as ...' for JSON
* Adopt Makefilegen for the Debian packaging
* Support for real-time testing in TITAN
(requires support from the test port being used, see reference guide)
Added compiler option '-I', which enables the real-time testing features mentioned here.
The features are disabled by default, and the new keywords ('now', 'realtime' and 'timestamp')
can be used as identifiers again (for backward compatibility).
Also added makefilegen option '-i', which activates this option for the compiler,
and the makefile setting 'enableRealtimeTesting' in the TPD, which does the same thing.
* New flag for xsd2ttcn
-o: generate all definitions into one module (called XSD_Definitions)
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:

clang support in Titan
As an experimental feature we have introduced support for clang 3-8.
Clang comes with the promise of (significantly) reducing the build time , however at the expense of at a reduced execution speed of the generated binary.
This means that we will not recommended it for load generating applications in production phase, but even for these, it can be used during development.
The C++ source code generated and Titan must be compiled with the same version of clang.
We have published Titan built with clang-3.8 for a number of platforms.
(Note: If you need a Titan built with clang for a platform other than published, pls. let us know and we'll see if we can produce it for you;
else, you can build it from scratch yourself based on the source from github:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core)
Makefiles of TTCN-3 projects must be modified by hand as below:
# Your C++ compiler:
# (if you change the platform, you may need to change the compiler)
CXX := clang++-3.8
or regenerated using makefilegen, to use the clang compiler.
Makefilegen will check the version of the C++ compiler used when building Titan and will re-use the same in the generated Makefile.

TCC Useful Functions CNL 113 472 R22B
Compatibility:
Template(present) should accept complement matching:
-M compiler option:
Enforces legacy behavior when matching the value omit. Allows the use of the value omit in template lists and complemented template lists, giving the user another way to declare templates that match omitted fields. If set, an omitted field will match a template list, if the value omit appears in the list, and it will match a complemented template list, if omit is not in the list (the ifpresent attribute can still be used for matching omitted fields). This also affects the ispresent operation and the present template restriction accordingly.
Target Environments:
Pre-built binaries are made available for:
Linux (GCC 4.3.4, 64-bit, SuSE Enterprise Server 11.1)

Review Information
Information in support of the graduation review:
A working and demonstrable code base with extensible frameworks and exemplary tools
An active framework user (plug-in provider) community.
The received contribution reflect the versatility of the tool itself:
-CANBus test port
-LTTng logger plug-in
-CoAP protocol module additions
An active user community.
The size and activity of the user community can be assessed through the Eclipse Titan forum, which is the main communication channel with our users; questions and observations can be posted here; it is also a media where we post notes and guides about
new or modified features of the tool. Some of these posts have been read by tens of thousands , with a post reaching an audience of nearly 100.000 readers. We also see a continuous stream of downloads of the source code (Github) and published binaries.
An active multi-organization community.
We have seen adopters, users and contributors for many organizations.
Titan became the backbone of several large IoT testing projects:

Report a Bug
The limitations present in the Designer plug-in also apply here: there are TTCN-3 language constructs which are not yet supported in the current version, while there are also some non-standard extensions implemented by TITAN. Information on these limitations and extensions and also some clarifications of how the standard has been implemented in TITAN, can be found in the
TITAN Programmer’s Technical Reference
.
1.4. Intended audience
This document is intended for users of the TITAN TTCN-3 Test Toolset (product number: CRL 113 200/1).
1.5. Presumed knowledge
This document is intended to be read by users already familiar with the TITAN Designer toolset. For this reason this document includes TITAN related information only when necessary.
Note
This document does not wish to describe elements of Eclipse or Titan, and how to use them. Every time such a feature is described, it is done with simplicity in mind, assuming a minimal level of experience with Integrated Development Environments from the user. However, it is advised to read the manuals of Eclipse and Titan Designer (mainly contained in its included help system), because it can provide better descriptions of the elements.
1.6. Typographical conventions
This document uses the following typographical conventions:
Bold
is used to represent graphical user interface (GUI) components such as buttons, menus, menu items, dialog box options, fields and keywords, as well as menu commands. Bold is also used with "+" to represent key combinations. For example,

-J: Compiler (and xsd2ttcn, makefilegen) option to read input files list from a text file
-N: ignore UNTAGGED encoding instruction on top level unions (legacy behaviour)
• support of encvalue/decvalue for ASN.1 types
• implemented: ports with translation capability
• support for concatenation of templates
• implemented 'any from' clause and index redirects with the use of the @index modifier (see standard, chapters 21-23)
• support for dynamic erroneous attributes
• implemented @fuzzy support
•
no support of Solaris binaries from this release of Titan (older versions of course will continue to support Solaris)
• makefilegen more restrictive on name attribute of the referenced project
• makefilegen: remove generated headers dependency from all .c .cc files
(This will revert the following bugs: Bug 499963 - The generated Makefile does not make full build
when -j switch is present ; Bug 512688 - makefilegen: Incorrect .c and .cc compiling rule )
• XER: allow anytype to be xer enc/decodable

Project:
Eclipse Titan
Release:
6.3.0
Description:
Information in support of the graduation review:
A working and demonstrable code base with extensible frameworks and exemplary tools
An active framework user (plug-in provider) community.
The received contribution reflect the versatility of the tool itself:
-CANBus test port
-LTTng logger plug-in
-CoAP protocol module additions
An active user community.
The size and activity of the user community can be assessed through the Eclipse Titan forum, which is the main communication channel with our users; questions and observations can be posted here; it is also a media where we post notes and guides about
new or modified features of the tool. Some of these posts have been read by tens of thousands , with a post reaching an audience of nearly 100.000 readers. We also see a continuous stream of downloads of the source code (Github) and published binaries.
An active multi-organization community.
https://www.netdevconf.org/2.2/session.html?welte-ttcn3-talk
It is also worth to mention the interest of academia and research for Titan, as reflected in a number of scholarly articles, such as:
Titan TTCN-3 Based Test Framework for Resource Constrained Systems
https://www.matec-conferences.org/articles/matecconf/pdf/2016/38/matecconf_icmie2016_06005.pdf

Project:
Eclipse Titan
Release:
6.4.0
Description:
This release is mainly a corrective release, it introduces no major new features. No backward incompatibilities are to be expected, with maybe one exception we see as a minor risk: the fix for
Bug 533767 - RAW encoder ALIGN(right) is working according of specification of ALIGN(left) (and vice versa) for octetstring
may induce under some unlikely circumstances an incompatible behaviour.
This version has the following new features:
Implement verdict redirect for 'done' statement
str2float should handle special float values
RT2 record equality
string2ttcn to filter patterns of visible characters in octetstrings

The slash (/) character is used to denote a menu and sub-menu sequence. For example,
File / Open
.
Monospaced
font is used to represent system elements such as command and parameter names, program and path names, URLs, directory names and code examples.
1.7. Installation
For details on installing the TitaniumRefactoring plug-in, see the Installation Guide for TITAN Designer and TITAN Executor for the Eclipse IDE [1].
1.8. How to report an error for the tool
The following information should be included into trouble reports:
a short description of the problem;
what seems to have caused it, or how it can be reproduced;
If the problem is graphical in some way (displaying something wrong), screenshots should also be included;
Output appearing on the TITAN Console or the TITAN Debug Console;
contents of the Error view if it contains some relevant information;
Before reporting a trouble, try to identify whether the trouble really relates to the Titanium plug-in. It might be caused by other third party plug-ins, or by Eclipse itself.

The source code is hosted publicly partly on GitHub, partly on Eclipse Git repositories.
Bugs and change requests are reported in Eclipse.org's Bugzilla. Discussions are taking place mainly on the Eclipse Titan forum,
or if they are directly code-related, in GitHub, where the contributor workflow is also published.
OpenHub statistics of the Eclipse Titan project:
https://www.openhub.net/p/eclipse_titan/
The project team members have learned the ropes and logistics of being an Eclipse project
We adhere to all processes and policies recommended by the Eclipse organisation.
This version has the following new features:
New compiler options:

Reporting the contents of the Consoles and the Error log is important as TITAN consoles might display important debug information. The location on which the Error Log view can be opened can change with Eclipse versions, but it is usually found at
Window / Show View / Other… / PDE Runtime / Error Log
or
Window / Show View / Other… / General / Error Log
.
2. Getting started
This section explains how to setup Eclipse and the TITAN Designer to access every feature provided by TitaniumRefactoring.
2.1. The perspective
TitaniumRefactoring does not provide its own perspective, for convenience we recommend using the "TITAN Editing" perspective.
For those who have not yet used the TITAN Designer before, it is recommended to read chapter "The TITAN Editing perspective" of the TITAN Designer’s user guide on how to set up a default perspective for working with TTCN-3.
2.2. Setting workbench preferences
In Eclipse, workbench preferences are used to set user specific general rules, which apply to every project; for example, preferred font styles, access to version handling systems and so on.
Workbench preferences are accessible selecting
Window / Preferences
. Clicking on the menu item will bring up the preferences page.
This section only concerns the preferences that are available under the TITAN preferences node of this preference tree. There are no preferences in this window concerning the TitaniumRefactoring plugin.

Description:
Information in support of the graduation review:
A working and demonstrable code base with extensible frameworks and exemplary tools
An active framework user (plug-in provider) community.
The setting of the TITAN
license file
is mandatory for the refactoring features to work. Without a valid license the TITAN Designer plug-in will not create the semantic data, that the TitaniumRefactoring plug-in requires to work on.
Note
In case the license file is not provided, is not valid or has expired an additional link will appear on this page. Clicking on this link a browser will open directing the user to a web page where he can order a new license or can ask for a renewal of his existing one.
3. Actions
The TitaniumRefactoring plug-in extends some of the context-sensitive menus of Eclipse where appropriate, providing a convenient way to use the available tools.
3.1. Editor actions
Figure 2. Editor actions context menu
While editing a TTCN-3 source file, the context menu can be opened by right clicking in the editor on some selection. Under the TitaniumRefactoring menu item, the available actions on this file can be found.
Extract definition into a new project:
Copies the selected definition and all of its dependencies to a new project. See Section 4 for details.
Lazy-fication of formal parameters:
Automatically detects formal module parameters where applying the @lazy modifier would be beneficial see section 11 for details.
Minimize visibility modifiers in module:

We have seen adopters, users and contributors for many organizations.
Titan became the backbone of several large IoT testing projects:
oneM2MTester:
https://github.com/IoTKETI/oneM2MTester
IoT-T:
http://www.iot-t.de/en/testware/
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.iottestware
ARMOUR 2020:
Minimizes all visibility modifiers in a single module. This means, that all the definitions in the module which can be private are given a private visibility modifier. See Section 6 for details.
Expand value list notation in module:
Automatically transforms values given with value list notation into assignment notation.
Order value list notation in module:
Automatically correct the order of elements in assignment notation to mimic the order seen in the type of the value.
Add context info to log statements:
Adds context info to log statements in the selected piece of code. See Section 7 for details.
Extract module parameters into a new project:
Extracts all module parameters and all of their dependencies from an entire project into a new project. See Section 8 for details.
This is a complex refactoring operation that is able to automatically delete unused variables, move the declaration of variables closer to the first usage, if needed into a smaller scope unit.
Organize imports:
Automatically organizes the import statements into lexicographical order, removing all unused imports.
Ungroup module parameters in module:
For all instances where module parameters are declared using the deprecated grouped syntax, automatically replaces them with a separated list of the same module parameters.

We have also seen small-to-medium businesses adopting Titan as part of their test tool portfolio.
The project is operating fully in the open using open source rules of engagement
The source code is hosted publicly partly on GitHub, partly on Eclipse Git repositories.
Bugs and change requests are reported in Eclipse.org's Bugzilla. Discussions are taking place mainly on the Eclipse Titan forum,
or if they are directly code-related, in GitHub, where the contributor workflow is also published.

This version has the following new features:
New compiler options:
-D: disable user and time information generation in the generated files
The TitaniumRefactoring plug-in offers some commands which can be called in headless mode. This way it can be used from command line, and for example integrated into nightly build systems.
It is important to note, that as in this mode there is no interaction between eclipse and the user, all of the settings should be set beforehand. Otherwise the operation might not be able to work properly, or produce un-expected result.
4.1. Important settings
There are two settings that are always important to be set correctly; otherwise the headless mode will not be able to operate correctly:
The license file has to be set in the Designer and it has to be active, otherwise the on-the-fly analyser will not be able to execute.
The "
Display debug information
" setting in the Designer has to be turned off. If that option is turned on, the Designer will try to write debug information to the Titan Debug Console … which does not exist in headless mode and the execution aborts.
The on-the-fly analysis of code smells must be enabled on the Code smells preference page under Titanium Preferences, otherwise only the Designer will check the code.
4.2. The general structure of invocation
A generic call to a headless entry point of eclipse follows this pattern:
The items in this call have the following meaning:
Eclipse.exe
: this is the binary executable of Eclipse to be used.

Allow viewing logs in different presentation formats, like graphical. tabular/textual etc.
To help start using the toolset, a few popular,
existing
IP-based transports and protocols are also submitted to open source.
The following test ports (see the description section) are included into this proposal:
TCP, UDP, TELNET,
SQL,
PIPE (creating and executing command line shells from TTCN-3), SCTP, HTTP, PCAP (reading wireshark traces into TTCN-3), LANL2 (handling Ethernet frames), SIP, and Abstract Socket (it is not a test port on is own, but a library handling the TCP socket of the Linux kernel; it is used in our test ports and making it easy to develop any new test port that is using TCP).
See more information on the test port's capabilities in the Description section.
The following protocol modules are also included into this proposal:
DHCP, DHCPv6, DNS, DIAMETER, ICMP, ICMPv6, XMPP, RTP, RTSP, SMTP, SNMP.
Any further test ports, protocol modules or generic, non-domain specific libraries, developed by contributors wil be part of this project, as they are technically closely related to the tool (due to using the test port API and message/signal encoding control of Titan).
Eclipse Titan can be used for automated testing by developing test frameworks and test cases manually. But, when

5.1. Usage
To extract a definition and all of its dependencies to a new project, right click on a definition identifier in the editor window and choose
TitaniumRefactoring / Extract definition
from the context menu. If the type of the selection is not supported for the operation, an error message is displayed in the status bar.
If the selection is supported for the operation, then a wizard dialog is presented for the user to specify the name of the new project. Project names that are already present in the workspace are not accepted. After entering the name and clicking on the
Finish
button, the new project is created and added to the workspace.

5.2. Headless mode
The plug-in also can be called in headless mode, this way it can be used from command line, and for example integrated into nightly build systems.
The entry point can be invoked as:
5.3. Known limitations
Please note that the "Extract definition" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported; their whole content will be copied without selection.
Note
The algorithm ignores missing references in the source project.

Test frameworks are domain-specific and often specific to the system under test (SUT), e.g. through managing the SUT via its management interface or accessing the SUTs internal status and data using embedded components. Sharing of libraries and frameworks developed by (Titan) users and contributors is important to the success of the test system, but due to their domain-specific nature they should not be part of this project but should create other projects, related to this one.

Description:
This release is mainly a corrective release, it introduces no major new features. No backward incompatibilities are to be expected, with maybe one exception we see as a minor risk: the fix for
Bug 533767 - RAW encoder ALIGN(right) is working according of specification of ALIGN(left) (and vice versa) for octetstring
may induce under some unlikely circumstances an incompatible behaviour.
This version has the following new features:
Implement verdict redirect for 'done' statement
str2float should handle special float values
RT2 record equality
string2ttcn to filter patterns of visible characters in octetstrings
Syntax to bind a variant attribute to multiple encodings
TITAN build on Alpine Linux
new tpd tag disableUserInformation
runs on scope reduction (Titanium)
Add discarding option to 'setstate' operation
Notify user if port is not mapped in translation mode

9. Expend value list notation
While it might be tempting to save development time, on not writing out field names in value list notations, this can cause problems during maintenance. During maintenance reviewing a large data structure, where the values are listed without direct information on what they are assigned to, can add an unnecessary complexity and slow down the effort. Using this feature, such value list notations are automatically expanded with the names of the fields, making navigation and understanding much easier.
Examples:
9.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select
TitaniumRefactoring / Expand value list notation in module
from the TTCN-3 editor’s right-click context menu.
To use the operation on any number of files, folders or projects, select
TitaniumRefactoring / Expend value list notation
from the Project Explorer right-click context menu.
A wizard dialog is presented for the user to review the changes, before executing them.
9.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Expand value list notation" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported.

It can easily happen during the development of a test system, that a value given with an assignment notation, does not follow the order of the original type. During maintenance this can cause problems. For example checking that a value of a set type has its fields set to the right value, in case of different field ordering, provide an overhead of tracking which field of the type is where in the value. Using this feature, such assignment list notations are automatically reordered to reflect the order of fields in the original type, making navigation and understanding much easier.
Examples:
10.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select
TitaniumRefactoring / Order assignment list notation in module
from the TTCN-3 editor’s right-click context menu.
To use the operation on any number of files, folders or projects, select
TitaniumRefactoring / Order assignment list notation
from the Project Explorer right-click context menu.
A wizard dialog is presented for the user to review the changes, before executing them.
10.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Order assignment list notation" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported.
11. Add context info to log statements

Figure 9. Minimize scope wizard � modify settings
13.1.1. Settings
Move variable declarations:
If this option is disabled, variable declarations will not be moved (just removed if unused and other settings and circumstances allow this)
Move variable declarations when their scope is correct:
If this option is disabled, variable declarations will only be moved to a new location if their scope could be narrower.
Remove unused variables:
Removes unused variable declarations.
Avoid moving variables with unchecked references in their declaration statements (disabling may alter the refactored code behaviour):
Some reference types in a variable declaration are currently not checked for other occurrences in the code. If this option is disabled and a variable declaration contains such unchecked references, then moving this variable (possibly beyond a left-hand-side occurrence of this specific unchecked variable) may result in the change of the code behaviour.
Avoid moving and/or taking apart declaration lists (unused variables can still be removed from them):
When large declaration lists with many declarations are moved, the current algorithm doesn’t preserve the declaration list itself, but creates individual declaration statements for each variable declaration. Sometimes this can be annoying, so disabling this option leaves all variables declared in declaration lists unmoved. Unused entries can still be removed from these declaration lists.
13.2. Algorithm behaviour
The main steps of the refactoring operation are the following:

Status message
This proposal has been approved and the

project has been created.
Eclipse Titan
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
The new scope of a variable V is calculated as the smallest common containing block of all references of this variable let this scope be S.
If the variable V declaration does not contain references to any other variables, then the new location of the declaration is inside S (the new scope), just before the first reference to variable V let this location be L.
If the variable V declaration does contain references to other variables, then all left hand side usages (before the location L, but after the declaration of V) of these other variables are collected and their smallest common containing block is calculated. Let this be S2. The new scope of the variable V will become the smallest common containing block of S and S2 (for clarity: a block contains itself in this case) Let this be S3. The new location of the declaration will be in S3 right before the location of the first reference to V or the first left hand side reference mentioned above (the earliest of these).
If the calculated new scope of a variable is a loop block, then the new scope is going to be the smallest ancestor block of the loop block which is not greater than the original scope. Moving a variable declaration into a loop block even when all references are inside the loop block may result in changed behaviour.

Eclipse Tools Project
Background:
ETSI
(European Telecommunications Standards Institute) was specifying the TTCN-3 (Test and Test Control Notation version 3 - note that the name has been changed in a way leaving the abbreviation intact) test language, and it was a natural choice to use it for the new tool's prototype. In 2003 it was decided to replace the earlier TTCN-2 based test toolset by a more modern and powerful one. After a year of investigation, Titan was further developed (TTCN-3 semantic analysis, GUI, ASN.1 support etc. added). and TTCN-2 test suites were completely replaced by TTCN-3. The Titan toolset has been evolving continuously during the last decade, and is now a proven industrial-strength product with over 4000 active licenses.
Titan
This project proposal, will use the current name of the toolset that is well-known within Ericsson.
What Titan is:
Titan is the TTCN-3-based test toolset

integration and execution environment for test cases generated from models.
Titan supports attended and unattended (nightly) automatic test execution as well as exploratory testing.
Titan can be efficiently used for small testing tasks as well as for huge and complex test scenarios, where the tester has to communicate with the tested entity via many interfaces in a test case, at the same time. A test suite (including a test framework) of about 1M TTCN-3 LOC exists and is being used.
Titan Eclipse components contain approximately 300,000 LOC in Java, the other components contain about 1,600,000 LOC in C++ and other languages (including tests).
What Titan is not?
Titan is not a GUI testing tool.
Titan is not a test tool for low-level high capacity traffic like (Giga)Ethernet, SDH, ATM etc.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 (
Test and Test Control Notation version 3)
is the standard test specification language, developed and maintained by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (
ETSI
). It is also a worldwide standard as has been endorsed by the
ITU-T
without technical changes. ETSI standards and ITU-T's TTCN-3 Recommendations are available for free of charge to
everyone

Issue found while building the 3gpp conformance code in ttcn.
By:
http://www.ttcn-3.org
.
A rich bibliography of TTCN-3 related papers can be found at
Fraunhofer Fokus's TTCN-3
site and
Bernard Stepien's
website.
What TTCN-3 is:
"The standardized testing language has the look and feel of a regular programming language but without the complexity that such languages often introduce, as it concentrates exclusively on testing. There are many tutorial and courses to learn TTCN-3, as well as a certification program. The standard itself provides examples that demonstrate the usage of the specific features of the language. The aim of TTCN-3 is to provide a well-defined syntax for the definition of tests independent of any application domain. The abstract nature of a TTCN-3 test system makes it possible to adapt a test system to any test environment. This separation significantly reduces the effort required for maintenance allows experts to concentrate on what to test and not on how."
Source:
http://www.ttcn-3.org
/index.php/about/why-use-ttcn3
See more details in the Descriptions section.
What TTCN-3 is not:
TTCN-3 is not a telecom-specific language. It is a generic-purpose test language,
TTCN-3 is suited for a large variety of application domains:
Mobile and fixed-line communications, telecommunication networks (LTE, WiMAX, 3G, TETRA, GSM, ISDN, SS7 etc.)
from the context menu. If the type of the selection is not supported for the operation, an error message is displayed in the status bar.
If the selection is supported for the operation, then a wizard dialog is presented for the user to specify the position, name, type and value of the new field. Names that are already present in the selected type definition are not accepted. After this, the produced changes can be reviewed and accepted by clicking on the Finish button.
17.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Insert field" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported, and so will be skipped by the algorithm.
Note
The algorithm does not check if the type and the value of the new field are valid.
18. Change union to select union
The TTCN-3 standard has been extended recently with the select union statement, to provide better support for the situation, when several execution path are possible based on the currently selected field of a union typed value. As the below example shows, previously select statements could be used for this purpose, but were lacking. The new syntax not only communicates its purpose better, but also allows for checking if all possible fields are covered (leading to safer code).
Examples:
18.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select
TitaniumRefactoring / Change union to select union
from the TTCN-3 editor’s right-click context menu.

TTCN-3 is not object oriented, it is a procedural language. One of the design principles was to specify an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use language.
TTCN-3 is not designed for developing applications, it is a testing language. Nevertheless, several protocols have been implemented with rational limitations in TTCN-3 to bridge the actually tested layer(s) and the truly available transport layers within the test tool.
Standard test suites and libraries
Several standard test suites are available. We have information that TTCN-3 is used e.g. in the automotive industry, however our knowledge is limited to test suites available from 3GPP and ETSI. Test suites for
mobile and fixed-line communication,
Intelligent Transport Services (ITS), ePassport, etc. are available
from these organizations. These are produced for conformance, network integration/end-to-end and interoperability testing.
See more information at
http://www.ttcn-3.org/index.php/downloads/publicts/publicts-etsi
.
Except test suites, ETSI also publishes a number of TTCN-3 libraries for the IP version 6, SIP, Diameter protocols and for ITS. See available libraries at

Creation Review
Proposal:
Eclipse Titan
Parent Project:
Eclipse Tools Project
Background:
ETSI
(European Telecommunications Standards Institute) was specifying the TTCN-3 (Test and Test Control Notation version 3 - note that the name has been changed in a way leaving the abbreviation intact) test language, and it was a natural choice to use it for the new tool's prototype. In 2003 it was decided to replace the earlier TTCN-2 based test toolset by a more modern and powerful one. After a year of investigation, Titan was further developed (TTCN-3 semantic analysis, GUI, ASN.1 support etc. added). and TTCN-2 test suites were completely replaced by TTCN-3. The Titan toolset has been evolving continuously during the last decade, and is now a proven industrial-strength product with over 4000 active licenses.

IP-based transports and protocols are also submitted to open source.
The following test ports (see the description section) are included into this proposal:
TCP, UDP, TELNET,
SQL,
PIPE (creating and executing command line shells from TTCN-3), SCTP, HTTP, PCAP (reading wireshark traces into TTCN-3), LANL2 (handling Ethernet frames), SIP, and Abstract Socket (it is not a test port on is own, but a library handling the TCP socket of the Linux kernel; it is used in our test ports and making it easy to develop any new test port that is using TCP).
See more information on the test port's capabilities in the Description section.
The following protocol modules are also included into this proposal:
DHCP, DHCPv6, DNS, DIAMETER, ICMP, ICMPv6, XMPP, RTP, RTSP, SMTP, SNMP.
Any further test ports, protocol modules or generic, non-domain specific libraries, developed by contributors wil be part of this project, as they are technically closely related to the tool (due to using the test port API and message/signal encoding control of Titan).
Titan can be used for automated testing by developing test frameworks and test cases manually. But, when
integrating it with modeling tools
Test frameworks are domain-specific and often specific to the system under test (SUT), e.g. through managing the SUT via its management interface or accessing the SUTs internal status and data using embedded components. Sharing of libraries and frameworks developed by (Titan) users and contributors is important to the success of the test system, but due to their domain-specific nature they should not be part of this project but should create other projects, related to this one.
Description:
Titan provides an Eclipse-based IDE for TTCN-3. The user of the tool can develop test cases, test execution logic and build the executable test suite for one or more platforms.

Titan
This project proposal, will use the current name of the toolset that is well-known within Ericsson.
What Titan is:
Titan is the TTCN-3-based test toolset
widely
used
within Ericsson
, providing Eclipse-based and command line user interfaces, and multi-platform support.
Titan is an
integration and execution environment for test cases generated from models.
Titan supports attended and unattended (nightly) automatic test execution as well as exploratory testing.
Titan can be efficiently used for small testing tasks as well as for huge and complex test scenarios, where the tester has to communicate with the tested entity via many interfaces in a test case, at the same time. A test suite (including a test framework) of about 1M TTCN-3 LOC exists and is being used.
Titan Eclipse components contain approximately 300,000 LOC in Java, the other components contain about 1,600,000 LOC in C++ and other languages (including tests).
What Titan is not?
Titan is not a GUI testing tool.
Titan is not a test tool for low-level high capacity traffic like (Giga)Ethernet, SDH, ATM etc.

Titan
Titan compiles and executes test cases. It has four major roles:
*
The TTCN-3
design environment provides
an efficient way to create the TTCN-3 test suites (called the abstract test suite, ATS). The IDE is Eclipse‑based and is called Titan Designer.
It has editors
that provide the usual IDE features
for TTCN-3, ASN.1 and the Titan runtime configuration file. Like creating and configuring Titan projects, syntax highlighting, name convention checking, jump to definition, on-the-fly syntax and semantic analysis, simple content assist, outline of the module
s, mark occurrences etc. ASN.
1 and XSD sources are typically not created by testers, but are coming from specifications. Nevertheless Titan contains a full-featured ASN.1 editor. XSD sources can be viewed, edited and validated by using any
Eclipse
XML editors capable of validating XSD.
The Designer also allows building the project. It has a built-in Makefile generator for GNU and GCC makes and allows setting Titan compiler and GCC compiler and linker flags. The source code is first compiled by the Titan compiler to C++ code, then external C++ compiler and linker are called to build the executable file (which is called the host controller -
HC
). The whole building process is invoked and controlled by the Designer and is running in a command line shell in the background .

TTCN-3 (
Test and Test Control Notation version 3)
is the standard test specification language, developed and maintained by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (
ETSI
). It is also a worldwide standard as has been endorsed by the
ITU-T
without technical changes. ETSI standards and ITU-T's TTCN-3 Recommendations are available for free of charge to
everyone
.

Question regarding mapping of components and parameters
By:
Moritz Klass
on
The Titan compiler builds an
executable test suite
(
ETS
) from the ATS, the test port code (see below) and the Titan runtime library. The ETS is not always directly executable as the TTCN-3 language and Titan allows very flexible runtime parameterization of the test cases (e.g. IP addresses, port numbers etc. in the lab); the values of runtime parameters need not be defined in development time - though default values can be specified-, but they can be provided just before the test execution session. In this way flexible execution scenarios can be created without re-building the ETS;
*
Titan
runtime control
has several tasks:
- the Titan
Main Controller (MC)
read and distributes to all test components the runtime configuration parameters;
- it controls the execution of test cases in a distributed multiplatform environment;
- it keeps up and running the test system: in case of a runtime error, Titan runtime control cleans up the test system, assigns an "error" verdict to the given test case and starts execution of the next test case);
- it produces logs in different formats; Titan has a logging API and

"The standardized testing language has the look and feel of a regular programming language but without the complexity that such languages often introduce, as it concentrates exclusively on testing. There are many tutorial and courses to learn TTCN-3, as well as a certification program. The standard itself provides examples that demonstrate the usage of the specific features of the language. The aim of TTCN-3 is to provide a well-defined syntax for the definition of tests independent of any application domain. The abstract nature of a TTCN-3 test system makes it possible to adapt a test system to any test environment. This separation significantly reduces the effort required for maintenance allows experts to concentrate on what to test and not on how."

What TTCN-3 is not:
TTCN-3 is not a telecom-specific language. It is a generic-purpose test language,
TTCN-3 is suited for a large variety of application domains:
Mobile and fixed-line communications, telecommunication networks (LTE, WiMAX, 3G, TETRA, GSM, ISDN, SS7 etc.)
Broadband technologies (ATM, DSL)
Middleware platforms (WebServices, CORBA, CCM, EJB)
Internet protocols, IP-based networks and applications (SIP, IMS, IPv6, SIGTRAN, XMPP, SOAP and REST based web services and many more)
Smart Cards, ePassport
Automotive (AUTOSAR, MOST, CAN)
TTCN-3 is not object oriented, it is a procedural language. One of the design principles was to specify an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use language.
TTCN-3 is not designed for developing applications, it is a testing language. Nevertheless, several protocols have been implemented with rational limitations in TTCN-3 to bridge the actually tested layer(s) and the truly available transport layers within the test tool.

LogViewer
help analyzing the test results. These tools currently
processing Titan's own log format only.
In a model-based testing (MBT) scenario, the test cases generated from the model are necessarily abstract, as the model itself does not contain low level information. Therefore the abstract test cases has to be completed by a test harness, to become executable test cases. TTCN-3 and Titan
in several projects
have proved
to be
an ideal platform for
developing
the test harness, for integrating the generated abstract test cases with the test harness and the test environment, and for test execution
.
Though Titan is told to be "a TTCN-3 test tool", in fact it is able to use TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD and IDL specifications describing the message and signal
structures at the tested interfaces. ASN.1 is imported directly, while XSD and IDL are first converted to TTCN-3 and then the generated TTCN-3 modules are used in the projects. In case of XSD the TTCN-3 module is decorated with XML encoding instructions. Titan also supports codec control decorators in TTCN-3 files for binary and textual protocol encodings. Defining the test configurations and the dynamic behaviour of the tests are written in TTCN-3. Functions written in C/C++ can be also be called in the TTCN-3 code.
Titan consists of the following components, these are all subject of this project:

Name
Function
Implementation language
TCP
Provides communicatin over TCP-type connections in IP networks. It uses the Absrtact Socket library, therefore its supports the features of the Abstract Socket described below. Connections can be static for the time of the test case (opened/starts listening at the TTCN-3 map operation and closed at unmap) or can be opened/closed dynamically from the TTCN-3 code. Multiple TCP connections are supported by one port instance.
C++
UDP
Provides UDP-type connections
in IP networks
. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's UDP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port can handle multiple UDP connections.
C++
TELNET
Allows using remote telnet login from TTCN-3 via the TCP layer of the operating system. The test port supports client and server mode operation. In server mode operation the Telnet Test Port can handle one connection simultaneously. Supports the capabilities of Network Virtual Terminal. Telnet connection parameters (login creadentials, terminal type, prompt format with or without wildcards etc.) can be configured in Titan's runtime configuration file.
C++
SQL
The SQL test port executes SQL statement against the SQL database. The SQL test port is able to handle different SQL engines and databases, and provides an unified interface towards them. Currently MySQL, SQLite C API-s are supported (and required from the database).
Main Controller (MC)
read and distributes to all test components the runtime configuration parameters;
- it controls the execution of test cases in a distributed multiplatform environment;
- it keeps up and running the test system: in case of a runtime error, Titan runtime control cleans up the test system, assigns an "error" verdict to the given test case and starts execution of the next test case);
- it produces logs in different formats; Titan has a logging API and
logging
is done via plugins. Currently we have plugins for Titan’s own textual log format and for Jenkins
(junit format)
. Thus, developing a new logging plugin, e.g. for LTTng doesn’t require much
knowledge
of Titan's
code

PIPE
The PIPE test port is developed to execute shell commands from the TTCN-3 test suite. It provides abstract service primitives to communicate with the user. The stdin, stdout and stderr of the process are returned to the user.
C++
SCTP
ProvidesSCTP-type connections
in IP networks
. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's SCTP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port instance can handle multiple SCTP connections in either server or client mode.
C++
HTTP
Allows sending and receiving HTTP messages between the test suite and SUT via a TCP/IP connection. It uses the Abstract Socket library. Both IP version 4 and 6 are supported and it can handle multiple connections.
C++
PCAP
The PCAP test port has basically two operating modes.
In reading mode
, it is able to process recorded network traffic, saved in a file in libpcap format (used e.g. also by the open source Wireshark tool), and decode various application layer protocol messages. These messages are then delivered to TTCN-3.
In capturing mode
everal logging mechanisms may be activated at the same time. L
ogging can be configured by verbosity and by event types. Logs can be written into files or be send to another process or via a network connection to a 3

Java code generator/executor of Titan
the test port can be used to capture Ethernet packets to a file, controlled from the TTCN-3 environment.
Filtering of messages can be set both at capturing and reading modes.
C++
LANL2
Allows communicating with the SUT at the low level Ethernet connectivity. The test port translates the LANL2 service primitives (ASPs) and messages (PDUs) sent from the TTCN-3 code to Ethernet II frames when sending and translates the received packets to LANL2 ASPs att receipt. The test port uses the Packet Socket on Linux and the DLPI interface on Solaris (using DLIOCRAW mode).
C++
SIP
Handles SIP connections; The test port can handle SIP request and SIP response messages and it can use both UDP and TCP connection to send and receive messages. The built in encoder can encode SIP request and SIP response messages and it is possible to send raw and fragmented [28] messages trough the test port. The name of the header can be encoded in short or long format.
In
basic mode
the test port can handle only one TCP connection or one UDP socket. It is not possible to send and receive messages using both protocols at the same time, but the test port can switch between protocols and remote hosts.
In advanced mode
the test port can handle several TCP connections and listen on both UDP and TCP ports at the same time. Each connection is distinguished by the protocol id, remote host name and the remote port number.
The test port used to be compatible with ETSI's SIP type definitions, therefore
ETSI SIP library
could be used with it. ETSI has slightly changed one of its type definition lately, therefore the test port needs to be updated to be compatible with ETSI's
LibSip v2.0
an ideal platform for
developing
the test harness, for integrating the generated abstract test cases with the test harness and the test environment, and for test execution
.
Though Titan is told to be "a TTCN-3 test tool", in fact it is able to use TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD and IDL specifications describing the message and signal
structures at the tested interfaces. ASN.1 is imported directly, while XSD and IDL are first converted to TTCN-3 and then the generated TTCN-3 modules are used in the projects. In case of XSD the TTCN-3 module is decorated with XML encoding instructions. Titan also supports codec control decorators in TTCN-3 files for binary and textual protocol encodings. Defining the test configurations and the dynamic behaviour of the tests are written in TTCN-3. Functions written in C/C++ can be also be called in the TTCN-3 code.

C++
Abstract Socket
It is not a test port, but a library that can be used to build test ports that are using the TCP internet protocol connection; it uses the services provided by the UNIX socket interface and implements basic sending, receiving and socket handling routines. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6, client and server modes and also supports SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1secure connections (the used secure protocol is selected during the SSL handshake automatically).
C++
Protocol Modules
Protocol modules implements static data structure and message encoding/decoding, defined in the specification of the given protocol. Protocols are most often
specified by standard bodies for the interfaces, where equipments of different vendors may or need communicate with each other, but of course, interface specifications may also be vendor-specific.
Protocol modules can support both cases and shall be in TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD, or IDL (Corba). JSON support is being developed currently. The protocol modules made available in this project proposal are all defined by IETF and all these specifications are publically available.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 is a high-level, abstract language. The code itself is platform independent (e.g. no integer value range or float precision requirements in the language, these are defined by tool implementations; memory allocation is completely solved by tools).
TTCN-3 is test environment independent. In TTCN-3 only the abstract messages/signals, exchanged between the test system and the tested entity (SUT, AUT, etc.) are defined, the transport layers and connections are provided and handled by the tools. Message/signal encoding (serialization) and decoding (deserialization) is completely done by the tool in the background. The user, if wants, can access the encoded data in TTCN-3, and the encoded data is also logged for debugging purposes. TTCN-3 also allows leaving data open in the source code and providing the actual values at execution time (i.e. typically IP- and other addresses, IDs and passwords, SUT/AUT parameters for automatic test case selection etc.). All this allows executing the test cases, unchanged, on different platforms and in different test environments.
The TTCN-3 language has four major parts:
A rich data/type system
Eclipse plugin, offline log representation in tabular and graphical (UML SD-like) formats
Java
Titanium
Eclipse plugin for code quality analysis (identifies code smells, draws module dependency graph)
Java
TTCN-3 and ASN.1 compiler
Command line parser, semantic analyzer and C++ code generator. Input files can be TTCN-3 and ASN.1.
C++

t allows describing the messages/signals of practically all possible protocols and APIs.
Except defining data structures in TTCN-3, the language specify the ways of importing other data type/schema languages - as ASN.1, IDL, XSD and currently JSON mapping is being defined, i.e. using them in TTCN-3 test suites without the need of manual conversion. TTCN-3 can also be used as a schema language for XML and JSON (ongoing).
As an extension, Titan also allows adding encoding instructions to TTCN-3 types to automatically encode them in binary (bit-oriented) or (simple) textual forms, XML or JSON (for ASN.1 data BER/CED/DER encodings are supported).
Test configuration
TTCN-3 allows defining multi-process distributed test cases and test execution logic easily (processes are called “test components”). It is the tools' responsibility to deploy and control the test components on the available pool of machines, possibly running different OS-es. The user need not bother about the details (see also the example below). Types of the test components and their interfaces (ports) to other test components and the tested entity are defined in TTCN-3. The number of test component instances and their port connections are controlled from the test case code dynamically, using built-in language statements.
Test dynamic behaviour
TTCN-3 is a procedural programming language specialized for testing. This means that is has the usual programming language features and in addition, constructs needed for testing are built-in the
language. S
ending/receiving messages, checking the content of the incoming messages, alternative test behaviours depending on the response of the tested entity(including no answer), handling timers and timeouts, logging of events, verdict assignment and collection from the different components of the test system and alike.
Test execution control
Test case execution logic and dynamic test selection can be controlled from the TTCN-3 code itself.
TTCN-3 is a dynamically developing language. In 2003, at publication of its first implemented version, it consisted of two documents (core language and operational semantics), 316 pages in total. In 2005, in TTCN-3 edition 3, tool implementation parts and interworking with ASN.1 has been added and the language specification was published in 7 documents, on 846 pages in total. The first version of TTCN-3 edition 4, in 2009, added interworking with IDL and XSD that increased the number of published pages to 948 in 8 documents (two earlier parts had been made historical in edition 4) . From 2010 language extensions for real time and performance testing, configuration and deployment, testing of interfaces with continuous signals and some advanced language features are published in separate language extension documents. Up to now 6 language extension packages have been published and today, in June 2014, the whole language specification consists of 1422 pages in 14 documents. ETSI is securing the maintenance and development of the language by establishing a project team from ETSI members. The project is financed from ETSI budget.
Example

Test Ports
The TTCN-3 code is generic: the interfaces between the tester and the tested entity (SUT, AUT etc.) are specified at the level of the exchanged abstract data messages and signals.
S
etting up and maintaining the transport connections, and sending/receving "real" messages and signals are the tasks of interface adaptors.
Adaptors are called test ports (TPs) and are plugins written in C++
. Titan has a C++ API for adaptors that complete the ATS with the connectivity layer(s) between the test system and the SUT.

Test case results are extracted automatically from it and by clicking on a test case, its log is opened either in a graphical or in a textual/tabular form. In the middle window of the upper row the graphical view the fragment of the last execution of TC can be seen, when the string is received by the PTC and the

By clicking on the "charstring", its content is opening in a value window that can be seen in the window below the graphical log window and at the same time the source code line producing the log event is highlighted in the TTCN-3 editor (rigth window of the middle row). The left window of the top row allows selecting the test cases/control part to be executed and shows the actual status of test components during test case runs.
Why Here?:
Eclipse Foundation is a perfect place for the Titan project for the following reasons:
existing Eclipse IDE, code QA, test execution control and result analysis tools.
the Polarsys project targets robust industry-grade toolset, Titan is such a tool and it targets Polarsys
TTCN-3 and Titan is an ideal target language and tool for model based testing. Modeling support and tools exist in Eclipse, but no support for model based testing (MBT). Titan can complement the existing modeling tools to create a complete MBT environment from modeling to test execution and result (log) evaluation. Such project proposal is being submitted by CEA List, with agreement and co-operation from us.
Licenses:
Eclipse Public License 1.0
Legal Issues:
There is no known legal issues with the Titan and test port code or the TTCN-3 language.

Titan is developed for the POSIX environment, but it is possible to use it on Windows platforms on top of cygwin. In this case (but not in the Linux and Solaris versions), it also uses the runtime library libcygwin.a of cygwin.
Name License
Cygwin By default GPLv3+, but cygwin license contains the following exception clause for using it with open source
SW (see
https://cygwin.com/licensing.html
):
"
Cygwin™ Open Source Licensing Exception
As a special exception to GPLv3+, Red Hat grants you permission to link software whose sources are distributed under a license that satisfies the Open Source Definition with libcygwin.a, without libcygwin.a itself causing the resulting program to be covered by GPLv3+.
This means that you can port an Open Source application to Cygwin™, and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of libcygwin.a linked into it. Note that this does not apply to the Cygwin™ DLL itself. If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of the Cygwin™ DLL, you must adhere to the terms of the GPLv3+, including the requirement to provide sources for the Cygwin™ DLL, unless you have obtained a special Cygwin™ license to distribute the Cygwin™ DLL in only its binary form (see below).

Cygwin itself will not be delivered with Titan and will not be kept in the Titan project's repository (with the possible exception of libcygwin.a). It will be the users' responsibility to install the correct version of cygwin, including Cygwin™ DLL, if Titan is used on machines running Windows OS. Therefore this arrangement will fulfill the preconditions of the above exception.
It is possible to build a limited-capability native Windows version of the Titan compiler and xsd2ttcn converter. This version provides syntax and semantic checks of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 sources and converting XSD documents to TTCN-3 modules

. Standardization bodies, as 3GPP, like to use this version, as they are developing the code but do not execute the test cases themselves, and many people are using Windows (test cases are verified by members on real implementations and issues found in the test cases are reported back as change requests). In this version of Titan the MINGW 3rd Party library is used:

Project Scheduling:
The initial contribution is already available. It will be contributed as soon as the project creation process is finished successfully.
Future Work:
Titan will further be developed in Ericsson and the changed and new code be submitted to this project. Other future developments depend on further contributors to the project and their needs.
In parallel with this project proposal, a related project is being proposed by CEA List of the topic "
Model based formal verification and validation
". These two proposals are complementing each other with the aim to create a complete model-based-testing environment, from model specification to test generation, test execution and test result analysis. In the current stage the test cases generated from the model can be integrated with TTCN-3 based test harnesses and be executed using Titan. This will require aligning the code generator's output with the test harness interfaces and/or APIs manually. The two tools are seen by the user as two separate tools currently. We plan closer integration later, but at the point time details are not yet known as the technical discussions are still ahead of us.
We are planning to take several actions to build the community. We plan to announce open sourcing Titan and promote it at the
UCAAT
and
HUSTEF
conferences in September-October 2014. We plan to create a flyer, public website, newsletter and introduction video. Also we are planning to disseminate information about open source Titan in the traditional TTCN-3 community places as the
