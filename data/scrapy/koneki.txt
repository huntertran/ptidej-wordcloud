Type: ReleaseState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, January 29, 2014Project: KonekiRelease:
1.1.0
Description: The 1.1 version focuses on improving user-assistance for Lua Development Tools.
Architectural Issues: No outstanding architectural issue.
Better communication with DLTK Team, but the lack of ressource on DLTK project is still a problem.
Non-Code Aspects: User documentation is available on wiki.
Not sure our last version is still in babel. (we should check this for next release)
Usability Details: Several improvement on user assistance and outline make autocompletion useable with less knowledge of documentation language.
User assistance and formatter improvement make LDT more compliant with Lua spirit .
New debug custimization facility impoves LDT extensibility.
Still some issue with debugger configuration is some "non standard" use case.
End of Life: No new features are being deprecated.
Communities: New committer : Julien Desgats.
Stable users base.
Good activity on koneki forum. A few bugs reported in bugzilla (It seems most users prefer to use our forum).

Koneki 1.2.0 Release Review
Type: ReleaseState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, May 28, 2014Project: KonekiRelease ReviewRelease:
1.2.0
Description: This release focus on user assistance and debugger enhancements.
API Certification: The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".Architectural Issues:
We think about removing the DLTK dependency, maybe we can start with an internal fork.
Non-Code Aspects:
User documentation is available on wiki.
Not sure our last version is still in babel.
Usability Details:
Several improvement on documentation language allow users to better describe their API.
There 're probably missing a way to extend the tooling with simple lua script.
End of Life: No new features are being deprecated.
Communities: Stable users base.
Good activity on koneki forum. A few bugs reported in bugzilla (It seems most users prefer to use our forum).
LDT will probably move in its own project .(The proposal is available here.)

Koneki 1.1.0
Primary tabsOverview
Issues
Release Plan
Review Information(active tab)
Description: The 1.1 version focuses on improving user-assistance for Lua Development Tools.
Architectural Issues: No outstanding architectural issue.
Better communication with DLTK Team, but the lack of ressource on DLTK project is still a problem.
Non-Code Aspects: User documentation is available on wiki.
Not sure our last version is still in babel. (we should check this for next release)
Usability Details: Several improvement on user assistance and outline make autocompletion useable with less knowledge of documentation language.
User assistance and formatter improvement make LDT more compliant with Lua spirit .
New debug custimization facility impoves LDT extensibility.
Still some issue with debugger configuration is some "non standard" use case.
End of Life: No new features are being deprecated.
Communities: New committer : Julien Desgats.

A new feature or improvement of an existing one
Priority
Definition
P1
Must be fixed within the current milestone.
P2
Must be fixed before the release.
P3
Would be fixed before release, if possible.
P4
Would be probably fixed someday.
P5
Not important to our long-term plans.
Update sites organization
The active Hudson jobs perform the continuous integration of LDT projects and deploy signed p2 repos to the nightly update sites.
TODO Switch to LDT update sites
There are 2 kind of nightly updates sites (repositories) :
nightly: /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/ldt/updates-nightly, which is a composite repo of the last successful builds of the 'master' branch of each Koneki projects.

nightly-maintenance: /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/ldt/updates-nightly-maintenance, which is the same one but for the active maintenance branch.
All the last releases are stored in /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/ldt/releases repository which is composed of :
stable: /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/ldt/releases/stable which contains all the last stable releases.
milestones: /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/ldt/releases/milestones which contains all the last milestones.
Previous releases can be found in at /home/data/httpd/archive.eclipse.org/ldt/releases. (with the same structure)
APITools
All the org.eclipse.ldt* plugins are checked against APITools to ensure the consistence of LDT public API.
When checkouting the code in an eclipse workspace, you must set an API baseline used by APITool check your development against, in our case, the API baseline have to be the last stable version of the LDT standalone product. To work on the LDT remote feature, you have to install the last stable version of remote feature in the product used as reference.
The API baseline can be set in the eclipse preference under the menu "Plug-in development/Api baseline".
To go further with Api Tool, see the related wiki: http://wiki.eclipse.org/PDE/API_Tools.

Koneki
The Koneki project is a proposed open source incubator project under
the Eclipse
Technology Project.
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the Eclipse
Proposals Forum.
Background
[Wikipedia] : Machine-to-Machine (M2M) refers to technologies that
allow both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices
of the same ability.
When first faced with the assignment of setting up a remote
management and supervision system for devices scattered over a large
geographical area, a developer faces miscellaneous and usually tricky

engineering problems.
Embedded application development complexity
- Because it is very close to the underlying hardware, embedded
development can turn out to be a complex task, especially considering
the fact that people developing M2M solutions are domain experts
(healthcare, smart grid, …), not necessarily software
specialists.
Variety of M2M embedded modules - There are
many M2M-capable devices available on the market, and they all come
with different operating systems (although Linux seems to become the
norm), different APIs to communicate with a distant server (over
HTTP, TCP, or whatever) or with a "local" asset (serial protocol,
Modbus, ZigBee®, …). This fragmentation makes it very difficult
to come up with reusable, portable, software.
Scope
The main goal of the proposed project is to provide

Machine-to-Machine solutions developers with tools easing the
development, simulation, testing/debugging and deployment of such
solutions.
More specifically, Koneki aims at:
Enabling M2M development
support for languages and runtimes used to develop M2M
applications, with a specific focus on Lua (ligthweight language,
very well-suited for M2M applications)
support for communication protocols used in M2M
applications
smooth integration of M2M servers
Establishing an M2M application model
Providing tooling built on top of this application model to
Lua Development Tools | Eclipse Plugins, Bundles and Products - Eclipse Marketplace
improve M2M development experience.
As detailed in the Background paragraph, there are many
flavors of M2M modules, vendor SDKs, communication protocols, etc. ;
the proposed project will therefore define and expose the APIs needed
to support M2M development in the large.
Description
The Koneki project goal will be to deliver a first-class
development environment for M2M solutions developers.
Here are the key features that the Koneki project aims at
providing:
M2M Embedded
Development
Language tools — Koneki will rely
on existing language development tools (CDT, JDT, DLTK-based
editors, …) to give the M2M developer access to usual editing
features (syntax highlighting, content assist, outlines, …).

ease the use of M2M embedded runtimes: remote configuration, remote
application deployment/debugging, shell access, …
M2M application generation — Koneki
will provide an extensible generation infrastructure built on top
of the M2M application model.
Application examples —
Machine-to-Machine solution developers are not necessarily skilled
embedded developers (e.g. a solution to remotely control an
industrial equipment will likely be developed by a control
engineer), the Koneki project will therefore focus on providing the
developer with embedded application templates and examples.
Protocols
Koneki project will provide the user with utilities to
manipulate M2M & industrial protocols: encode/decode binary
frames, perform bandwidth usage simulation according to different
Details Group Tabs
Details
Lua Development Tools (LDT) is about providing Lua developers with an IDE providing the user experience developers expect from any other tool dedicated to a static programming language.
Like many other dynamic languages, Lua is so flexible that it is hard to analyze enough to provide relevant and powerful tooling.
LDT is using Metalua, to analyze Lua source code and provide nice user assistance.
LDT is an Open Source tool, licensed under the EPL.
Visit Lua Development Tools web page for more information, and make sure you are encouraging the development team by favoriting LDT on the Marketplace!Categories: Programming LanguagesTags: Lua, ldt, IDE, tools, editor, debugger

existing protocol simulators/emulators.
M2M Server
Development
Koneki will define an abstraction (a la WST Server Adapter)
of what an M2M server is. It will allow M2M services providers to
implement their own connector, and developers to easily configure
the server-side model of their application, discover the Web
Services exposed by the server, etc.

generic simulation infrastructure to allow developer to test
different communication policies (and their consequences on
bandwidth consumption), monitor data transfers, simulate
communication failures, etc.
Application examples — Koneki may
package exemplary end-user applications to illustrate the use of
M2M server APIs.
M2M Model
Application model — Koneki will
implement an M2M application model allowing an M2M solution
developer to create an abstract definition of the capabilities of
an M2M application (communication capabilities, exposed variables,
communication policy, supported remote commands, …).
Application editors — Koneki will
provide high-level editors (forms, diagrams, DSL-based editors) of
M2M application models, assisting the developer with the design of
his/her embedded application.

Primary tabsOverview
Why Eclipse?
The Koneki project has relationships with many Eclipse projects
and the Koneki team will closely collaborate with these projects
since:
Lua tooling relies on DLTK 2,
“EMF Forms” (PDE Incubator) is used for easing
the development of form-based editors,
Tools TM (Terminal and RSE components) is used to communicate
with embedded devices,
Modeling projects (EMF, EMF Transaction, GMF) support the
M2M application model,
Koneki will work even more closely with eTrice (MDT project) and
Yakindu (EclipseLabs project at the moment) teams to establish an M2M
application/component model.
In addition, an Eclipse M2M Industry Working Group will likely

be created to help industrial partners and tool vendors to come up
with a reference environment to develop M2M solutions. Having Koneki
at eclipse.org is the best way to ensure a good collaboration between
the Koneki team and the members of the Working Group in charge of
identifying M2M tooling requirements.
Initial Contribution
The Koneki project will be seeded with an initial contribution
from Sierra Wireless in the form of the following tools:
A set of plug-ins to suppport the Lua language: editor,
content-assist, packaging, …
A set of plug-ins to ease Linux target communication: remote
project copy, remote application launch, debugging …
A packaging mechanism of M2M applications examples,
A prototype of a component model for M2M applications, based
on a dataflow paradigm,
A graphical editor on top of this component model to give the
developer the ability to visualize and modify its application

based upon the Koneki

started
——
One of the biggest challenges companies are faced with
when building M2M solutions is that they have to deal with a lot of
engineering problems, from embedded development to web development
– including industrial protocols like manipulation – and there are
many different tools to address these different tasks. Koneki aims

to provide a set of tools that put them all in a single place. Just
a year after its creation, the Koneki project is part of the
Eclipse Juno simultaneous release.
Koneki you say? Koneki is a word from the Māori language that
means “this place”. The goal of this project is to deliver tools
that integrate seamlessly into the Eclipse environment and to allow
an M2M developer to develop, simulate and test his or her
application more easily. On the next few pages, you will learn more
about Machine-to-Machine (M2M), and will be walked through the most
interesting features of Koneki.
Introduction to Machine-to-Machine
You may be familiar with the term Internet of
Things (IoT). Both that and M2M come down to the same
idea of connecting virtually every object you can think of to the
Internet – allowing devices to share important data, as well as to
be remotely controlled.
By 2020, there will be around 50 billion connected

There are many domains of everyday life where M2M
is changing the way we interact with objects, and it is opening the
door to a tremendous number of applications. One good example of
such a domain is healthcare, illustrated in Figure
1. Connecting things such as blood pressure or
heartbeat sensors to the Internet enables third parties to create
modern web or mobile applications using the collected data, while
enabling the sensors’ manufacturers themselves to upgrade them
remotely.
Figure 1: M2M applied to the healthcare market
However, most of the M2M solutions already deployed
usually rely on proprietary technologies and communication
protocols, which seriously hinders the growth of the M2M

M2M Industry Working Group Initative
At the end of last year, a number of members of the
M2M ecosystem decided to create an Industry Working Group under the
umbrella of the Eclipse Foundation to address the main issue of
solutions currently being developed: their lack of
interoperability. The objective of the M2M Industry Working Group
(M2MIWG) is to collaborate on providing the enablers for M2M
solutions development: communication libraries, application
frameworks, and development tools (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Creating an open M2M ecosystem
There are at the moment two Eclipse Technology
projects coordinated by the M2M Industry Working Group:
Paho and Koneki (EDITOR’S NOTE: Mihini arrived
in August, not longer after publication date)
Paho is a project that aims to provide
implementations of lightweight protocols that can be used in M2M

and IoT applications. The initial contribution to the project is
from IBM and Eurotech, in the form of C and Java client libraries
for the MQTT protocol. MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is
a messaging protocol over TCP/IP enabling bandwidth-efficient
exchanges between communicating devices.
As stated in the introduction of this article,
Koneki’s goal is to deliver tools that simplify the development of
end-to-end solutions, from the creation of embedded applications to
the simulation of communication scenarios, including the
development of end-user applications.
Lua, a very lightweight yet
powerful programming language
Lua (pronounced “loo-ah”) is a
programming language invented in Brazil in 1993. It was originally
designed to be easy to embed into other applications. As a
consequence, it is very lightweight and written in pure ANSI-C,

which makes it easily portable to various platforms as small as
microcontrollers with only a few hundreds of kilobytes of RAM and
Flash. There is also an optimized flavor of Lua, called eLua, which goes a step further in
terms of optimizing the Lua runtime for very constrained
targets.
Lua is very easy to learn, and many
vendors of game and mobile development platforms now propose it as
the primary language for writing applications.
Lua for Machine-to-Machine
Development
You may wonder why the biggest component of Koneki
is an IDE for Lua, called Lua Development Tools (LDT), and not
something with a stronger M2M focus. The answer is very simple: We
believe that one of the biggest obstacles to create industrial M2M
solutions is the complexity to develop the applications that are
embedded on the communicating devices on the field.
But keep in mind that there are many domains with

business opportunities for M2M solutions, and people do not want to
have to learn a complex language such as C, when all they want to
do is manipulate a few data structures and send them to a remote
server. What if Lua could be used to simplify the development of
embedded applications, thus following the path of numerous mobile
and game? Lua is very easy to learn and used by many vendors of
game and mobile development platforms.
Getting Started
with Lua Development Tools
Lua Development Tools can be installed either from
the Juno repository (in the Programming Languages
category) or from the Eclipse Marketplace. The easiest way for you
to start using LDT is by creating a new project using the
File | New | Other… | Lua Project wizard. You can
either start an empty project, or reference existing Lua sources.
When finishing your wizard, you will be asked to switch to the Lua
perspective (which you should use!) – and voilà!

User Assistance
In order to provide a really smooth experience for
developers not necessarily familiar with programming in the first
place, it was important to have first-class Lua support in
Koneki.
Lua is a dynamic language, which means that it can
be very tricky to provide content-assist, code navigation, etc.
when there is no typing nor real distinction between variables,
Languages Toolkit), which helps in providing basic code editing
features, but we had to work on enriching the code parsing so the
IDE can be —to some extent— type-aware.
One of the key enablers of this feature is that we
worked on the definition of a documentation language that allows a
fine description of Lua modules’ APIs. Not only does it allow to
offer nice documentation views and pop-ups (à la Javadoc), but it
is also what makes content-assist possible, as well as code

with virtually any Lua runtime. It comes in the form of a DBGp
(DeBuG protocol) client written in Lua, which can instrument a Lua
script to make it talk to the debugging server running in the
IDE.
In order to use the debugger, you just need to
include two files (debugger.lua and
debugintrospection.lua) in your Lua path, and add the
following statement before the code you actually want to debug:
“require(‘debugger’)()”. It is also possible to
automatically inject the debugger into any existing script by using
the following command-line syntax: “lua -e
“require(‘debugger’)();” MyApp.lua”.
Since debugging works by opening a server in the
IDE, you have to launch your debug configuration prior to running
the instrumented Lua script. Creating a debug configuration is done
via the usual Run | Debug Configurations… menu

As long as your Lua virtual machine is not too
funky (e. g. it is better to have loadstring support),
basically every debugging feature you would get when developing for
Java will be available to you: breakpoints (including conditional
breakpoints), variables exploration and modification, interactive
expressions, console, multi-threading (coroutines) debugging, etc.

M2M model
While it is still at a very early stage, we are
working on the definition of a model of M2M applications whose goal
will be to express important information such as: data manipulated
by an application as well as the protocols used to exchange this
data with other actors of an M2M solution, dependencies towards
specific hardware capabilities or software libraries, etc.
We believe that such a model will facilitate the
creation of extensible tools, by allowing third parties to develop
their own extensions, for example, a bandwidth estimator for a

specific communication protocol. We also think that this model can
be leveraged at runtime, for example by letting an M2M developer
have data access APIs that hide the complexity inherent to the
serialization/deserialization of data on the wire.
The first version of this M2M model is already
available in the Git
repository of the project, and focuses on the description of
the data manipulated by an application. It addresses the specifics
of M2M, for example by allowing a distinction to be made between
data that is to be only sent to another machine vs. data
that can also be updated remotely, or to describe
operations that can be executed remotely.
Figure 6: Koneki’s data model applied to an M2MIWG use case
The requirements for this M2M model are
discussed within the M2M Industry Working Group, where real-life
use cases are used to nail down the core notions that the model
should cover.

À l'occasion de la sortie de la nouvelle version 3.7 de la plateforme Eclipse, nommée Indigo, les associations Toulibre et JUG Toulouse organisent une après-midi autour du Logiciel Libre Eclipse, avec conférences et démonstrations. Les conférences seront animées par des personnalités de la communauté francophone d'Eclipse.
L'événement, ouvert à tous, libre et gratuit, se déroulera le jeudi 23 juin de 13h à 21h à l'École Nationale Supérieure d'Électrotechnique, d'Électronique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des Télécommunications, Toulouse. Les détails d'accès sont disponibles sur le site de l'ENSEEIHT.

En parallèle de l'Eclipse Party, la mêlée numérique organise le premier OpenDay à Toulouse sur le thème : “Quelles alternatives aux systèmes d’information propriétaires ?”
Eclipse
Eclipse est un environnement de développement intégré libre extensible, universel et polyvalent, permettant de créer des projets de développement mettant en œuvre n'importe quel langage de programmation.
Dès l'origine du projet, IBM a voulu offrir une solution multiplate-forme, pouvant être exécutée sur les différents systèmes d'exploitation de ses clients. La spécificité d'Eclipse IDE vient du fait de son architecture totalement développée autour de la notion de plugin (en conformité avec la norme OSGi).

Coming next
You may wonder what is to be expected for the next
releases of Koneki, especially what we will do to add more M2M
content to Koneki. Our next hot topic is to work on the
contribution of a Lua application framework that could run on
virtually any kind of Linux platform, and would simplify the remote
management of the system, the IOs manipulations, the access to the
network, etc. We are also looking at addressing the huge community
of makers and hobbyists who demand a platform that would simplify
access to communication APIs (SMS, 3G connectivity, etc.), remote
management of embedded systems (over-the-air firmware upgrade,
monitoring of network status), and so forth.
Also, the Koneki team is really looking forward to
working on providing a complete M2M-oriented modeling environment,
together with the Damos team. Damos is a
recently proposed Eclipse Tools project whose scope is to provide
an integrated development environment for developing data
flow-oriented systems using block diagrams.

Les nouveautés Topcased dans Indigo et MDT Papyrus, par Pierre Gaufillet et Tristan Faure
Basé sur Indigo, TOPCASED 5.0.0 sera publié cet été. Nous présenterons lors de cette session la plate-forme de modélisation TOPCASED et son utilisation en entreprise, en prêtant une attention particulière à ses nouveautés et aux fonctionnalités de MDT Papyrus - un modeleur UML/SysML issu de la fusion de plusieurs projets open source, hautement personnalisable et adapté aux environnements industriels. Pleinement compatible avec les différents outils TOPCASED tels que la gestion de la traçabilité des exigences, la vérification de modèles via OCL ou la génération de code & documents, MDT Papyrus remplacera progressivement les éditeurs TOPCASED UML/SysML.
Tristan Faure est commiter TOPCASED et MDT Papyrus. Impliqué sur l'ensemble des développements Eclipse RCP et EMF à Atos Origin il a la tâche de développer l’utilisation du Model Driven Engineering dans le cadre de ses différentes missions.

M2M & Open Source chez Eclipse : le projet Koneki, par Benjamin Cabé
Koneki est un nouveau projet Eclipse (Technology incubator) dont le but
est de proposer aux développeurs de solutions Machine-to-Machine (M2M) un
ensemble d'outils adapté à leurs problématiques. Ces outils doivent
permettre de faciliter le développement, la simulation, le test et le
déploiement de telles solutions tout en partageant un socle technologique
commun.
La présentation se focalisera dans un premier temps sur les
problématiques particulières liées au développement embarqué, qui est
central dans le M2M, et insistera en particulier sur les technologies
Eclipse qui permettent de les adresser. L'accent sera mis par la suite sur
le développement de solutions M2M en particulier et sur les solutions
inédites que Koneki mettra en œuvre (support avancé des langages de

Architectures des logiciels Java : OSGi, RCP, EMF des réponses open source industrielles, par Olivier Prouvost
Le développement d'applications industrielles en Java peut devenir rapidement complexe. Quelles règles adopter pour la conception ? Comment gérer les versions ? Comment organiser les composants entre eux ? Comment gérer les mises à jour ? Quelle bibliothèque graphique utiliser ? Comment gérer mes tests ?… A ces nombreuses questions, l'architectures OSGi, l'infrastructure RCP et les outils de modélisation comme EMF, apportent une réponse industrielle pour ce type de problèmes. Cette présentation exposera les avantages de ces technologies open sources, et l'intérêt de les combiner pour bâtir des applications riches et évolutives.
Olivier Prouvost travaille depuis plus de 20 ans dans les nouvelles technologies, dont les technologies Eclipse depuis 2004. Il est le fondateur de la société OPCoach, spécialisée dans l'expertise et la formation sur les technologies Eclipse.

Table ronde - L'écosystème Eclipse : Utilisateurs, Contributeurs, Commiteurs, Project leaders, Consultants indépendants, Salariés, Entrepreneurs, Communauté... et vous, animée par Gaël Blondelle
La fondation Eclipse a développé un écosystème riche de millions d'utilisateurs, de milliers de contributeurs, de près de mille commiteurs, et de plus de cent entreprises.
Plusieurs business models sont possibles autour des projets Eclipse, des modèles de service pur, jusqu'aux modèles d'éditeur. Alors que la fondation Eclipse a été historiquement menée par des fournisseurs de technologies au premier rang desquels IBM, de nouvelles initiatives comme OPEES voient le jour pour donner la part belle aux industriels qui sont des utilisateurs avertis des technologies Eclipse.
Gaël Blondelle, leader du Toulouse JUG et co-organisateur de la journée introduira et animera cette table ronde avec l'intervention de Benjamin Cabé, Simon Chemouil, Pierre Gaufillet.
Gaël Blondelle est Business Developer Open Source pour Obeo, et s'occupe plus particulièrement de projet OPEES de structuration d'un écosystème Open Source autour des outils de développement pour les systèmes embarqués critiques.
Gaël est aussi JUG leader du Toulouse JUG. Il a commencé à travailler dans un contexte Open Source en 2004, et a en particulier été chairman du Technology Council du consortium OW2 de 2007 à 2010.

Clojure et Eclipse RCP, par Gaétan Morice
Clojure est un langage fonctionnel et dynamique destiné à la JVM. Comme d'autres langages alternatifs à Java (Scala, JRuby, Groovy, Java Script et d'autres), il suscite de plus en plus d'intérêt. Il se distingue cependant
par une combinaison unique de caractéristiques:
Clojure est construit sur un ensemble de concepts: temps, état, référence, qui s'articulent de manière cohérente et guide le développement de solutions.
Clojure est un dialecte de LISP, il propose à l'utilisateur un développement extrêmement dynamique ainsi qu'un système de macro particulièrement efficace.
Enfin, Clojure bénéficie d'une très bonne intégration dans la JVM, offrant une interaction native avec le code Java et la compilation du source en bytecode.
L'ensemble de ces qualités permettent à Clojure de proposer des solutions à la fois élégantes et pratique à des problèmes complexes tels que la programmation multi-threadée. Cette présentation sera dans sa première partie consacrée à l'introduction du langage et des notions associées. Dans un deuxième temps, elle abordera l'utilisation qui peut en être fait dans le développement d'une application RCP.
Gaétan Morice dirige l'équipe de R&D dédiée à l'outillage pour le
développement embarqué chez Sierra Wireless. Cette équipe réalise, depuis
plusieurs années, des produits basés sur Eclipse RCP et mettant en œuvre
de nombreuses technologies Eclipse et OSGi (EMF, GMF, Xpand, CDT, DLTK, Š)

Génération d'applications JavaEE avec EEF et Acceleo, par Frédéric Madiot
Avec Acceleo, intégré dans Eclipse/Modeling depuis plus de deux ans, il est déjà possible de créer des générateurs de code pour produire des applications JavaEE. Acceleo exploite alors des modèles EMF qui sont généralement créés avec des modeleurs graphiques basés sur GMF. Avec EEF (Extended Editing Framework), il est désormais très facile d'utiliser également RCP pour éditer un modèle EMF. Cette présentation illustrera l'utilisation de EEF pour modéliser les données, les services et la cinématique d'une application et générer du code vers des frameworks JavaEE tels que Spring et Hibernate.
Frédéric Madiot est Responsable Produits à Obeo. Il travaille depuis plus de quinze ans dans le développement d'outils pour industrialiser le développement d'applications et la modernisation d'applications existantes grâce aux technologies modeling. Il participe depuis quatre ans au développement de composants pour le projet Eclipse/Modeling.

SWTBot, par Mariot Chauvin
SWTBot est un outil de tests fonctionnels pour SWT et les applications basées sur Eclipse qui permet de tester facilement des applications multithreadées.
Avec l'augmentation du nombre d'applications complexes reposant sur la plateforme Eclipse, le test manuel de ces applications devient une préoccupation majeure dans le cycle de développement. Le besoin d'automatiser en partie ces tests devient inévitable et l'utilisation d'un tel outil peut aider grandement.
Dans cette présentation j'exposerai les fonctionnalités de SWTBot en donnant des conseils, notamment sur l'écriture de tests maintenables. Je montrerai comment cet outil peut vous aider à être plus agile en sortant fréquemment de nouvelles versions tout en étant confiant sur leur qualité et leur bon fonctionnement.
