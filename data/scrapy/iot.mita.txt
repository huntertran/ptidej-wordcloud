Project:
Eclipse Mita
Release:
0.1.0
Description:
This is the initial release of Eclipse Mita. Mita is a new programming language for IoT devices that targets developers who are new to embedded software development, specifically those who come from a cloud background. As a developer Mita feels like a modern programming language (in the vein of TypeScript), but translates to C code which compiles to native code running directly on the embedded hardware. Combining declarative configuration and powerful language features with code generation enables projects to scale their deployment over quantity - from the first prototype to shipping thousands of devices.
This release serves as a foundation for the future. With a big upcoming change, a complete rewrite of the typesystem, this is the last stable point for a while.
However Mita right now is pretty matured: there is a huge platform implemented, the XDK 110, as well as two smaller platforms that serve as a starting point for platform integrators.
For this purpose different documentation exists, such as a contribution guide and a platform integrators guide to help newcomers.
All the while this is a preview version and far from a 1.0 release, pertaining to the upcoming type system overhaul, improvements to the event system and a way to configure a more detailed life cycle for components.
Architectural Issues:
Architecturewise this release is the foundation for upcoming releases. As such there are some unpaid technical depts from when the project started. One of these is Statechart Tool's event system, which, while quite correct, is not feature complete enough for our purposes and language needs.
Furthermore there are some unimplemented features:
The event system is quite simple for now, however an improved draft exists
The lifecycle of components is as simple as possible: they all start and end with the device itself
There's a limit to how deep generated types (like arrays) can be nested. This is due to a limitation in the current API design.
Security Issues:
There are no known security issues at the time of writing.
Non-Code Aspects:
Eclipse Mita has the following guides and resources available:
An
extensive documentation
on the core language and platforms
A
Getting Started guide
for developers on how to contribute
A Platform Integrators guide (TBD soon) to help with extending Mita with new platforms
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
Not verified
Usability Details:
Our language editors are based on Xtext which provides syntax highlighting and well implemented support for auto complete, validation and so on.
End of Life:
Since this is the first release of Mita there are no deprecated or removed features.
Standards:
Not applicable
Communities:
Since the start of the project we have had increasing interest and interaction with end users in the form of bug reports and feature requests and some external contributions by pull requests.
We have an implementation for communicating with Eclipse Hono.
Bosch Connected Devices and Solutions has shipped Mita in three iterations of its XDK Workbench for their freely programmable IoT device "Cross Domain Development Kit" (XDK) so far and continues to support and use it.

Scope:
Eclipse Mita aims to build a new programming language for the embedded IoT including editor/IDE, compiler and an extensive test-suite. Mita inherits the syntax of modern general-purpose system-level languages (e.g. Swift or Rust), but compiles to near-production ready C code. It offers powerful abstractions for sensor access, connectivity and general purpose IO. Centered around developer experience, it is build as a DSL using Eclipse Xtext.
