Scope:
Eclipse Yasham is a highly modular cloud native platform that interconnects a wide range of consumer IoT & smart home services via extensible cloud software adapters to abstract away the specific communication protocols & requirements of cloud based services by a simplified and generic integration model towards the Eclipse Yasham consumer IoT platform. The scope of the platform is mainly about the topics: Consumer IoT, Smart Home, Smart Building and Smart Living. The flexible and modular architecture of Eclipse Yasham will allow the usage of the platform in a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) or commercial Business-to-Business (B2B) deployment scenario
