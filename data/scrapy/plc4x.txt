Users
This part of the PLC4X website is dedicated to people wanting to use Apache PLC4X.
It will provide information on the features and how to use them as well as documentation on how to use the different integration modules.
Apache PLC4X allows you to communicate directly with your industrial Hardware, without having to retrofit it.
This is possible, as PLC4X implements drivers for the most common industrial communication protocols and uses these to access industrial hardware using a shared API.
Currently we support the following protocols:
AB-ETH
ADS/AMS
BACnet/IP
CANopen
DeltaV
DF1
EtherNet/IP
Firmata
KNXnet/IP
Modbus
OPC UA
S7 (Step7)

Besides providing access to devices using one of above protocols, Apache PLC4X also ships with integration modules for the following tools and frameworks.
Apache Calcite™
Apache Camel™
Apache Edgent™ (retired)
Apache IoTDB™
Apache Kafka™
Apache Nifi™
Apache StreamPipes™ (incubating)
Eclipse Ditto

As last category of tools come modules that can be used in your applications:
Connection Pool (Connection Pool for PLC connections)
Object PLC Mapping (OPM) (Object PLC Mapping - Like JPA for PLC data)
Scraper (Util for automating fetching PLC data using a variety of triggers)
Testing-Utils (Want to build/test an application without having a PLC …​ this is the tool for you)

Apache
The universal
protocol adapter for
Industrial IoT
PLC4X is a set of libraries
for
communicating with
industrial
programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.
Get started
Connect your shopfloor assets without retrofit.
In contrast to other approaches, Apache PLC4X lets you connect your
industrial assets without needing to modify them.
Integrations.
PLC4X comes with many built-in integrations to further process your asset data.

Secure by design.
Not only are PLC4X drivers implemented with security in mind, also our passive-mode drivers bring to you guaranteed side-effect-freeness without the need to pay for validated software.
Get the performance you need.
Most approaches like OPC-UA currently don't deliver the performance needed for machine learning, deep learning and AI. PLC4X allows you to get the data volumes in the resolutions needed, without stressing out your industrial hardware.
No license costs, no restrictive licenses.
Being open source, PLC4X is free of charge. Start experimenting
without worrying about license costs or shady license agreements. The Apache 2.0 is one of the worlds most trusted and adopted open source licenses out there.
Get the commercial support you need.
Just because you can download and use PLC4X for free doesn't mean that you're left on your own. Some of our community member's companies can also provide you with the commercial support you need.
