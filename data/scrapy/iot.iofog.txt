Eclipse ioFog is a complete edge computing platform that provides all of the pieces needed to build and run applications at the edge at enterprise scale. The diversity and complexity of edge hardware is abstracted by ioFog Agent software. The management and orchestration of edge microservices is performed by ioFog Controller and its supporting set of components.

Eclipse Kuksa
Internet of Things
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

Updates to the Tutorial flow to support new Demo
Project Wide Work
Ported all CI to Azure Pipelines
Simplified Packaging, Tagging and Release process for public artifacts
Implemented initial cross component integration tests suite in Test Runner repo
Added support for pushing snapshot/rc artifacts to PackageCloud
Integrated Snyk for continual security and vulnerability analysis
Cleaned up, refactored and retired old/crufty repos, branches and code we no longer needed
API Certification:
The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".
Architectural Issues:
We paid down a ton of legacy tech debt in this release, removing a slew of old repos, and defunct branches from the repos we wanted to keep. Additionally, we aligned all compoents to build from a new set of baseline docker images. Additionally, we reimplemented CI on top of Azure pipelines to give us true CI, not just periodic builds (which had been the case on Travis).
For this release we have submitted all outstanding CQs and removed libs that were questionable from a license stand point.
Lastly, a new Test Runner repo contains a full stack integration test suite (or at least the initial version of it) that will test a fully deployed system post CI snapshot builds.
Security Issues:
We have integrated Snyk as a tool into our build pipeline to immediately alert on security issues.
Non-Code Aspects:
New release artifacts are available on PackageCloud. Single one line install for most components. We have upgrade documentation at iofog.org and simplified the Demo and tutorial flow and experience for a completely new ioFog user.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:

metamodel browser, trace view
project builders, launch configurations
deployment facilities and Ant support
Java API for executing QVT transformations programmatically, support for the standalone execution of transformations

The addition of iofogctl as a unified CLI drove us to expose further management and monitoring APIs via REST, so the entire platform is now configurabler and manageable via REST.
Security Issues:
Inceased identity verification between ioFog Connector and ioFog Controller to allow for widely distributed deployments to operate more securely.
Non-Code Aspects:
We have added further documentation tutorials that include
ioFog platform deployment to kubernetes
Installing ioFog via HELM to Kubernetes
iofogctl command line tool and management/deployment of ioFog
Updated all of the demo/tutorial documentation
Improved the API documentation
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
