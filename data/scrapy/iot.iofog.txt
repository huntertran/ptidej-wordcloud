Eclipse ioFog is a complete edge computing platform that provides all of the pieces needed to build and run applications at the edge at enterprise scale. The diversity and complexity of edge hardware is abstracted by ioFog Agent software. The management and orchestration of edge microservices is performed by ioFog Controller and its supporting set of components.

State:
Successful
End Date of the Review Period:
Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.
Wednesday, June 19, 2019
Project:
Eclipse ioFog
Release:
1.1.0
Description:
Agent (v1.0.14)
Features
Added support for setting and passing through environment variables in docker containers at runtime (see iofog-agent CLI)
Added support for overriding container CMD directives at runtime (see iofog-agent cli)
Agent Docker images now build from iofog-docker-images for stability
Bugs
Fix for deleting local images when registry was set to local
Fix for when multiple Agents would removes other Agent's microservices on the same node
Fixed for Private registries authentication
Stop running microservices when iofog-agent package gets uninstalled (for real time this!)
Controller
(v1.0.38)
Features
Added support for setting and passing through environment variables in docker containers at runtime (see iofog-controller CLI)
Added support for overriding container CMD directives at runtime (see iofog-controller CLI)
Added capability to return a microservice's public url when a public port is set
New metrics being tracked:
Total CPU usage
Available disk
Available memory
Controller Docker images now build from iofog-docker-images for stability
Bugs
Update microservice did always get picked up by Agent
High CPU usage when Controller was running for couple of weeks
Fixed log rotation (should work infinitely now)
Fixed regression where Ports public directive was not honored
Connector (v1.0.4)
Features
Connector Docker images now build from iofog-docker-images for stability
Bugs
Improved and now return correct HTTP status codes when API call fails
Demo
Features
Huge refactoring and consolidation of Demo repo
Rather than distinct environments, Demo now builds from a single docker-compose environment which is then augmented/decorated
Updated and refactored docker-compose configurations to support V3 api spec
Optimized Dockerfiles
Improved overall user experience, logging and demo output
Re-worked tutorial workflow to simplify user experience
All Docker images now build from iofog-base-images for stability
Added support for integration testing using TestHarness during CI execution
Bug Fixes
Fixed Agent docker depending on unstable location of Java
iofog.org
Features
Added documentation to support new Environment variables for Docker Containers
Added documentation to support new CMD override for Docker Containers
Updates to the Tutorial flow to support new Demo
Project Wide Work
Ported all CI to Azure Pipelines
Simplified Packaging, Tagging and Release process for public artifacts
Implemented initial cross component integration tests suite in Test Runner repo
Added support for pushing snapshot/rc artifacts to PackageCloud
Integrated Snyk for continual security and vulnerability analysis
Cleaned up, refactored and retired old/crufty repos, branches and code we no longer needed
API Certification:
The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".
Architectural Issues:
We paid down a ton of legacy tech debt in this release, removing a slew of old repos, and defunct branches from the repos we wanted to keep. Additionally, we aligned all compoents to build from a new set of baseline docker images. Additionally, we reimplemented CI on top of Azure pipelines to give us true CI, not just periodic builds (which had been the case on Travis).
For this release we have submitted all outstanding CQs and removed libs that were questionable from a license stand point.
Lastly, a new Test Runner repo contains a full stack integration test suite (or at least the initial version of it) that will test a fully deployed system post CI snapshot builds.
Security Issues:
We have integrated Snyk as a tool into our build pipeline to immediately alert on security issues.
Non-Code Aspects:
New release artifacts are available on PackageCloud. Single one line install for most components. We have upgrade documentation at iofog.org and simplified the Demo and tutorial flow and experience for a completely new ioFog user.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
Not verified
Communities:
We have added new committers to the project, and actively supported all users on the ioFog Discuss forums.

Scope:
1. A software agent, called ioFog Agent, that provides a universal environment for edge computing microservices
2. A distributable control plane, called ioFog Controller, that provides remote control and management of ioFog Agent instances
3. A software overlay network component, called ioFog Connector, that provides secure connectivity between any edge microservices managed by ioFog
4. Deployment and management software and tooling that makes it easier to manage ioFog systems at scale
5. SDKs in multiple programming languages, allowing developers to program edge applications and micro-services

Review Information
1.3.0 brings new quality of life improvements as well as a set of backend changes that extend and unify ioFog's capabilities.
ioFog Kubernetes support has been improved by expanding the ioFog Kubernetes Operator's capabilities. Now orchestration of ioFog Kubernetes is handled by the Operator. Previously, Helm and iofogctl were handling this orchestration themselves, in disparate ways.
ioFog Controller has been updated to allow for external databases to be used instead of the embedded SQLite default database. Helm and iofogctl have been updated to allow users to integrate their external databases during the deployment process.
The unified CLI, iofogctl, has been improved to allow users more granular control over resources like Connectors and Microservices. Users can now view realtime deployment status of Microservices through iofogctl due to improvements to both ioFog Controller and Agent.
The iofog-go-sdk has been updated to provide an HTTP client for ioFog Controller's REST API.
