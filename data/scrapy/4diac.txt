Besides these FB types also two grouping elements are provided. The grouping elements are adapters and subapplications. Adapters allow the grouping of interface elements within an own adapter type to reduce the amount of connections. Subapplications allow the grouping of FBs and therefore build FBNs. 4diac's FB library currently contains BFBs, CFBs, SIFBs and adapters which can be divided into the following subgroups.

Standard Compliant Representation of Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED)
In order to test the standard-based implementation of IEDs in Smart Grid applications based on the IEC 61850 and IEC 61499 standard a suitable validation method is necessary. The real-time simulation method - especially Controller-Hardware-in-the-Loop CHIL experiments - seems to be a very promising approach. The main reason for using CHIL in this work is the fact that the control application is executed on the real controller hard- and software environment (e.g. one or more embedded IED controllers). With this approach, the control application can be tested in a more realistic use case scenario - compared to pure software simulation - during its development together with a simulated power network. The implemented CHIL framework on basis of the IEC 61499 solution is provided in the following figure.

Eclipse 4diac at Open Platform Automation Forum 2020 in Shanghai
2020-10-06
Age: 19 days
On 15th September, the open platform automation forum was held at
Shanghai Automation Fair 2020
. The open platform automation forum aimed at promoting open technologies such as IEC 61499 and OPC UA for industrial automation. Mr. Yao from Changzhou MaximLumen Ltd presented a Eclipse 4diac-based IEC 61499 solution for distributed control applications. Based on the 4diac IDE and 4diac FORTE runtime, they created a customized IEC 61499 runtime TinyForte that could be fit in small embedded devices. The IEC 61499 standard provides great support for innovation from medium and small industrial vendors.

Eclipse 4diac 1.13 - Sneak Preview #2
2020-09-03
Age: 52 days
Dear 4diac Users!
The next release of 4diac IDE comes with several major features to improve the support for Structured Datatypes. To be able to easily create and edit structured data types, we decided to introduce the new data type editor. Have a look at it here:
With a table layout and direct editing, it is almost self-explanatory and - hopefully - very easy to use. Although we know that a detailed view like a table has the disadvantage of being somewhat confusing, especially with numerous data types, we decided to go for it and tackle this problem head on. The solution we came up with is a new dropdown field:
It is a search field with content proposal and the possibility to open a selection dialog, enabling you to filter through thousands of data types without breaking a sweat.
Cheers,
Daniel Lindhuber

Final report on OCL 4 4diac Google Summer of Code 2020 Project
2020-08-31
Age: 55 days
Hi!
Here is the last update on my GSoC project. With this last update, I would like to give you an overview of everything that has been done and everything I learned during my
GSoC project
.
Before starting the project, I got myself familiar with the IEC 61499 standard and the Ecore models of the 4diac IDE. My first steps in the Eclipse 4diac IDE were to create OCL constraints and intergrate them into the IDE. Starting from simple checks at the ECC level to creating more complex contraints at the Application level. Altogether, 16 constraints have been created:
ECC:
SelfCycleMustBeGatedByEvent, TransitionLowerThanOne, TransitionHigherThanOne, UnreachableState, TerminalState, DeadState, UnusedEventInput, UnusedEventOutput, NoneTransitionWithoutCondition, GuardOnlyCycle
Application:
UnreachableFB, DataInputMustHaveValue, FBCommentFieldMustHaveValue, TimeFormat, BoolFormat, AssociatedDataMustBeConfigured
At the beginning of the project, I implemented a simple dialog window for displaying the results of the violated constraints. It was a preliminary prototype only for testing purposes. Later, we decided to improve the UI and use the Problems tab of Eclipse. The current implementation has several cool features:
Displaying description, resource, path, location and severity(Error, Warning, Info) of the problem
Better Error Marker support: When the user double clicks on one of the lines in the Problems View, the framework automatically selects the corresponding model element on which the constraint is violated (at the ECC level).
The automatic invocation of the OCL validation: When the user saves the currently edited model, the validation is automatically invoked.
Eclipse Community Forums: 4DIAC - Framework for Distributed Industrial Automation and Control
Eclipse 4diac Documentation
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to implement constraints on the Xtext side. Even though the project is finished with this month, I want to keep working with the Eclipse 4diac team. I would like to get familiar with the 4diac Xtext implementation and check whether it would be advantageous to use well-formedness rules there.
Finally, I would like to summarize my experience with GSoC and the 4diac team. I learned a lot during the summer, it was a very nice experience to get to know the IEC 61499 standard and infrastructure of the 4diac IDE. But the most important thing was to get to know an open and kind community, that helped me with every problem and question I had. Even though we could only communicate online, I had a great time working on this project and I want to thank Alois, Bianca, and Martin for the assistance and help throughout the project.
Cheers,
Sándor
Eclipse 4diac 1.13 - Sneak Preview #1
2020-08-26
Age: 60 days
Dear 4diac Users!
Our next release (1.13) is scheduled for October. As a sneak preview, please have a look at our redesigned ECC. To make working with 4diac IDE (even) more fun, we have been modernizing the appearance of your models.
With the new transparent background of transition labels, a more compact design of ECCs is feasible. We hope that you also like our new color scheme where output events are shown in red - like the event interface pins.
Cheers,
Bianca Wiesmayr

Hey All!
Here is a new update on my GSoC project. I am excited to announce that I have finished the implementation of the first set of OCL constraints. It is now possible to give 4diac users early feedback on the validation errors at the ECC level and at the Application level. The list of constraints can be found
here
. The validation messages (error, warnings and infos) are displayed in the Problems View (see screenshot below). The last step of this project is to complete the implementation of the remaining constraints and improve the infrastructure around OCL. As always feedback and support are warmly welcome.

Eclipse 4diac Welcomes Google Summer of Code 2020 Student
2020-06-02
Age: 145 days
The Eclipse 4diac team is excited to announce that this year we again get the chance to work with a student in the
Google Summer of Code program
:
Sándor Bácsi
will be working on setting up an infrastructure for checking the correctness of IEC 61499 models using
Object Constraint Language (OCL)
. OCL can be a solution to find issues in IEC 61499 models since it provides capabilities for specifying generic constraints a model has to fulfill. We hope that the work of Sándor will give our users early feedback and with that improve the usability and user experience of 4diac IDE.

The main usability improvement in 1.12.0 is the
in-place instance creation
. This allows searching for FBs in the library quickly and inserting them. Try the feature: the window opens immediately when you double-click on the background of the Application editor.

navigation through large applications
. With CTRL+arrow keys you may now navigate through your Application. Additionally, the Page up/down key is now handled correctly. To improve horizontal scrolling, we offer Alt+Page Up/down. Did you know that drag and drop with the middle mouse button can be used to navigate through the application?
After viewing the contents of a subapplication, one commonly needs to jump back to the application. For this use case, we implemented “Go to parent”, accessible via the context menu.
Working with subapplications is now more convenient. An untyped subapplication can be saved as Type via the context menu. Additionally, you may want to include variations to a Type. For this use case, we implemented the “Detach from subapplication Type”-feature, which converts a type to an untyped subapplication.
Many usability improvements:
Bypass FB
Follow Connection
Reorganized context menu: The context menu was shortened and grouped logically.
Follow Connection
The positioning of elements was greatly improved. Previously, scrolling and zooming was often handled incorrectly. Creating a new subapp from existing FBs will now correctly place them in the top-left corner of the subapp. Additionally, undo/redo of subapp creation correctly inserts the blocks at their previous position.
The performance of loading and saving system configurations was improved so that 4diac IDE can now handle larger systems much better.

Eclipse 4diac 1.13 - Sneak Preview #2
2020-09-03
Age: 52 days
Dear 4diac Users!
The next release of 4diac IDE comes with several major features to improve the support for Structured Datatypes. To be able to easily create and edit structured data types, we decided to introduce the new data type editor. Have a look at it here:
With a table layout and direct editing, it is almost self-explanatory and - hopefully - very easy to use. Although we know that a detailed view like a table has the disadvantage of being somewhat confusing, especially with numerous data types, we decided to go for it and tackle this problem head on. The solution we came up with is a new dropdown field:
It is a search field with content proposal and the possibility to open a selection dialog, enabling you to filter through thousands of data types without breaking a sweat.
Cheers,
Daniel Lindhuber

Eclipse 4diac Welcomes a New Committer
2020-03-18
Age: 221 days
Hi!
During the past year, 4diac IDE has kept me increasingly busy in my work and private life. I got to know the 4diac community - especially during the last 4days of 4diac - and the development process.
My main focus is currently on improving the usability of the IDE. This greatly improves the learnability of the tool, while also increasing the development speed of experienced developers. Furthermore, I am involved in teaching IEC 61499 and Eclipse 4diac at university.
Today, I am excited and honored to announce that I got promoted to committer status. In addition to my own developments, I will now increasingly review code submitted by other contributors.

Hi!
Here is the last update on my GSoC project. With this last update, I would like to give you an overview of everything that has been done and everything I learned during my
GSoC project
.
Before starting the project, I got myself familiar with the IEC 61499 standard and the Ecore models of the 4diac IDE. My first steps in the Eclipse 4diac IDE were to create OCL constraints and intergrate them into the IDE. Starting from simple checks at the ECC level to creating more complex contraints at the Application level. Altogether, 16 constraints have been created:
ECC:
SelfCycleMustBeGatedByEvent, TransitionLowerThanOne, TransitionHigherThanOne, UnreachableState, TerminalState, DeadState, UnusedEventInput, UnusedEventOutput, NoneTransitionWithoutCondition, GuardOnlyCycle
Application:
UnreachableFB, DataInputMustHaveValue, FBCommentFieldMustHaveValue, TimeFormat, BoolFormat, AssociatedDataMustBeConfigured
At the beginning of the project, I implemented a simple dialog window for displaying the results of the violated constraints. It was a preliminary prototype only for testing purposes. Later, we decided to improve the UI and use the Problems tab of Eclipse. The current implementation has several cool features:
Displaying description, resource, path, location and severity(Error, Warning, Info) of the problem
Better Error Marker support: When the user double clicks on one of the lines in the Problems View, the framework automatically selects the corresponding model element on which the constraint is violated (at the ECC level).
The automatic invocation of the OCL validation: When the user saves the currently edited model, the validation is automatically invoked.
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to implement constraints on the Xtext side. Even though the project is finished with this month, I want to keep working with the Eclipse 4diac team. I would like to get familiar with the 4diac Xtext implementation and check whether it would be advantageous to use well-formedness rules there.
Finally, I would like to summarize my experience with GSoC and the 4diac team. I learned a lot during the summer, it was a very nice experience to get to know the IEC 61499 standard and infrastructure of the 4diac IDE. But the most important thing was to get to know an open and kind community, that helped me with every problem and question I had. Even though we could only communicate online, I had a great time working on this project and I want to thank Alois, Bianca, and Martin for the assistance and help throughout the project.

Eclipse 4diac 1.13 - Sneak Preview #1
2020-08-26
Age: 60 days
Dear 4diac Users!
Our next release (1.13) is scheduled for October. As a sneak preview, please have a look at our redesigned ECC. To make working with 4diac IDE (even) more fun, we have been modernizing the appearance of your models.
With the new transparent background of transition labels, a more compact design of ECCs is feasible. We hope that you also like our new color scheme where output events are shown in red - like the event interface pins.
Cheers,
Bianca Wiesmayr

In-place Instance Creation
2019-12-16
Age: 314 days
This is the second of a series of posts on bigger 4diac IDE UI changes originated in the recent usability studies and discussions at the 4days of 4diac summit (
first post
).
While the type palette shown on the right side of our editors has the great the advantage that it is easily explore-able by new users. Also creating instances by drag and drop is a very common concept used in many tools. However when more and more types are added the palette navigation gets harder. Also the drag and drop creation leads to lots of mouse movements and gets tedious. Therefore we want to propose a new in-place type creation as shown in the following mock-up image:
The behavior is proposed as follows:
An double click the text field with the button to the right is shown

This drop down list shows the type name maybe with type icon and followed by a dash the path and file name in italic and some lighter color (e.g., slightly grayish)
When the user types something in the text field the drop down list is updated with types matching the search text
Selecting a type from the list with arrows + enter or with a double click will create an instance of that type
Clicking on the button right to the text field brings up the insert FB pop-up menu so that the user can easily explore the type library
Furthermore we see the following extensions:
<Ctrl + Left Click> bring up the insert type pop-up menu
If the text entered into the text box does not much a type create an untyped subapp with the given name. Not sure if this is a good idea.
When the user starts typing and the mouse has not been moved beyond a certain threshold from the last left click position also bring up the type creation editor.
A key question for us is if this concept can replace the type palette of the FB Network editor?
Please use
Bug 558338
for feedback.

Sándor Bácsi
will be working on setting up an infrastructure for checking the correctness of IEC 61499 models using
Object Constraint Language (OCL)
. OCL can be a solution to find issues in IEC 61499 models since it provides capabilities for specifying generic constraints a model has to fulfill. We hope that the work of Sándor will give our users early feedback and with that improve the usability and user experience of 4diac IDE.
Details on the plan work, the milestones, and ideas what Sándor wants to check can be found on the
project's wiki page
. As always feedback and support is warmly welcome.
We are looking forward to work together with Sándor on this interesting problem over this summer.
Cheers,
The 4diac Team

This is a start of a series of posts on bigger 4diac IDE UI changes originated in the recent usability studies and discussions at the 4days of 4diac summit.
When we started 4diac IDE we decided to treat an Eclipse project equally to an IEC 61499 system. This had several advantages (e.g., simple project tree, alignment of type lib to projects). However in the usability evaluations done over the last year we got the feedback that this design has several shortcomings. Therefore we want to propose to change the naming and presentation of projects and system such that one Eclipse project (i.e., a 4diac project) can have several systems, as shown in the mock-up picture below. Furthermore, the type library files and folders would be moved to a dedicated type-library folder.
This proposal has several advantages:
Unambiguous reuse of all project related Eclipse Platform features (e.g., import existing project into workspace)
Several systems can share a common type library
Basis for more advanced type-library concepts (e.g., linked read only elements)
Better representation of none IEC 61499 files (e.g., documentation, virtual dns file, 4diac FORTE C++ source code)
Simplification of some 4diac IDE code
Can be the basis for some other usability improvements (see later posts)
So far we have identified the following required changes:
System explorer needs to show files on root level, sort IEC 61499 system files to top followed by the type-library folder
New 4diac Project Wizard creates: project, default system, default application, and the type-library in dedicated Type Library folder
design once use everywhere

4diac 1.12.0 Released!
2020-04-10
Age: 198 days
We are very proud to announce the 4diac 1.12.0 release!
Apart from many bug fixes and improvements, we also modernized the design of Applications and the System Configuration. We could address 108 issues in the work for the new 4diac version. The main changes and new features in 4diac 1.12.0 are:
4diac IDE:
The main usability improvement in 1.12.0 is the
in-place instance creation
. This allows searching for FBs in the library quickly and inserting them. Try the feature: the window opens immediately when you double-click on the background of the Application editor.
We implemented key codes to improve your
navigation through large applications
. With CTRL+arrow keys you may now navigate through your Application. Additionally, the Page up/down key is now handled correctly. To improve horizontal scrolling, we offer Alt+Page Up/down. Did you know that drag and drop with the middle mouse button can be used to navigate through the application?
After viewing the contents of a subapplication, one commonly needs to jump back to the application. For this use case, we implemented “Go to parent”, accessible via the context menu.
Working with subapplications is now more convenient. An untyped subapplication can be saved as Type via the context menu. Additionally, you may want to include variations to a Type. For this use case, we implemented the “Detach from subapplication Type”-feature, which converts a type to an untyped subapplication.
Many usability improvements:

Follow Connection
Reorganized context menu: The context menu was shortened and grouped logically.
Follow Connection
The positioning of elements was greatly improved. Previously, scrolling and zooming was often handled incorrectly. Creating a new subapp from existing FBs will now correctly place them in the top-left corner of the subapp. Additionally, undo/redo of subapp creation correctly inserts the blocks at their previous position.
The performance of loading and saving system configurations was improved so that 4diac IDE can now handle larger systems much better.
4diac FORTE:
Bit-wise access of ANY_BIT data types (e.g., myWord.%X3)
Fixed memory leak in Lua integration when using variables of type STRING and WSTRING
Fixed several build issues with CMake
Fixed boolean IOs on Wago PLCs
Improved Arrowhead support

HTTP and OPC UA on Raspberry Pi
The same application can run on different devices such as a Raspberry Pi, a PLC or your computer, since the application is independent of the device on which it's running.
Note that you can run this application not only in one device, but you can distribute it to many devices, as shown in the picture below.
This application might not be intended for only one device, but for a whole system with many devices. In that case, some FBs will need to run on one device, and some on others - a distributed system is created. With 4diac IDE you can design your distributed application and deploy it.

Eclipse 4diac Welcomes a New Committer
2020-03-18
Age: 221 days
Hi!
During the past year, 4diac IDE has kept me increasingly busy in my work and private life. I got to know the 4diac community - especially during the last 4days of 4diac - and the development process.
My main focus is currently on improving the usability of the IDE. This greatly improves the learnability of the tool, while also increasing the development speed of experienced developers. Furthermore, I am involved in teaching IEC 61499 and Eclipse 4diac at university.
Today, I am excited and honored to announce that I got promoted to committer status. In addition to my own developments, I will now increasingly review code submitted by other contributors.
Cheers,
Bianca Wiesmayr

In-place Instance Creation
2019-12-16
Age: 314 days
This is the second of a series of posts on bigger 4diac IDE UI changes originated in the recent usability studies and discussions at the 4days of 4diac summit (
first post
).
While the type palette shown on the right side of our editors has the great the advantage that it is easily explore-able by new users. Also creating instances by drag and drop is a very common concept used in many tools. However when more and more types are added the palette navigation gets harder. Also the drag and drop creation leads to lots of mouse movements and gets tedious. Therefore we want to propose a new in-place type creation as shown in the following mock-up image:
The behavior is proposed as follows:
An double click the text field with the button to the right is shown
Also initially a drop down list with the last 3 - 5 used types is shown
This drop down list shows the type name maybe with type icon and followed by a dash the path and file name in italic and some lighter color (e.g., slightly grayish)
When the user types something in the text field the drop down list is updated with types matching the search text

FORTE and uC-OS (open-source now)?
By:
Lik Lik
on
to get familiar with the 4diac IDE. FORTE uses the
open62541
OPC UA stack which is open source and can also be used in commercial projects free of charge.
After version 1.11.0 of 4diac, the OPC UA module has changed its API, so applications developed before this version won't be compatible. The changes give more stability to 4diac FORTE and also brings new features. The OPC UA module can be used with v1.0 of open62541.
Tasks in this tutorial:
Build FORTE with open62541
Provide OPC UA variables to clients
Offer an OPC UA method to be called by clients
Call a remote method from a IEC 61499 Application
Create an OPC UA subscription in an IEC 61499 Application
Build FORTE with open62541
OPC UA is not enabled by default in FORTE. To enable it, you need to build FORTE with the open62541 source code yourself.
Attention
: You need
python
installed on your computer in order to compile the OPCUA library.

Quick Intro
4diac IDE is an open source IDE intended for distributed industrial systems. It is also applicable in other areas such as home automation, electrical networks, or wherever you think some automated system is needed. You can "program" an application using Function Blocks and your program will look like the one in image below.
The same application can run on different devices such as a Raspberry Pi, a PLC or your computer, since the application is independent of the device on which it's running.
Note that you can run this application not only in one device, but you can distribute it to many devices, as shown in the picture below.
This application might not be intended for only one device, but for a whole system with many devices. In that case, some FBs will need to run on one device, and some on others - a distributed system is created. With 4diac IDE you can design your distributed application and deploy it.

Selecting a type from the list with arrows + enter or with a double click will create an instance of that type
Clicking on the button right to the text field brings up the insert FB pop-up menu so that the user can easily explore the type library
Furthermore we see the following extensions:
<Ctrl + Left Click> bring up the insert type pop-up menu
If the text entered into the text box does not much a type create an untyped subapp with the given name. Not sure if this is a good idea.
When the user starts typing and the mouse has not been moved beyond a certain threshold from the last left click position also bring up the type creation editor.
A key question for us is if this concept can replace the type palette of the FB Network editor?

Proposed New Project Layout
2019-12-15
Age: 315 days
This is a start of a series of posts on bigger 4diac IDE UI changes originated in the recent usability studies and discussions at the 4days of 4diac summit.
When we started 4diac IDE we decided to treat an Eclipse project equally to an IEC 61499 system. This had several advantages (e.g., simple project tree, alignment of type lib to projects). However in the usability evaluations done over the last year we got the feedback that this design has several shortcomings. Therefore we want to propose to change the naming and presentation of projects and system such that one Eclipse project (i.e., a 4diac project) can have several systems, as shown in the mock-up picture below. Furthermore, the type library files and folders would be moved to a dedicated type-library folder.
This proposal has several advantages:

Unambiguous reuse of all project related Eclipse Platform features (e.g., import existing project into workspace)
Several systems can share a common type library
Basis for more advanced type-library concepts (e.g., linked read only elements)
Better representation of none IEC 61499 files (e.g., documentation, virtual dns file, 4diac FORTE C++ source code)
Simplification of some 4diac IDE code
Can be the basis for some other usability improvements (see later posts)
So far we have identified the following required changes:
System explorer needs to show files on root level, sort IEC 61499 system files to top followed by the type-library folder
New 4diac Project Wizard creates: project, default system, default application, and the type-library in dedicated Type Library folder
New System Wizard needs a selection list for 4diac Projects (similar how it is now done in the New Application Wizard)
New Application Wizard the systems in the selection list need to be grouped into projects
We know that this is quite a big change therefore we are actively asking for your feedback. Weâ€™ve created the
Bug 558338
in our Bugzilla for collecting and discussing feedback.
Looking forward for your comments and ideas!

Improved OPC UA support for 4diac
2019-09-02
Age: 419 days
After some months of working, the improved OPC UA module for 4diac is now finally merged in the developed branch.
Why change the OPC UA Module?
After working with OPC UA and real cases with different companies using different OPC UA stacks, we realized that the OPC UA module in FORTE wasn't reliable and often crashed, and wasn't easy to extend. Also, we noticed that other companies had the same problem. So we decided to make a deep clean-up of the OPC UA module and add the capabilities we found were needed.
So... what's new?
The changes were done in the FORTE code, and the main things include:
Client and server are completely separated. Using just clients capabilities won't start the server.
When using the client, if the connection is lost, FORTE will reconnect.
You can now look for nodes in remote server using not only the browsename, but also the Node ID.

You can set a desired Node ID (and name) for the variables you create in your local server. (Numeric, String and Bytestring).
You can easily integrate your own nodesets to FORTE's compilation.
You can easily add your own types.
Support of v0.3.0 and v1.0 versions of open62541.
But, how good is it actually?
Before, each Function Block has its own thread. Now, not anymore, meaning a great improvement in performance.
9 bugs were closed.
9 4diac applications were developed that execute more than 1300 test on FORTE's code.
More than 80% coverage.
A CI (continuous integration) was set to execute all tests on each commit, using both branch versions of open62541.
0 compilation warnings / 0 cppcheck warnings nor errors.
I like it already, how do I use it?
You need to use the develop branch of FORTE. The usage has changed a little, but the documentation is already up
online
. The main changes are which Function Blocks are used for different OPC UA capabilites and how does the ID looks like.
So, please use it, test it and open bugs for it. And of course, if you want to contribute to it, please do it by pushing your changes to FORTE's branch "feature/MO44GA" which will trigger the CI.
Cheers,

GSoC Project - Final Report on Improving Dynamic Type Loading
2019-08-29
Age: 423 days
Hey All!
Here is the last update on my GSoC project. The last phase is now finished and we tried to finalize everything. With this last update, I want to give you an overview of everything that has been done and everything I learned throughout the project.
roadmap
on the bugs I found. After some minor bugfixes, I started fixing the bigger ones. e.g.
Fixing adapter problems
Unfortunately, I was not able to fix all identified bugs. Eventhough the project is finished with this month, I want to keep working with the Eclipse 4diac team and especially on the dynamic type loader.
To summarize my experience with GSoC and the Eclipse 4diac Team, it was incredible. Not only that I learned a new programming language, Lua, I got to know Xtend, an extension for the Java language itself and also an overlook of the C++ programming language. I also worked a lot in the Eclipse 4diac IDE itself, getting to know the whole programming environment. But the most important thing was to get to know an open and communicative community, that helped me with every problem I had. I had a really splendid time working on this project and want to thank you all for your assistance and help throughout the project.
Thank you all!
Cheers,

Happy Birthday Eclipse 4diac!
2019-07-23
Age: 460 days
12 years ago a small group of researchers presented the first public version of Eclipse 4diac at the 2007 IEEE Conference on Industrial Informatics in Vienna. Our baby made major steps in its early life, now just passing grade school and already helping a lot of people out there.
Cheers,
The 4diac Team

opc_ua[ACTION;ENDPOINT;PAIR1;PAIR2;...]
ACTION: Mandatory field and can have the following values (all in upper case):
READ
WRITE
CREATE_METHOD
CALL_METHOD
SUBSCRIBE
CREATE_OBJECT
DELETE_OBJECT
CREATE_VARIABLE
DELETE_VARIABLE
ENDPOINT: Mandatory and restricted part when using for remote actions. It must end with a '#' character.
Example: opc.tcp://192.168.0.100:4840#
PAIR: In the format BROWSENAME,NODE_ID (separated by a comma ','). When possible, NODE_ID can be omited, in which case the comma ',' must also be omitted. If the BROWSENAME is to be omited (when possible) the ',' must be present.
BROWSENAME: Browsepath to the node and must always start with a slash '/'. A colon before the name allows defining the namespace of the browsename of the current element. The default namespace of browsename is 1, except for the first part which defaults to zero. This is because in most cases the first part to access is in namespace 0. If you want to create something directly under /Root, you should then specify your namespace, for example /1:directUnderRoot. This is valid for local and remote access
Example: /Objects/myFolder/myNode
Example: /Objects/2:myFolder/myNode -> In objects, it will look for a folder with name myFolder and namespace 2 and inside, the node with name myNode and namespace 1
NODE_ID: In the format NAMESPACE_INDEX:IDENTIFIER_TYPE=IDENTIFIER

NAMESPACE_INDEX: Number of the namepsace. If ignored, it defaults to 0. When ignored, the ':' must also be omitted
IDENTIFIER_TYPE: Can have the following values:
i: The nodeId is numeric
s: the nodeId is a string
b: the nodeId is a bytestring
g: the nodeId is GUID (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
IDENTIFIER: identifier according to the IDENTIFIER_TYPE
1:i=12345 -> namespace 1, numeric identifier 12345
3:s=hello -> namespace 3, string identifier "hello"
2:b=hello2 -> namespace 2, bytestring identifier hello2
s=hello5 -> namespace 0, string identifier "hello5"
PAIR Examples:
/Objects/myFolder/myNode,1:i=12345 -> Both browsepath and nodeId are provided
/Objects/myFolder/myNode1 -> browsepath is provided, the nodeId is omitted
,1:i=12345 -> browsepath is omitted, but nodeId is provided
PAIR Note: To decide if a node exists, the following rules apply:
If only the browsepath is present, a node exists if there's a node in that browsepath
If both browsepath and nodeId are given, a node exist if an existing node in the browsepath has the same nodeId as the provided one

If only nodeId is given, a node with the provided nodeId must exist in the address space
When creating a node (only locally) browsepath should be present.
ID Examples:
opc_ua[READ;/Objects/test1] -> read the local node /Objects/test1. Create the node if it doesn't exist with a random nodeId
opc_ua[READ;/Objects/test1,i=1] -> read the local node /Objects/test1. Create the node if it doesn't exits with a numeric node id 1 and namespace 0. If the node already exist and it has other nodeId, it will fail.
opc_ua[WRITE;/Objects/test1;/Objects/test1] -> Write nodes /Objects/test1 and /Objects/test1 from values in SD_1 and SD_2. Will create the nodes if they don't exist with random nodeIds. If they exist, it will write to them when triggered.
opc_ua[WRITE;opc.tcp://192.168.0.100:4840#;/Objects/test1;/Objects/test1] -> Write nodes /Objects/test1 and /Objects/test1 on remote from values in SD_1 and SD_2. If nodes aren't found, 4diac FORTE will look for them after some seconds until it finds them. Remote creation is not supported
* NOTE: depending on the action being performed, browsepath and/or nodeId are mandatory/optional. See the table below:
Remote/Local
Desired Action
Function Block to use
Restrictions
Local
READ
SUBSCRIBE
Number of Pairs should match the number of RDs. NodeId is optional. If browsename is omitted, it will look for the node using the nodeId and won't create any (because it doesn't know where to create it)

4diac 1.10.2: Second Maintenance Release for 4diac 1.10
2019-04-14
Age: 560 days
We are proud to announce the second maintenance release for Eclipse 4diac 1.10 providing 11 bug fixes for 4diac IDE, and 6 for 4diac FORTE.
As always please download, test, and report problems and bugs. For 1.9.x and 1.10.x users a simple
After working with OPC UA and real cases with different companies using different OPC UA stacks, we realized that the OPC UA module in FORTE wasn't reliable and often crashed, and wasn't easy to extend. Also, we noticed that other companies had the same problem. So we decided to make a deep clean-up of the OPC UA module and add the capabilities we found were needed.
So... what's new?
The changes were done in the FORTE code, and the main things include:
Client and server are completely separated. Using just clients capabilities won't start the server.
When using the client, if the connection is lost, FORTE will reconnect.
You can now look for nodes in remote server using not only the browsename, but also the Node ID.
You can set a desired Node ID (and name) for the variables you create in your local server. (Numeric, String and Bytestring).
You can easily integrate your own nodesets to FORTE's compilation.
You can easily add your own types.
Support of v0.3.0 and v1.0 versions of open62541.
But, how good is it actually?
Before, each Function Block has its own thread. Now, not anymore, meaning a great improvement in performance.
9 bugs were closed.
9 4diac applications were developed that execute more than 1300 test on FORTE's code.
More than 80% coverage.
A CI (continuous integration) was set to execute all tests on each commit, using both branch versions of open62541.
0 compilation warnings / 0 cppcheck warnings nor errors.
I like it already, how do I use it?

showed two 4diac-based demonstrators at the
Inspire Automation Camp
from 25th to 27th February organized by
Festo
in Esslingen.
A Pick-and-Place module demonstrates the skill-based approach for an automation system using OPC UA. The module consists of a vertical axis, a horizontal axis, a gripper and a conveyor belt that are controlled by a Festo CECC-D, an emBrick, a Kunbus RevolutionPi and an INSYS MRX3 respectively. This engineering approach hides the implementation complexity on the target system by providing a standardized interface to the process via skills. The gripper, for example, is controlled by a skill
You need to use the develop branch of FORTE. The usage has changed a little, but the documentation is already up
online
. The main changes are which Function Blocks are used for different OPC UA capabilites and how does the ID looks like.
So, please use it, test it and open bugs for it. And of course, if you want to contribute to it, please do it by pushing your changes to FORTE's branch "feature/MO44GA" which will trigger the CI.

GSoC Project - Final Report on Improving Dynamic Type Loading
2019-08-29
Age: 423 days
Hey All!
Here is the last update on my GSoC project. The last phase is now finished and we tried to finalize everything. With this last update, I want to give you an overview of everything that has been done and everything I learned throughout the project.
roadmap
on the bugs I found. After some minor bugfixes, I started fixing the bigger ones. e.g.
Fixing adapter problems
Unfortunately, I was not able to fix all identified bugs. Eventhough the project is finished with this month, I want to keep working with the Eclipse 4diac team and especially on the dynamic type loader.

This is somewhat by design, but still worth improving

Maybe type editor as a context menu entry instead?
Improve literal value editing for input ports

that can be called via OPC UA.
The second demonstrator shows 4diac's TSN capabilities by sending two streams, a prioritized TSN stream and a non-prioritized best-effort stream, between two Beaglebone Black devices via 3 TTTech Akro 6/0 TSN switches. All devices have a common time base, which is achieved by the Precision Time Protocol (IEEE1588 - PTP). The prioritized stream is synchronized to a specific sending time point. The demonstrator shows on the one hand how 4diac uses the deterministic features of TSN, which means that the transmission of packets can be guaranteed and on the other hand that synchronizing the application and network schedule reduces latency and jitter of the transmitted packets.

We Want You to Participate in Google Summer of Code
2019-02-28
Age: 605 days
You are a student currently working or planning to work with 4diac and looking for a summer project? We have something for you! 4diac is participating in Google Summer of Code 2019. This means that Google may sponsors your project with 4diac.
We got you interested? Then please consider the following points:
Get in contact with us to discuss potential project topics on our
mailing list
For inspiration we compiled
first project ideas
To summarize my experience with GSoC and the Eclipse 4diac Team, it was incredible. Not only that I learned a new programming language, Lua, I got to know Xtend, an extension for the Java language itself and also an overlook of the C++ programming language. I also worked a lot in the Eclipse 4diac IDE itself, getting to know the whole programming environment. But the most important thing was to get to know an open and communicative community, that helped me with every problem I had. I had a really splendid time working on this project and want to thank you all for your assistance and help throughout the project.
Thank you all!
Cheers,

"Attributes" property sheet should use new add/delete/reorder widget
Resource View
Boxes around individual applications
Rationale:
No overlap => resource view becomes much more usable
Different visual => less likely to confuse app editor and resource editor
Draw a shaded box around/behind each application
Nested boxes for subapps
Separate application boxes
Allow to collapse application boxes
System Explorer
Add a search field
Contra: use eclipse's global search instead

For this i have created a road map of bugs in
Bugzilla
. After this is done, i am going to start to fix this bugs.
I will also keep track of the errors and their causes in my
Errorsheet
.
Final Report
In this section, will give a brief overview on the current state we are now in, a reference to all the code i wrote and what bugs we did not manage to finish.
There is now a documentation, on how to get the Lua JIT into the 4diac FORTE and to use the Dynamic Type Loader.
All arithmetic operations are working (e.g. multiplication, division).
All until now verfied issues with adapter are resolved and should be working correctly.

Use 4DIAC locally Tutorial - Monitor
on how to do that.
In UaExpert drag the two variables
Flip
and
Flop
into the Data Access View. Here you can now change the value of
Flip
. This will cause the IND port of SUBSCRIBE to fire an event and FORTE will read the new variable value, negate it and set
Q
to the negated value. The REQ event of the PUBLISH FB has to be triggered to set the new value from SD_1 in the address model of OPC UA (
Flop
variable). Note that in the beginning both values will be
false
since no event has been triggered yet.
In FORTE check the monitored application to see what happens there if you change a variable.
Adder Application using Variables
Here you can see another example how to use SUBSCRIBE and PUBLISH to create an IEC 61499 application which adds two values, by reading the values from an OPC UA variable and providing the result.

If you followed the steps before you should be able to create a new Application which looks like this:
Try to understand from where the names for
Num1
,
Num2
, and
Result
come from.
You can then drag the variables into UaExpert's Data Access View and change the values of
Num1
and
Num2
. The value of
Result
should then be the sum of those two values.

conflict in key binding ctrl+up
In our currently running
usability survey
a hotspot for disappointment is showing up, namely the application deployment. Interestingly we started on this already in the last release. With 4diac 1.10. the following improvements are available:
No more connection refused error messages:
4diac IDE automatically deactivates monitoring if needed and after the deployment re-enables it.
No more invalid state error messages:
Deployment checks the running resources in a device and lets you overwrite them:
Deploy from where you want:
With a new deploy main menu and pop-up menu you can select deployable entities (i.e., resources, devices, or full systems) and deploy them on the fly.
We hope that this makes deploying a less painful experience in 4diac IDE.
Outlook
However we know that this is only a first step. More work is needed to fully get rid of the deployment perspective as a whole.
Furthermore there is a major disturbing step in deployment that we havenâ€™t talked about yet: FB type management. Every time you change an FB or create a new one, C++ code for the FB has to be created and 4diac FORTE needs to be recompiled.
In order to overcome this issue we added as experimental feature a dynamic type load option. Here 4diac IDE detects during deployment the availability of FB types and for missing types code is automatically generated and sent to 4diac FORTE. To enable this feature you need to compile 4diac FORTE with LUA enabled and change in the system configuration of your application the device profile to dynamic type load.
However bear in mind that this feature is still experimental. Nonetheless we need testers for it. So we are heavily looking for your feedback on it!
Your feedback really always helps and there are several ways to provide it:
from 25th to 27th February organized by
Festo
in Esslingen.
A Pick-and-Place module demonstrates the skill-based approach for an automation system using OPC UA. The module consists of a vertical axis, a horizontal axis, a gripper and a conveyor belt that are controlled by a Festo CECC-D, an emBrick, a Kunbus RevolutionPi and an INSYS MRX3 respectively. This engineering approach hides the implementation complexity on the target system by providing a standardized interface to the process via skills. The gripper, for example, is controlled by a skill
gripper
that can be called via OPC UA.
The second demonstrator shows 4diac's TSN capabilities by sending two streams, a prioritized TSN stream and a non-prioritized best-effort stream, between two Beaglebone Black devices via 3 TTTech Akro 6/0 TSN switches. All devices have a common time base, which is achieved by the Precision Time Protocol (IEEE1588 - PTP). The prioritized stream is synchronized to a specific sending time point. The demonstrator shows on the one hand how 4diac uses the deterministic features of TSN, which means that the transmission of packets can be guaranteed and on the other hand that synchronizing the application and network schedule reduces latency and jitter of the transmitted packets.

This example shows you how you can use a
CLIENT
Create a new System which includes two devices: One for the remote server and one for the local variable read/write. By running two FORTE instances on your local PC, it is possible to simulate the use-case where the server and client are in separate FORTE instances. The server could for example run on a device offering the variables, the client is then another device which requests information of the previous one.
To start two FORTE instances on the same PC, you can pass the port on the command line, e.g.,
./forte -c localhost:61500
The system configuration should then look like this:
Then we create the following application. On the server side we create an OPC UA variable
/Objects/Increment
(
SUBSCRIBE_1
). When a client writes to this variable, it will be incremented (F_ADD) and then written to another OPC UA variable at
/Objects/Incremented
(
PUBLISH_1
).

Bugzilla bug
Still Open
Unfortunately i could not finish all of the open bugs, as many of them where much more complicated than expected. I will list all of the bugs here tht are still open and need treatment. Although they are open, i had some some ideas in mind on how to fix them.
Structured Text Functions (e.g. SQRT, LOG)
Bugzilla bug
Duartion Literals
Bugzilla bug
: Duration literals are a bit tricky, as the format, on how they are written varies between Eclipse 4diac, Lua and C. It has to be decide, on how to handle these literals in Lua and how they are then converted into the right format in C.
Bitwise/Logical Operators are not working
Bugzilla bug
: To differentiate between bitwise and logical operators in Lua, we have to evaluate the expression written in structured text. This means if the result from this expression is either a bit result (e.g. <, >=) or a byte/int etc. result (e.g. 0110 & 1100, which yields 0100). My idea is to evaluate expressions like (5 < 7) & ((9 | 1) > (3*2)) recursively, to find out if the LHS and RHS yield boolean result. If they do, we know the & is a logical operator, otherwise it is a bitwise operator.

On the client side we create a
CLIENT_1_0
FB which should write a number to the variable on the remote server. To read the incremented value from the server, we use a
CLIENT_0_1
FB, which reads the variable's value as soon as the REQ event is triggered.
Do not forget to connect the
COLD/WARM
events in the ressource view to the
INIT
Deploy the application to two forte. You can access the server variables using UaExpert. For the client, you can monitor the system. When you trigger the InputValue.REQ event, the client will write the number 42, and will then read the Incremented value where the new value will be present. The changes will be seen also in UaExpert

Understanding FORTE code
FORTE
Deploy the Application to FORTE
Open UaExpert and you should see the following address model:
Optionally you can again monitor the application in 4diac
In UaExpert Right-Click on the Method Node
AddValues
and select Call.
You can see that the name of the input and output arguments are the names of data outputs of the server FB. Enter values for
RD_1
and
RD_2
and press Call. FORTE will trigger the IND event of the SERVER FB, which causes the F_ADD FB to calculate the sum of the two numbers. When the sum is ready, the RSP event on SERVER is triggered and the result is returned to the calling OPC UA Client, which is in this case UaExpert.
Note:
After the IND event is triggered, the result has to be ready (i.e., the RSP event has to be triggered) within 4 seconds. This is the default timeout for a method call. Otherwise the call will fail with a timeout error code.

OPC UA Method call
To call the method from the example before, the application would look like this (in this case, it will send 43 and 10 as inputs to the method):
Try to deploy both applications and trigger the method call from the client and get the result from the method in the Result FB.
OPC UA Client Subscriptions
In this step you will see how you can create an OPC UA data subscription in an IEC 61499 application. It is used to set up a data subscription to variables on an OPC UA server to get the value changes as they appear on the server. It uses the

Topic 2: Improve Dynamic Code Loading
Eclipse 4diac allows to program a wide variety of devices (e.g., PLCs from different vendors, RaspberryPI, BeagleBone Black, Lego Mindstorms). In order to address this we have a feature that deploys user programs utilizing the Lua programming language and the Lua virtual machine. However this is feature is highly experimental. It would require further testing, stabilization and some features are missing. A starting point can be these open bugs:
bug 510941
support DurationLiteral in Lua
bug 510956
support DurationLiteral in Lua export
bug 529609
support re-implemented FBs of the IEC 61131-3 standard lib for lua export

Improving 4diac Deployment
2019-01-06
Age: 658 days
In our currently running
usability survey
a hotspot for disappointment is showing up, namely the application deployment. Interestingly we started on this already in the last release. With 4diac 1.10. the following improvements are available:
No more connection refused error messages:
4diac IDE automatically deactivates monitoring if needed and after the deployment re-enables it.
No more invalid state error messages:
Deployment checks the running resources in a device and lets you overwrite them:

Comparing negative values
IEC61131-3 Equals block
With the mbedtls compile, you need to compile open62541 with security (remember that only v1.0 is supported to be used with security enabled in 4diac Forte). For that, you need to set the UA_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION to true, which will show some new variables in CMake (MBEDCRYPTO_LIBRARY, MBEDTLS_INCLUDE_DIRS, MBEDTLS_LIBRARY and MBEDX509_LIBRARY). Set them to library files and folders according to their name. After that, you compile open62541 as before.
With open62541 compiled with encryption, you need now to compile forte with encryption. In CMake, set the variable FORTE_COM_OPC_UA_ENCRYPTION to true. This will also make appear new variables, similar as in open62541:
FORTE_COM_OPC_UA_ENCRYPTION_INCLUDE_DIR: include folder in the mbedtls build directory
FORTE_COM_OPC_UA_ENCRYPTION_LIB_DIR: folder in build directory of mbedtls where the three libaries are. You could add many directories separated by a semicolon
After that, compile forte as usual.
With forte compiled with encryption, you will need a CONFIG_FILE to write the security configurations for the endpoints to be connected by forte. The file must be written in a key=value way (no blank space between them). When trying to connect to a server, forte will read the file and look for an "ednpoint" key until it finds one whose value matches the one he's connecting to and read the following lines until the end of the file or until it finds another "endpoint" key. That means that to configure an endpoint, you write it first followed by the configurations for it. The allowed keys are:
endpoint: string where to connect to. Example opc.tcp://192.168.1.150:4840
username: string to be used as username. Example john
password: string to be used as password. Example doe
certificate: certificate file. Example /home/user/myCertificate/my_certificate.der
privateKey: private key file. Example /home/user/myCertificate/my_key.der
securityMode: integer. 1: None (default); 2:Sign; 3: Sign and encrypt
securityPolicy: string URI. For example http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#Basic256. Defaults to http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#None
The example file will look like this (let's call it configSecurity.forte):

Deploy from where you want:
With a new deploy main menu and pop-up menu you can select deployable entities (i.e., resources, devices, or full systems) and deploy them on the fly.
We hope that this makes deploying a less painful experience in 4diac IDE.
Outlook
However we know that this is only a first step. More work is needed to fully get rid of the deployment perspective as a whole.
Furthermore there is a major disturbing step in deployment that we havenâ€™t talked about yet: FB type management. Every time you change an FB or create a new one, C++ code for the FB has to be created and 4diac FORTE needs to be recompiled.
In order to overcome this issue we added as experimental feature a dynamic type load option. Here 4diac IDE detects during deployment the availability of FB types and for missing types code is automatically generated and sent to 4diac FORTE. To enable this feature you need to compile 4diac FORTE with LUA enabled and change in the system configuration of your application the device profile to dynamic type load.
However bear in mind that this feature is still experimental. Nonetheless we need testers for it. So we are heavily looking for your feedback on it!
Your feedback really always helps and there are several ways to provide it:

The username and password, in theory, be used without compling the encryption libraries, but even in some tests where the security was just username and password and the security mode was NONE, the certificate and private key were needed.
Once you have the file, you need to tell forte to look for it, and for that, you should start forte and pass the flag "-oc CONFIG_FILE"
$ ./forte -oc configSecurity.forte
You're done. Now, when your application tries to connect to opc.tcp://192.168.1.150:4840, it will use the configuration you set in the configSecurity.forte file.

Idea: Function Block Constraint Language (FBCL)
How should we handle the constraints related to individual FB types?
How should we handle the semantic issues of individual FB types?
When creating a Function Block Type in 4diac IDE, users could specify constraints on the particular FB type using a declarative representation (not necessarily a textual DSL) or a graphical interface. e.g. something like MustHaveValue constraints or preventing loops on certain FB types)
The constraint elements could be saved in .fbt files. Once loaded, they could be translated to OCL constraints and additional Java code.
Final report
In this section, I give a brief overview of the current state of this project and a reference to all the code I wrote during the summer.
By the end of my GSoC project, I created a set of OCL constraints at the ECC and Application level. Altogether, 16 constraints have been created:

Topic 1: Code-Generator for Raspberry Pi
Eclipse APP4MC integrates the Amalthea System Model that allows, among others, to describe the structure of software. In order to verify the timing behavior of software, your task is to generate code out of models that is compileable and executable on e.g. a Raspberry Pi.
(
Skills required:
Java, C/C++ beneficial)
Specific work that this could involve includes:
create a C or C++ file based on the content of an AMALTHEA model
annotate these with waiting methods that delay execution according to their execution time
implement inter-task communication
In case you have no access to a Raspberry Pi, we can provide you with SSH-Access to one located in our facilities.
Example:
Let us assume we have a model with one Task t1 and two Runnables r1 and r2. If Runnables r1 and r2 are executed as part of task t1, the generated C-Code could look similar to the following listing:

At the beginning of the project, I implemented a simple dialog window for displaying the results of the violated constraints. It was a preliminary prototype only for testing purposes. Later, we decided to improve the UI and use the Problems tab of Eclipse. The current implementation has several cool features:
Displaying description, resource, path, location and severity(Error, Warning, Info) of the problem
Better Error Marker support: When the user double clicks on one of the lines in the Problems View, the framework automatically selects the corresponding model element on which the constraint is violated (at the ECC level)
The automatic invocation of the OCL validation: When the user saves the currently edited model, the validation is automatically invoked.

Merge branch '1.13.x' into master for emergency fix for 1.13.0 release
HEAD
The Amalthea platform tools in Eclipse APP4MC allow users to distribute data and tasks to the target hardware platforms, with the focus on optimization of timing and scheduling. Your task is to extend these tools with an visualization of the progress along with (preliminary) results.
(
Skills required:
Java)
Specific work that this could involve includes:
Extract metrics from APP4MC, e.g. the number of tasks, runnables, min/avg/max communications per task/label/runnable, the best quality of the partitioning/mapping tool, ...
Select a library that is suitable for visualizing these metrics e.g. Eclipse SWTChart
Create an own extension for the APP4MC tools that implements the visualization of the current progress resp. the quality metrics.
Possible mentor:
Lukas Krawczyk
Topic 4: Task Visualizer
In order to simulate the execution of tasks on a specific hardware platform, APP4MC contains a
Task Visualizer
. Your task is to extend the Task Visualizer by communication dependencies.

Future work
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to implement constraints on the Xtext side. Even though the project is finished with this month, I want to keep working with the Eclipse 4diac team. I would like to get familiar with the 4diac Xtext implementation and check whether it would be advantageous to use well-formedness rules there.

Topic 5: CPU-GPU Response Time and Mapping Analysis
Modern automotive software tends to run on more centralized high performance machines that typically consist of several heterogeneous CPUs but also accelerators and GPUs. With this (Topic 5) project, typical response time analysis for fixed priority mixed preemptive scheduling must be advanced to consider weighted round robin (WRR) scheduling for the GPU(s), task chain latencies should be calculated, and an appropriate mapping approach should be found (such as constraint programming, an evolutionary algorithm, ILP, ACO, ...) to optimize the task to processing unit mapping and minimize response times. Therefore, tasks can comprise different

Eclipse CBI
Eclipse CBI (Common Build Infrastructure) is a set of tools and best practices for building projects at the Eclipse Foundation.
Topic 1: Improve Eclipse Digital signature services
The Eclipse Foundation provides Digital Signature services for various kind of artifacts (Java Jar, Windows executable (PE Authenticode), macOS .app and .dmg). Those services are implemented as web services (
https://git.eclipse.org/c/cbi/org.eclipse.cbi.git/tree/webservice/signing
) with a REST endpoint to sign a file.
Topic 1.1 Add authentication
The web services are currently not authenticated, they rely on the network topology to implement access restriction. The goal is to add authentication to those webservices. An OAuth2 service will be used to provide the authentication service.

Topic 1.2: Add asynchronous endpoints
Currently, the endpoints are synchronous: one POSTs a file to be signed, the server signs the file and returns the result in the response body. This is a naive implementation and should be augmented with an asynchronous variant: one POSTs a file to be signed and gets a token from the server. The server signs the file in the background. User can then poll the server with the token to query whether the file is ready or not. Instead of polling, the initial POST could also open a WebSocket waiting to be notified by the server when the file is ready. The endpoint main client (maven plugins:
https://git.eclipse.org/c/cbi/org.eclipse.cbi.git/tree/maven-plugins
) will need to be updated to benefit from the new asynchronous endpoints.
Skills required:
Java, REST, Maven
Possible mentor:
Mikaël Barbero
Topic 2: Implement a Dashboard about apps running in a Kubernetes cluster
CBI is currently in the process of migrating all the Jenkins instances it manages (
https://ci.eclipse.org
) to a Kubernetes (OpenShift) cluster. The goal of this topic is to implement a dashboard listing all Jenkins instances running in the Kubernetes cluster (similar to
https://ci.eclipse.org
) but with live data from the cluster (pod status, resource usage, Jenkins queue size etc...). The dashboard will run itself in the cluster. Server side implementation will preferably be in Java, Rust or Go while the dashboard client will preferably be implemented as a set of reusable React JS components.

Eclipse SUMO: Simulation of Urban Mobility
SUMO
is a free and open traffic simulation suite. SUMO allows modelling of intermodal traffic systems including road vehicles, public transport and pedestrians. Included with SUMO is a wealth of supporting tools which handle tasks such as route finding, visualization, network import and emission calculation. SUMO can be enhanced with custom models and provides various APIs to remotely control the simulation.
The goal of our GSoC project is to make SUMO more accessible for users of graphical user interfaces and facilitate alternative ways of setting up and interacting with the simulation. Specific work that this could involve includes:
Development of GUI-elements to visualize critical situations and locations in a traffic simulation
Development of interfaces and connections to external (live) data, e.g., General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) for public transport
Development of GUI-elements to visualize public transport timetables and public transport networks
Initial concept and development for a model describing the dynamics of (container) ships
Development of 3D visualization components for SUMO (open scene graph, Web3D, HTC Vive)

Eclipse Hono
Eclipse Hono™ provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol.
If you have any questions you may contact us on the
mailto:hono-dev@eclipse.org
mailing list.
Topic 1: Create a new protocol adapter
Eclipse Hono is all about abstracting protocols for IoT. We already have MQTT, plain HTTP, Coap, and last year's GSoC brought us AMQP 1.0. So it only makes sense to pick another protocol this year and do an implementation for Eclipse Hono.
This topic requires you to:
Pick a protocol you want to add (as part of your proposal)
Define mappings between the Hono telemetry, event, and command & control API and the chosen protocol
Implement the protocol adapter in Java, using your mapping definition, re-using the existing infrastructure, and maybe re-using an exiting protocol implementation
Provide unit and integration tests
Add the new protocol adapter to the existing deployment scripts
Amend the documentation to cover the new protocol adapter
The task here is not to write a new protocol implementation, but rather to use an existing protocol implementation and create a mapping to the Hono system (aka
protocol adapter
). For example, in last year's GSoC the task was to implement an AMQP protocol adapter, by re-using the existing Proton AMQP library.

Eclipse SWTChart
SWTChart is a powerful library to create charts and display data using SWT. So, it can be easily used in Java desktop applications. Only a few lines of code are necessary to create interactive and feature rich charts:
The source code is located here and can easily be cloned:
https://github.com/eclipse/swtchart/
If you are interested in one of the topics you have to apply on the
mailing list
.
Topic 1: Extending the export options
Many export options are contained already, e.g. to export to bitmaps as well as to scripts. The R script option is really helpful, especially when preparing scientific charts for publication. As the data is stored in a generic way, many different export options can be implemented. The task of topic 1 would be to add/extend the options: *.svg, *.eps, *.pdf and to put a pre-configured LaTeX table into the clipboard.

Eclipse Vert.x
Topic 1: Reactive relational database client
Eclipse Vert.x currently supports relational database using JDBC and a PostgreSQL Client. The PostgreSQL client can be extended to supports other relational databases, reusing the current client API and internal architecture.
A student willing to work on this project should have some basic knowledge in relational databases and be capable of reading and understanding database access protocols which are publicly available such as the PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLServer protocols.
The student should also be able to use networking tools such as Wireshark or TCP dump which can be useful for developing such protocols in a client.
Finally the student must also have a good pro-efficiency with the Java language, event driven architectures and Java concurrency in general.
The goal is to implement the Service Provider Interface of a non-blocking database client for the MSSQL database which are openly and clearly documented:
develop the set of command to authenticate and close a connection to an SQL Server database
develop query execution (also known as simple queries) and retrieve results from the database
implement value mapping between SQL types and Java types
develop prepared queries creation and retrieve prepared query metadata for performing client slide validation and decoding

Topic 2: Full polyglot support of TypeScript (outside vert.x APIs)
Eclipse Vert.x is a polyglot reactive runtime that fully supports
TypeScript
in the form of
ES4X
. Support is currently provider in the form of:
proper type hinting
compile time validation
generated type definitions
However if libraries are used that were not specifically written for use with vert.x no help is available. This project would be to enhance/extend the current tooling to extract basic class metadata to generate a bare type definition file(s) for non vert.x API jars.
A student willing to work on this project should have some basic knowledge in TypeScript and be capable of using tools available with any JDK such as:
jar
javap
The goal is to implement a tool, that given a random jar file, will generate a set of TypeScript definition files for each public class/interface. The format is already well defined in the vert.x project, which makes the task of the student a bit simpler:

Eclipse SW360
Eclipse SW360 supports software development by managing a component inventory for products and projects. The component inventory will be fed by build tool chains using a REST API and the inventory can help for a number of tasks: license compliance, vulnerability management, export control for "interesting" technologies, statistics about component usage, and so forth. Imagine a person in an organisation asking "I would like to know which products have commons-collections-3.2.1.jar?" (referring to the vulnerability that was reported once in 2017) - using SW360 as central component inventory can answer this question.
We from the Eclipse SW360 team would like to offer GOSC topics, if you are interested in the topic or technology. The SW360 technology stack is:
Java, Tomcat, Maven
Liferay as Web UI front end and Spring as REST front end
Couchdb for storing open source component source code (for scanning) and metadata, using Ektorp as Java POJO translator.

Please do not hesitate to ask questions to: sw360-dev@eclipse.org
Topic 1: Make Eclipse SW360 Fit for OSS Foundations
SW360 can be used for organizations in general: However, currently, the main input for use cases was coming from commercial organizations, companies. However, since SW360 is entirely open source software, how would use looks like for OSS foundations? Main use cases of foundations are about license compliance as well - for example ensuring license compatibility of involved OSS in the software project hosted by a foundation. The GSOC project proposes to implement an integration of Eclipse SW360 into the operations of the Eclipse Foundation. As such, as for the preparations, the relevant use cases and interaction with existing build hardware needs to be determined. Then, the project shall focus on three main use cases:
Component inventory feed by ci/cd chains using the SW360 REST API: an eclipse project uploads all dependencies
Automated license check for uploaded components which are dependencies of the projects
Support project view of all dependencies, if they are approved.
Possible mentors: t.b.d., candidate:
Michael C. Jaeger
Topic 2: Create a cool statistics dashboard
Currently, there is some overview as of tables, and users can export spreadsheets for drawing pie charts, but the latter requires export. SW360 users would greatly take advantage from charting that allows to select from predefined values:
Metric (for example, no. of components, no. of projects, avg. components per project, etc.)

About FreeRTOS
The main responsibility of the student will be to identify which operations of the LSP are missing in LSP4E, and to implement as much of them as possible, sorting out the value and difficulty of each feature to prioritize their work. This will involve comparing with Visual Studio Code (as it is the reference implementation of the LSP) and trying multiple languages to see the effect of proposed changes.
Communication and project development happens using professional OSS state-of-art practices: open by default, usage of public channels, Git, code review (with Gerrit), code quality...
From LSP4E and in the context of GSoC, the student may interact with other related projects and communities: Eclipse projects (upstream dependencies and downstream adopters), but also Language Server Protocol specification or existing language servers... This topic is a good entry point for students interested in the IDE/editors/languages domain as a whole since the LSP is related to many languages and many editors/IDEs. Since LSP is a hot topic of the domain, this experience and the interaction with various communities and organizations can be very profitable to bootstrap a career.

Eclipse Kura
Eclipse Kura™ is an extensible open source IoT Edge Framework based on Java/OSGi. Kura offers API access to the hardware interfaces of IoT Gateways (serial ports, GPS, watchdog, GPIOs, I2C, etc.). It features ready-to-use field protocols (including Modbus, OPC-UA, S7), an application container, and a web-based visual data flow programming to acquire data from the field, process it at the edge, and publish it to leading IoT Cloud Platforms through MQTT connectivity.
Topic 1: TensorFlow for Java in Kura
TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for high-performance numerical computation. This proposal requires you to acquire a basic knowledge of TensorFlow for Java and Eclipse Kura, in order to be able to wrap TensorFlow as a Kura bundle, exposing APIs that can be leveraged by other user applications. The resulting bundle should:

enable the user to train the neural network
Provide APIs that can be used by other applications to feed with new data the TensorFlow processing.
The integration should be completed by the creation of a specific Kura Wire component that has input ports for receiving messages from other Wire components, feeding the TensorFlow neural network. The Wire component is expected to have output ports for providing messages for downstream components in the graph that, for example, can publish messages to a remote cloud platform. The student should design and set up a real world use case example (i.e. predictive maintenance on vibration monitoring anomaly detection) where, using a Wire Graph, the data retrieved from the field, using industrial protocols, is processed by TensorFlow and produces an alert message when an unexpected behaviour is found. This alert message can then be published to a cloud platform.

Topic 2: Kura Driver for Bosch XDK110
The XDK110 device is an all-in-one sensor kit designed for rapid prototyping. It features up to 8 sensors, all housed in a small form factor, and can be connected via USB, Bluetooth or WLAN. The task requires the applicant to:
create a Kura Driver for the Bosch XDK110, supporting at least Bluetooth connectivity, and enabling the read of XDK sensors from an Asset in Kura Wires;
Design a Wire Graph that leverages the new Driver to match data, perform edge processing and publishing of results to a cloud platform
Amend the documentation to describe the new Driver
Update the Kura’s documentation examples section with the new use case based on the interaction between the framework itself and the Bosch XDK110.

Eclipse Vorto
The Eclipse Vorto project is part of the IoT Working Group projects and targets IoT Device manufacturers and Solution Developers integrating IoT devices with various platforms.
Topic 1: Eclipse Vorto LSP Server for Vorto IoT Language
Vorto provides a DSL to describe IoT devices and their capabilitities. The language is implemented with Eclipse XText. In order to support a wider range of 3rd party tools for Vorto language, e.g. Visual Studio .NET (Monaco), the idea here is to provide a LSP server for Vorto providing auto-completing, syntax highlighting, validation etc.
Possible mentors:
Alexander Edelmann
Topic 2: Vorto Code Generator for Eclipse Hono/Ditto Payload Mappings
The Eclipse Ditto project provides a connectivity API that allows developers to define payload transformation logic, in order to integrate IoT devices that send arbitrary payload via Eclipse Hono protocol adapters. Now the idea is to provide a Code Generator plugin that consumes Vorto Models for IoT devices and generate javascript transformation code that a developer can deploy "as-is" in the Eclipse Ditto service. This would allow a fast and easy integration of any device sending arbitrary telemetry data to the Eclipse Ditto service.
