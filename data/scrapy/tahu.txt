Eclipse Tahu is a set of references implementations for the Sparkplug specification. It addresses the existence of legacy SCADA/DCS/ICS protocols and infrastructures and provides a much-needed definition of how best to apply MQTT into these existing industrial operational environments.
Basic network architecture:
Tahu is currently addressing the following features required for MQTT centric IIoT:
Well-defined MQTT Topic Namespace applicable for the IIoT market
In order to be interoperable across the plethora of OEM device manufacturers of industrial equipment and the SCADA/HMI/Control/Cloud Services backend components that desired to subscribe to the resulting information a well-defined MQTT topic namespace needs to be defined. The topic namespace needs to be both efficient yet applicable to the applications that currently exist in the industrial market. The topic namespace needs to provide both the contextual information all the way to an individual device in the field, but also provide topic “verbs” to efficiently manage the “life cycle” of an MQTT session.
Efficient MQTT payload definition
Staying with the original intent of MQTT, the payload specification needs to stay “lean and mean” to best utilize low bandwidth networks (VSAT, Radio, Cellular). Not only does the payload need to be efficient, it needs to recognize the fact that the primary purpose of IIoT solutions is to provide Industrial Process Variable information from devices in the field to both SCADA/DCS/FCS OT solutions as well as line of business IT solutions.
MQTT STATE Management definition
MQTT has the awareness of the current MQTT session built in using the LWT feature. But for STATE aware OT applications like SCADA/DCS/FCS, there needs to be a succinct definition on how best to use MQTT’s built in STATE awareness in an overall SCADA/DCS/ICS infrastructure.
The Sparkplug specification provides all of the definitions and requirements listed above. In addition to the Sparkplug specification, Tahu will provide the required libraries and reference implementation code following the Sparkplug specification in:
C
Java
Javascript
Python
Tutorials on getting the reference implementation code running on popular open hardware platforms like the Raspberry Pi will also be included in Tahu.

Eclipse Tahu
Eclipse Tahu provide client libraries and reference implementations in various languages and for various devices
to show how the device/remote application must connect and disconnect from the MQTT server using the Sparkplug
specification explained below. This includes device lifecycle messages such as the required birth and last will &
testament messages that must be sent to ensure the device lifecycle state and data integrity.
Sparkplug
Sparkplug is a specification for MQTT enabled devices and applications to send and receive messages in a stateful way.
While MQTT is stateful by nature it doesn't ensure that all data on a receiving MQTT application is current or valid.
Sparkplug provides a mechanism for ensuring that remote device or application data is current and valid.
Sparkplug A was the original version of the Sparkplug specification and used Eclipse Kura's protobuf definition for
payload encoding. However, it was quickly determined that this definition was too limited to handle the metadata that
typical Sparkplug payloads require. As a result, Sparkplug B was developed to add additional features and capabilities
that were not possible in the original Kura payload definition. These features include:
Complex data types using templates
Datasets
Richer metrics with the ability to add property metadata for each metric
Metric alias support to maintain rich metric naming while keeping bandwidth usage to a minimum
Historical data
File data
Sparkplug B Specification:
https://www.eclipse.org/tahu/spec/Sparkplug%20Topic%20Namespace%20and%20State%20ManagementV2.2-with%20appendix%20B%20format%20-%20Eclipse.pdf

Eclipse Tahu
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse IoT
Background: MQTT was originally designed as a message transport for real-time SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. The MQTT message transport specification does not specify the topic namespace to use nor does it define the Payload representation of the data being published and/or subscribed to. In addition to this, since the original use case for MQTT was targeting real-time SCADA, there are mechanisms defined to provide the state of an MQTT session such that SCADA/Control HMI application can monitor the current state of any MQTT device in the infrastructure. As with the topic namespace and payload the way state information is implemented and managed within the MQTT infrastructure is not defined. All of this was intentional within the original MQTT specification to provide maximum flexibility across any solution sector that might choose to use MQTT infrastructures.
But at some point, for industrial MQTT based solutions to be interoperable within a given market sector, the topic namespace, payload representation, and session state must be defined. The intent and purpose of the Sparkplug specification is to define an MQTT topic namespace, payload, and session state management that can be applied generically to the overall IIoT market sector, but specifically meets the requirements of real-time SCADA/DSC (Distributed Control System)/ICS (Industrial Control System) OT solutions. Meeting the operational requirements for these systems will enable MQTT based infrastructures to provide more valuable real-time information to Line of Business MES/OEE/Track-and-Trace/Cloud Services solution requirements as well.
The purpose of the Sparkplug specification is to remain true to the original notion of keeping the topic namespace and message sizes to a minimum while still making the overall message transactions and session state management between MQTT devices and MQTT SCADA/DCS/ICS applications simple, efficient and easy to understand and implement.
This project proposal includes the Sparkplug specification itself, client libraries, and sample applications.
Scope: The scope of the Eclipse Tahu project consists of three major components:

Why Here?: Eclipse IoT is a good location for Eclipse Tahu for a number of reasons. We believe that one of the best features of this technology is providing consistency around how MQTT is used in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). There are a number of hardware/device manufacturers that have already implemented it natively as well as some cloud/application software companies. By open sourcing this technology through Eclipse IoT we believe it will accelerate the growth and adoption of it as well as provide a better and open forum for improvement and compatibility over time.
We also believe that there are a number of synergies with existing Eclipse IoT projects for Eclipse Tahu. These include but are not limited to:
Kura
Kapua
Milo
Mosquitto
NeoSCADA
Paho
Smarthome
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 2.0Legal Issues: We don't believe there are any legal issues but we would like some help in determining the best license for the Sparkplug specification itself.
Project Scheduling: The Sparkplug specification already exists as does the code. We'll need to do a bit of cleanup, refactoring, and completing the Eclipse legal review process but since we don't have too many dependencies we expect this should all happen fairly quickly. Rough estimates:
Initial contribution expected: 5/2018

First working build expected: 6/2018
Future Work:
Potential improvements/revisions of the Sparkplug specification.

Source Code
Initial Contribution: There are three primary components to Tahu. The first is the Sparkplug specification which is a document and will be released under a TBD license (creative commons maybe?). The other two components are both Sparkplug libraries and reference Sparkplug implementations using the libraries if C, Java, Javascript, and Python. All of these components will be included in the initial contribution.
The code is owned by Cirrus Link Solutions but has already been made available on a public Github site. This is the code that will be moved to Eclipse under Tahu. There are a number of OEM hardware manufacturers that are already using these libraries in their own commercial Sparkplug implementations.
With regard to third party licenses we have been careful all along to use 'Eclipse friendly' licenses. This is a list of third party dependencies:
Jackson-annotations - Apache Software License v2.0
Jackson-core - Apache Software License v2.0
Jackson-databind - Apache Software License v2.0
Protocol Buffers - New BSD License
Apache Commons IO - Apache Software License v2.0
Log4J - Apache Software License v2.0
Tutorials on getting the reference implementation code running on popular open hardware platforms like the Raspberry Pi will also be included in Tahu.

There are a number of hardware/device manufacturers that have already implemented it natively as well as some cloud/application software companies. By open sourcing this technology through Eclipse IoT we believe it will accelerate the growth and adoption of it as well as provide a better and open forum for improvement and compatibility over time.
We also believe that there are a number of synergies with existing Eclipse IoT projects for Eclipse Tahu. These include but are not limited to:
Kura
Kapua
Milo
Mosquitto
NeoSCADA
Paho
Smarthome
Initial Contribution: There are three primary components to Tahu. The first is the Sparkplug specification which is a document and will be released under a TBD license (creative commons maybe?). The other two components are both Sparkplug libraries and reference Sparkplug implementations using the libraries if C, Java, Javascript, and Python. All of these components will be included in the initial contribution.
The code is owned by Cirrus Link Solutions but has already been made available on a public Github site. This is the code that will be moved to Eclipse under Tahu. There are a number of OEM hardware manufacturers that are already using these libraries in their own commercial Sparkplug implementations.
With regard to third party licenses we have been careful all along to use 'Eclipse friendly' licenses. This is a list of third party dependencies:
Jackson-annotations - Apache Software License v2.0
Jackson-core - Apache Software License v2.0
Jackson-databind - Apache Software License v2.0
Protocol Buffers - New BSD License
Eclipse Paho - EPL v1.0
SLF4J - MIT License
NanoPB - https://github.com/metormote/nanopb/blob/master/LICENSE

NanoPB - https://github.com/metormote/nanopb/blob/master/LICENSE
Legal Issues: We don't believe there are any legal issues but we would like some help in determining the best license for the Sparkplug specification itself.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 2.0Project Scheduling: The Sparkplug specification already exists as does the code. We'll need to do a bit of cleanup, refactoring, and completing the Eclipse legal review process but since we don't have too many dependencies we expect this should all happen fairly quickly. Rough estimates:
Initial contribution expected: 5/2018
First working build expected: 6/2018
Future Work:
Potential improvements/revisions of the Sparkplug specification.
Additional client library language support
Additional reference/sample applications
