The Ignite|IoT methodology has two main perspectives:
IoT Strategy Execution: This perspective looks at IoT strategy from an enterprise perspective, including IoT strategy definition, IoT opportunity identification, IoT business case and IoT programme management.
IoT Solution Delivery: This perspective looks at the individual IoT solution and the related project. Note that it defines the interfaces to the related asset and its organization, but usually excludes design and manufacturing of the asset itself.
The Ignite|IoT solution delivery perspective is currently the more detailed one and can be broken down as follows:
IoT Solution Lifecycle: This perspective focuses on planning, building and running IoT solutions.
IoT Building Blocks: This perspective contains re-usable artifacts from successful projects, including Project Dimensions, Architecture Blueprints and Technology Profiles.
IoT Project DB: This is a database of reference projects that have been analyzed in order to extract best practices for the IoT building blocks and the Solution Lifecycle Perspective.
The IoT Solution Lifecycle contains the following elements:
Initial Project Design: This design blueprint builds on the elements defined as part of the generic IoT Building Blocks, including project self-assessment using Project Dimensions, solution architecture leveraging Architecture Blueprints and technology selection leveraging Technology Profiles.
Project Work streams: This blueprint defined the top level Work streams typically found in an IoT solution project. A checklist for each Work stream is provided, plus a list of common dependencies between the Work steams.
The IoT Building Blocks consist of the following elements:
Project Dimensions: This is a precursor of formal project requirements. Project dimensions are used for project self-assessment, project comparisons, architecture and technology selection, etc.
Architecture Blueprints: Building on existing architecture blueprints (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture), this adds new architectural perspectives required for IoT project and provides a superstructure to integrate the different required architectural perspectives.
Technology Profiles: Identifies and describes the most important technologies usually required for IoT projects. Leverages IoT architecture perspectives to describe where in the overall IoT architecture these different technologies fit in. Attempts to link back to project dimensions to support technology selection.

Eclipse Kuksa
Internet of Things
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

The mission of the top-level project is to provide open source technology that will be used to build IoT solutions for industry and consumers. It will focus on:
Standards and Protocols implementations that can easily be consumed by end solution developers as well as framework developers
Frameworks and Services that abstract the complexity of hardware, communication and data stack manipulation
Tools that facilitate the development of connected systems
Solutions that build ready-to-run solutions based on the other building blocks
This document describes the composition and organization of the project, roles and responsibilities of the participants, and development process for the project.

Scope:
The Ignite|IoT methodology is for IoT product managers, project managers, solution architects and other IoT stakeholders. The goal is to make IoT best practices available in the form of a technology independent, reusable, open source methodology which supports IoT solution design as well as IoT project set-up and management by providing project templates, checklists and solution architecture blueprints.
