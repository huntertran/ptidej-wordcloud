About RISE V2G
Eclipse RISE V2G is a Reference Implementation Supporting the Evolution of the Vehicle-2-Grid communication interface ISO/IEC 15118.
The international standard ISO/IEC 15118, entitled "Road vehicles - Vehicle to grid communication interface", defines a digital IP-based communication interface between an electric vehicle (EV) and a charging station (named Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment - EVSE). It allows for a user-friendly "plug-and-charge" mechanism for authentication, authorisation, billing, and flexible load control based on a wide set of information exchanged between the EV and EVSE.
A rise in the wide application of this standard is essential for reaching the goal of integrating EVs as flexible energy storage devices into a smart grid.
Mission Statement
The Eclipse RISE V2G project shall serve as an open source standard-compliant reference implementation and documentation. As such, the objective is to provide a test platform for interoperability testing and to offer an information resource for interested parties. The adoption of a new technology heavily depends on the interoperability of its various implementations. The more tests conducted, the more stable and reliable the developed solution will be.
As the ISO/IEC 15118 consists of eight documment parts - with part 1 to 3 defining use cases and requirements for conductive charging, parts 4 and 5 dealing with conformance tests, and parts 6 to 8 specifying use cases and requirements for inductive charging - the RISE V2G project shall evolve to cover all aspects of conductive and inductive charging from the physical layer up to the application layer. However, it requires a lot of work to be done to fulfil this endeavor.
Your assistance would therefore be very appreciated, be it by testing this reference implementation against your own solution - this way uncovering possible bugs or making code optimisation suggestions - or by providing an implementation for yet missing parts.
Scope and current status
As this standard describes a client/server-based protocol with the EV being the client and the EVSE being the server, this reference implementation covers both entities. The charging process can be authenticated and authorised via a so-called plug-and-charge mechanism (PnC) or via external identification means (EIM) such as an RFID card. Furthermore, there are several message sets defined for AC (alternating current) and DC (direct current) charging.
This project covers all defined message sets and identification means. It currently focuses on the implementation of part 2 (ISO/IEC 15118-2) of this standard defining the protocol requirements from the network up to the application layer (layer 3 to 7 of the ISO/OSI layer model) for the conductive charging scenario.
Eclipse RISE V2G allows you to create an EVCC instance acting as the client sending request messages related to the chosen charging scenario as well as an SECC instance acting as the server which is responding to those requests. EVCC stands for Electric Vehicle Communication Controller (inside the EV) whereas SECC is short for Supply Equipment Communication Controller (inside the EVSE).
The current status of the project consists of three subprojects which implement the conductive charging scenario:
the EVCC project covering its state machine and request messages
the SECC project covering its state machine and response messages
a shared project with common classes used by both entities
Credits
The code of the Eclipse RISE V2G project has its origin in the research project iZEUS, funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy and conducted at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.
The first prototype of an ISO/IEC 15118-2 implementation has been realised by the RISE V2G project lead within the course of that research project at the Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AFIB). This prototype has since been reworked and further enhanced at Chargepartner GmbH, a software-as-a-service specialist in the e-mobility market.

Getting Started
As the ISO/IEC 15118 defines a client-/server-based protocol, you can use RISE V2G's code to test the client representing the electric vehicle communication controller (EVCC) against the server representing a supply equipment communication controller (SECC, aka a charging station) or just use either client or server against your counterpart implementation.
Start the EVCC instance by running StartEVCC.java in the main package of the org.eclipse.risev2g.evcc project.
The SECC instance can be started by running StartSECC.java in the main package of the org.eclipse.risev2g.secc project.
The server must be started before the client tries to connect to the server running in the same network.
The third of the three provided projects, namely org.eclipse.risev2g.shared, is a required project on the build path of both the EVCC and the SECC side as it holds common classes and libraries used by both entities.
Note that this project relies on a Java 8 runtime environment.

Both the EVCC and the SECC have a properties file called EVCCConfig.properties and SECCConfig.properties respectively, residing in the root of each project. Take a look at these files to set the needed properties before starting the client and server instance. You can e.g. set the network interface on which the messages are to be exchanged, decide whether the EVCC wants to use TCP or TLS on the transport layer, and other parameters which are explained.
Using TLS And Certificates for XML Signatures
If the EVCC wants to communicate with the SECC via the secure TLS protocol (see setting in EVCCConfig.properties), then you need certain certificates and keys in order to make this communication work. The ISO/IEC 15118 protocol defines a set of certificates and cryptographic parameters which shall apply in case of a secure communciation.
To make things as easy for you as possible, you will find a generateCertificates.sh Shell script in the 'RISE V2G Certfiicates' folder (not part of the three projects, but residing on the same level) which automatically generates all necessary certificates, private and public keys as well as Java keystores in the respective folders for you.
You should have OpenSSL 1.0.2 (or above) installed to comply with all security requirements imposed by ISO/IEC 15118. For example, OpenSSL 0.9.8 does not come with SHA-2 for SHA-256 signature algorithms. All OpenSSL commands listed in the generateCertificates.sh file are explained for a better understanding.
If you are on a Windows machine, just rename the file ending from .sh to .bat.
Hint: If you run the genereateCertificates.sh script, make sure that the keystores folder which holds already generated Java keystores (.jks file ending) is empty.
After you executed the generateCertificates.sh script, you need to do the following:
Copy the files evccKeystore.jks and evccTruststore.jks from the keystores folder into the root of the org.eclipse.risev2g.evcc project (on the same level as EVCCConfig.properties).
Copy the files seccKeystore.jks and seccTruststore.jks from the keystores folder and the files contractCert.p12 and provServiceCert.p12 from the certs folder into the root of the org.eclipse.risev2g.secc project (on the same level as SECCConfig.properties).
Now you are ready to go.
Hint: If you already have the Java keystore files in the respective project roots but the TLS communication fails, you might need to generated the certificates and thus keystores again because of an expired contract certificate due to the limited validity period set in generateCertificates.sh file.
Communication Sessions and Interfaces
All session parameters and state information is hold in V2GCommunicationSessionEVCC.java (for the client) and V2GCommunicationSessionSECC.java (for the server) respectively.

Warning message
There are several interfaces available through which an actual EVCC or SECC instance can be realised:
An interface for the information exchange between the EVCC and the internal communication bus of the EV (e.g. CAN) in order to request the relevant charging parameters from the EV as well as to communicate e.g. charging profiles to the EV (see package evController)
An interface for the information exchange between the SECC and the internal controller of the EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment = charging station) in order to request status information (e.g. about the RDC and smart meter values) or open/close the contactors (see package evseController)
An interface for the communication with a backend (e.g. for further communication via e.g. the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP)) to request a charging profile for the respective EV (see package backend)
Each interface has a Dummy implementation for testing purposes.
You can configure which interface implementation to use in the constructors of the aforementioned V2GCommunicationSessionEVCC.java and V2GCommunicationSessionSECC.java files.
EXI Codec
The default codec for the enconding and decoding of EXI (Efficient XML Interchange) messages is OpenEXI (see package exiCodec in the org.eclipse.risev2g.shared project). You could as well use the EXIficient library if you include the EXIficient library in this project and change the codec setting in the constructor of the MessageHandler.java file (see package messageHandling of org.eclipse.risev2g.shared).
The EXIficient library can currently not be distributed because of a license incompatibility between this project's Eclipse Public License and EXIficient's GPL v3 license. However, you may include it on your system and you will find an EXIficientCodec.java file in the exiCode package which is ready to work with the EXIficient library.
Logging
Extensive logging through log4j is available and can be adjusted from debugging level to error level with the respective log4j2.xml file.

Hello, thank you again for your support. I also tried to rename the Network Interface field to "localhost" or "loopback" but I did not work neither.

Hmm, I would need to test it on a windows machine, but I cannot do it now (currently at work). Maybe later this evening I have the time.

So what did you put as the index value? 0, 1, 2, ...?
Jean-René Robin
@JeanReneRobin
2 on the OpenSUSE labtop, and 13 on the Windows one
Marc Mültin
@MarcMueltin
Thanks for testing, this is a very good example for me which helps improve my code for everyone. :+1:
Jean-René Robin
@JeanReneRobin
You´re welcome!What I though is that either the user set the Interface number himself in the .properties files, or the program itself test a range (2-20) of interfaces. 1 being the loop-back interface
Marc Mültin
@MarcMueltin
This could be a reasonable approach to automate the correct network interface

Eclipse RISE V2G Creation Review
Type: CreationState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, March 4, 2015Project: Eclipse RISE V2GCreation ReviewProposal:
RISE V2G
Parent Project: Eclipse IoTBackground: A worldwide increasing interest in technologies which are aiming towards the integration and control of producers of (renewable) energy, energy storage devices, consumer loads, and network operating equipment in a so-called “smart grid” can be observed worldwide. This integration can be achieved through the use of intelligent information and communication technology (ICT).
At the same time, the renaissance of the electric vehicle (EV) as an enabler technology for a more sustainable and a resource-saving means of transport as well as a mobile energy storage device is very much linked to the smart grid discussion. The breakthrough of electromobility can however only be achieved if the technology and communication flow related to the charging process of an EV is going to be standardised.
The ISO/IEC 15118 standard, entitled "Road vehicles – Vehicle-to-Grid Communication Interface", is a digital IP-based communication protocol which defines the communication between an EV and a charging station, also known as an Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). The communication mechanisms are defined with regards to the conductive as well as inductive charging process and allow for an automated authentication, authorisation, charge control and billing based on a single contract installed in the EV and without the need of further user interaction.
The source code of this project originates from the electromobility research project iZEUS (izeus.kit.edu) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology in the context of the ICT for Electromobility II initiative. The project lead of this Eclipse project is also an active member of the ISO/IEC 15118 standardisation body.
Scope: RISE V2G is a Reference Implementation Supporting the Evolution of the Vehicle-2-Grid communication interface ISO/IEC 15118 which provides an interoperable communication interface between an EV and an EVSE. A rise in the wide application of this standard is essential for reaching the goal of integrating EVs as flexible energy storage devices into a smart grid.
Description: RISE V2G allows you to create an EVCC instance acting as the client sending request messages related to the respective charging scenario as well as an SECC instance acting as the server which is responding to those requests. EVCC stands for Electric Vehicle Communication Controller (inside the EV) whereas SECC is short for Supply Equipment Communication Controller (inside the EVSE).
This project currently focuses on the implementation of part 2 (ISO/IEC 15118-2) of this standard [1] defining the protocol requirements from the network up to the application layer (layer 3 to 7 of the ISO/OSI layer model) for the conductive charging scenario. As this standard describes a client/server-based protocol with the EV being the client and the EVSE being the server, this reference implementation covers both entities. The charging process according to [1] can be authenticated and authorised via a so-called plug-and-charge mechanism (PnC) or via external identification means (EIM) such as an RFID card. Furthermore, there are several message sets defined for AC (alternatic current) and DC (direct current) charging. This project covers all defined message sets and identification means.
The current status of the project consists of three subprojects which implement the conductive charging scenario:
the EVCC project covering its state machine and request messages
the SECC project covering its state machine and response messages
a shared project with common classes used by both entities
The overall aim of this Eclipse project is to offer a reference implementation for all parts of the ISO/IEC 15118 standard.
There are several interfaces available through which an actual EVCC or SECC instance can be realised:
An interface for the information exchange between the EVCC and the internal communication bus of the EV (e.g. CAN) in order to request the relevant charging parameters from the EV as well as to communicate e.g. charging profiles to the EV
An interface for the information exchange between the SECC and the internal controller of the EVSE in order to request status information (e.g. about the RDC and smart meter values) or open/close the contactors for example
An interface for the communication with a backend (e.g. for further communication via the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP)) to request a charging profile for the respective EV
Extensive logging through log4j is available and can be adjusted from debugging level to error level.
Certain properties regarding the EV as well as EVSE can be configured in the respective .properties files (EV.properties and EVSE.properties respectively) in each subproject.
Note that this project relies on a Java 8 runtime environment.
[1] http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=55366
Why Here?: This project strives to serve as a reference implementation with open access in order to promote the wide adoption of this international standard and to enhance the electromobility experience in terms of ease of use for end customers charging their EVs at any charging station. With the Eclipse foundation being a respectable and trustworthy organisation with regards to their hosted projects, we encourage interested companies, research institutions and individuals to join this project and contribute to our goal.
Legal Issues: The messages transferred between the two entities EV and EVSE and EXI-encoded. EXI (Efficient XML Interchange) [1] is a very compact representation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML) format and reliably produces efficient byte-stream encodings of XML-based messages.
The only EXI library tested with the source code so far is EXIficient [2], which is published under the GPL v2. An interface has been created against which this EXIficient library has been tested, however, in order to comply to the EPL 1.0 requirements, this library is exchangeable with other libraries which could be licensed under different terms and conditions. The openV2G project [3] offers another implementation of an EXI codec, written in the C language and licensed under LGPL v3. Using a C-to-Java wrapper, this library could be used as well. Furthermore, openEXI [4] offers a Java/C# implementation under the Apache License V2.0.

Licenses: Eclipse Public License 1.0Project Scheduling: A first release of the implementation of ISO/IEC 15118-2 regarding AC and DC charging in EIM and PnC mode is planned by February/March 2015.
AC and DC charging in EIM mode is implemented and has been tested against a number of implementations from other companies on various testivals.
The implementation of the secure communication via a TLS channel, digital signatures and certificates is currently under development (update from January 14, 2015). It is the project owners intention to have a complete and fully compatible implementation of ISO/IEC 15118-2 with its first release.
Implementations regarding part 3 will be available by Q1/Q2 2015.
As the parts of the standard which define the inductive charging are not yet available as an international standard - or at least a final draft version - it cannot be stated exactly when a first implementation of those parts will be available.
Future Work:
Community efforts:
Building up the community by advertising this project at various companies and institutions which are interested in smart charging
Blog, Twitter, e-mobility newsletters, professional articels and news on company website
People
Project Leads: Marc MültinCommitters: Thomas GehlerPetko MirchevMarc MültinInterested Parties: All companies and institutes which are part of or cooperating with the eNterop (http://www.enterop.net/cms/index.php?page=home-en) research project. Furthermore, any company which is interested to enable their charging stations and electric vehicles to be able to communicate via this smart charging standard and which are interested in testing their implementation against a reference implementation. Last but not least, any experienced software developper who wants to be a part of this e-mobility project by inspecting the code and providing helpful suggestions with regards to code footprint reduction, stability and security.
