Review Information
This is the initial release of Eclipse Mita. Mita is a new programming language for IoT devices that targets developers who are new to embedded software development, specifically those who come from a cloud background. As a developer Mita feels like a modern programming language (in the vein of TypeScript), but translates to C code which compiles to native code running directly on the embedded hardware. Combining declarative configuration and powerful language features with code generation enables projects to scale their deployment over quantity - from the first prototype to shipping thousands of devices.
This release serves as a foundation for the future. With a big upcoming change, a complete rewrite of the typesystem, this is the last stable point for a while.
However Mita right now is pretty matured: there is a huge platform implemented, the XDK 110, as well as two smaller platforms that serve as a starting point for platform integrators.
For this purpose different documentation exists, such as a contribution guide and a platform integrators guide to help newcomers.
All the while this is a preview version and far from a 1.0 release, pertaining to the upcoming type system overhaul, improvements to the event system and a way to configure a more detailed life cycle for components.

Scope: Eclipse Mita aims to build a new programming language for the embedded IoT including editor/IDE, compiler and an extensive test-suite. Mita inherits the syntax of modern general-purpose system-level languages (e.g. Swift or Rust), but compiles to near-production ready C code. It offers powerful abstractions for sensor access, connectivity and general purpose IO. Centered around developer experience, it is build as a DSL using Eclipse Xtext.

However Mita right now is pretty matured: there is a huge platform implemented, the XDK 110, as well as two smaller platforms that serve as a starting point for platform integrators.
For this purpose different documentation exists, such as a contribution guide and a platform integrators guide to help newcomers.
All the while this is a preview version and far from a 1.0 release, pertaining to the upcoming type system overhaul, improvements to the event system and a way to configure a more detailed life cycle for components.
Architectural Issues: Architecturewise this release is the foundation for upcoming releases. As such there are some unpaid technical depts from when the project started. One of these is Statechart Tool's event system, which, while quite correct, is not feature complete enough for our purposes and language needs.
Furthermore there are some unimplemented features:
The event system is quite simple for now, however an improved draft exists
The lifecycle of components is as simple as possible: they all start and end with the device itself
There's a limit to how deep generated types (like arrays) can be nested. This is due to a limitation in the current API design.
Security Issues: There are no known security issues at the time of writing.
Non-Code Aspects: Eclipse Mita has the following guides and resources available:
An extensive documentation on the core language and platforms
A Getting Started guide for developers on how to contribute
A Platform Integrators guide (TBD soon) to help with extending Mita with new platforms
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verifiedUsability Details: Our language editors are based on Xtext which provides syntax highlighting and well implemented support for auto complete, validation and so on.
End of Life: Since this is the first release of Mita there are no deprecated or removed features.
Standards: Not applicable
Communities: Since the start of the project we have had increasing interest and interaction with end users in the form of bug reports and feature requests and some external contributions by pull requests.
We have an implementation for communicating with Eclipse Hono.
Bosch Connected Devices and Solutions has shipped Mita in three iterations of its XDK Workbench for their freely programmable IoT device "Cross Domain Development Kit" (XDK) so far and continues to support and use it.

How to Contribute
Report an Issue
In case you find a bug or have a feature request, feel free to file an issue here on GitHub. If the issue already exists, you can also up-vote it. When creating a new issue, you can set labels for easier categorization like bug, enhancement etc. Priority labels are usually set by the project leads.
Extend Mita
There are two ways you can extend Mita:
Provide or extend a Mita platform: to run Mita on a particular device, we need a platform which describes this device. For details of how to build such a platform, check out our platform integrator guide (TBD).
Extend the core language itself: Mita is a programming language in its infancy. If you want to help build it, please find and file bug reports, or better yet provide a PR to fix it.

Eclipse Mita is a new programming language for the embedded IoT.
It targets developers who are new to embedded software development, specifically those who come from a cloud background.
As a developer Mita feels like a modern programming language (in the vein of TypeScript), but translates to C code which compiles to native code running directly on the embedded hardware.
Combining declarative configuration, powerful language features with code generation enables projects to scale their deployment over quantity - from the first prototype to shipping thousands of devices.
Getting started
Mita serves two separate user groups: IoT developers and device vendors/platform integrators.

Eclipse Mita Creation Review
Type: CreationState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, March 7, 2018Project: Eclipse MitaProposal:
Eclipse Mita
Parent Project: Eclipse IoTBackground: The Internet of Things (IoT) revolves around the development, mass-production and deployment of wireless embedded sensor devices. This development has to reconcile competing goals. Many IoT devices are resource-constraint (e.g. in power, memory, computation), which mandates we write software on a low abstraction level (in C, working on a bare resource-level). This eases product development later-on but impedes exploration and flexibility. Developers have to care about hardware-specific details instead of focusing on sensor data and connectivity to the Cloud or other systems. Novices face a high entry barrier and are offered a complex developer experience.
Scope: Eclipse Mita aims to build a new programming language for the embedded IoT including editor/IDE, compiler and an extensive test-suite. Mita inherits the syntax of modern general-purpose system-level languages (e.g. Swift or Rust), but compiles to near-production ready C code. It offers powerful abstractions for sensor access, connectivity and general purpose IO. Centered around developer experience, it is build as a DSL using Eclipse Xtext.
The demo below gives an incling of how the language works:
Getting started as IoT developer
To get an impression of how Mita looks like for IoT developers, check out a short quick demo, or a talk from the Eclipse IoT Day 2018 in Grenoble.
As an IoT developer Mita is most useful to you if it comes integrated in a device vendors offering. See below for a list of vendors who currently offer Mita support (if your organization/offering/platform should be in this list, please raise a pull-request):
Bosch Cross Domain Development Kit (XDK110) ships Mita in its workbench
More information about the language itself can be found in our documentation.
Getting started as a device vendor/platform integrator
For Mita to run on a platform/device there is some integration work necessary. Have a look at our platform integrators guide for more details on how to enable Mita for your platform.

Why Here?: The Eclipse IoT ecosystem supports organizations and developers in building solutions on medium-power devices, to communicate between devices (Leshan, Vorto) and in the Cloud. While in the embedded and low-power space Eclipse is present with the CDT, IoT specific problems are yet to be addressed. Mita would be a step towards expanding the Eclipse IoT ecosystem into low-power, embedded solution development.
Initial Contribution: The initial code drop will follow.
Legal Issues: The current implementation uses the Yakindu State Chart Tools (EPL licensed) for its type system and expressions.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 2.0Future Work: In future work we plan to explore the language level integration with Eclipse Vorto. Further, we intend to investigate a visual programming language built on top of this work.
