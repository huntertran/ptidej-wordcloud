Eclipse Keyple is an open source framework to facilitate the implementation of terminal processing operating smart card readers, and to defined advanced secure ticketing transaction.
The Keyple Core API provides a universal interface to manage smart card readers:
The solution is able to handle any smart card reader solutions: standard (contacts/contactless PC/SC, NFC, OMAPI) or proprietary in a generic way.
It’s also compatible with any terminal architecture: local or remote, for any kind of terminals: mobile, embedded or server. Remote smart card readers could be managed as local readers in a transparent way.
The Core API can be extended with command sets of specific smart card solutions in order to define advanced secure transactions. The project hosts a first extension to support the Calypso ticketing solution.
The Keyple Calypso API provides a high-level interface to implement fast and secure contactless ticketing transactions based on the Calypso standard.
Cards & SAM commands are transmitted in an optimized grouping to limit network exchanges in case of distributed architecture.
Two implementations are currentely proposed for Java (dependency Java SE 6 and later, Android 4.4 or later) and for C++ (dependency C++ 11). Both implementations are based on the same oriented-object API.
The components of Keyple Java are:
'Keyple Core': the generic interface to manage smart card reader solutions and select secure element.
'Calypso Extension': the library to define transaction with Calypso card.
'stub plugin': a tool to emulate readers and cards to operate Keyple without hardware elemnts.
'PC/SC plugin': the library to interface PC/SC readers to the Keyple Core.
'Android NFC plugin': the library to interface the native NFC contactless readers on Android device.
'OMAPI plugin': the library to interface the OMAPI contacts readers on Android device.
'Remote SE plugin': a first prototype of plugin to operate remote readers as localy.
The components of Keyple C++ are:
The Keyple Cpp is currently limited to support of the 'Calypso Core', 'Calypso Extension', the 'stub plugin', and the ‘PC/SC plugin' (based on the same API as for Java compnents). The 'Remote SE plugin' client will be added for the version 1.0.0.
When a Keyple Java version is released, the porting of Keyple C++ is published two months later.

Removal of dependencies between components (Core, Calypso extension, and specific plugins): each component will be released with its own version and a separate life cycle.
Current solution:
The last release of Keyple Java is version 0.9.0 (https://github.com/eclipse/keyple-java). For Keyple C++, the last release is stil version 0.8.1 (https://github.com/eclipse/keyple-cpp).
Coming soon:
The C++ porting of Keyple 0.9 is in progress, a first alpha will be available during October, and the final 0.9 release in November 2020.
The version 1.0.0 of Keyple Java is planned for December 2020:
The main objectives of this version are:
a simpler and reliable Remote SE plugin solution to operate remote readers independently to the system architecture.
for the 'Keyple Core module': simplification of the Plugin API dedicated for plugin developers.
Main unsolved issue for the release 1.0.0: the versioning of the different components (Core, Calypso extension, and specific plugins) will still be linked: to manage transitive importation the artifact are build with the same version reference.
Coming next:
The version 2.0.0 will provide a better stability by supporting separate life cycle and different versioning for the Keyple components. Then the hosting of source for the different component will be split separate git repositories.

Reader Access
On Keyple, the smart card readers are managed through plugins in order to integrate specific reader solutions.
The ‘SmartCard Service’ singleton provides the unique name list of registered plugins. There can be three kinds of plugin:
The ‘Plugin’ is the generic interface to list the readers of a plugin, or to access to a specific reader with its name.
The ‘Observable Plugin’ interface extends Plugins which have the capability to be observed: in order to notify registered Plugin Observers about the plug or unplug of readers. Plugin Observers could be added or removed to the Observable Plugin. Useful for systems allowing the hot plug / unplug of Readers.
A ‘Pool Plugin’ is a plugin for which a Reader is available only after an explicit allocation. When not more necessary, a Reader must be released. Useful for server solutions managing farms of Readers or interfaced with HSM: unallocated Readers or HSM instances could be shared between several smartcard terminal solutions.
A smartcard Reader is identified through its unique name in a Plugin. There are two kinds of Reader:
The ‘Reader’ is the generic interface to handle a smartcard reader. The presence of card in a Reader could be checked.
The ‘Observable Reader’ interface extends Readers which have the capability to notify registered Reader Observers about the insertion or remove of a Card in the Reader. Reader Observers could be added or removed to the Observable Reader. Useful for systems automatically starting the processing of a Card at its insertion: like a ticketing validator.
(The APDU transmission with a Card is managed at a lower layer, through a Card Solution API.)
Specific Plugin integration
To hide Plugin native implementation classes, the Plugins are registered to the SmartCard Service through related specific Plugin Factory.
Reader Notifications
To be notified about ‘Plugin Event’ or ‘Reader Event’, a terminal application must implement the dedicated ‘Plugin Observer’ or ‘Reader Observer’ interfaces.
Plugin Event
Several ‘Plugin Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Plugin.
Keyple Java 0.8.1 to 0.9 alpha Migration Guide | keyple
Keyple Core Application API | keyple
In case of reader connection / disconnection, the Observable Plugin notifies sequentially the registered Plugin Observers with the corresponding Plugin Event.
The Observable Plugin is a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the Plugin Event waits the acknowledge of the Plugin Observer currently notified.
Reader Event
Several ‘Reader Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Reader.
In case of Card insertion / removal or selection match, the Observable Reader notifies sequentially the registered Reader Observers with the corresponding Reader Event. The Observable Reader could be a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the Plugin Event could wait the acknowledge of the notified Reader Observers.
An Observable Reader has the capability to be set with a ‘Default Selections Request’: in this case when a Card is inserted in the Reader, the Reader will try to operate the configured default selections. If a selection successfully matches with the Card, instead to simply notify about the insertion of a Card, the Observable Reader will notify about a successful selection with a Card application.
If the notification mode is defined as ‘always’, then in case of Card insertion, the Observable Reader will notify a matched card Reader Event in case of successful selection, or a simple card insertion Reader Event if not.
If the notification mode is defined as ‘matched only’, then in case of Card insertion, simple card insertion Reader Events are not notified.
When the processing of an inserted or matched Card is finished, a Reader Observer must release the logical channel with the Card, in order to prepare the Observable Reader to detect the removal of the Card.
Observable Reader states
An Observable Reader is active only when at least one Reader Observer is registered, and if the start of the detection has been requested.
When active, an Observable Reader could switch between three internal states: ‘Wait for Card Insertion’, ‘Wait for Card Processing’, & ‘Wait for Card Removal’.
In the nominal case, a Reader Observer indicates to the Observable Reader that the processing of the SE is finished by releasing the Card Channel.
To manage a failure of the Reader Observer process, the Observable Reader interface provides also a method to finalize the Card processing.
The states could be switched:
due to an explicit API request (blue arrows):
the release of the Card Channel,
the call of an Observable Reader method:
the addition or the remove of an Observable Reader,

Keyple Java 0.8.1 to 0.9 alpha Migration Guide
This guide is intended to help a user of version 0.8.1 of Keyple Java to upgrade his application to the 0.9 alpha version of the library.
From a user API point of view, the changes relate to the following topics:
plugin registration in the SeProxyService
preparation of selection cases
retrieving selection results
definition of the security settings of the transaction
creation of the PoTransaction object
transaction commands preparation
transaction commands processing
retrieving data read from POs
error handling
Plugin registration in the SeProxyService
The registerPlugin method of the SeProxyService class now returns the reference of the registered plugin.
This makes it possible, for example, to perform a reader setup in an application such as this one:
// Create a PcscPlugin and register it into the SeProxyService
ReaderPlugin pcscPlugin = seProxyService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory());`
// Get the PO reader from the plugin
SeReader poReader = pcscPlugin.getReader("ASK LoGO 0");
Preparation of selection cases
The AidSelector, Selector and PoSelector classes now follow the Fluent Builder pattern for better handling of optional parameters.
The construction of an AidSelector is as follows:
AidSelector appAidSelector = AidSelector.builder()
.aidToSelect(AID)

the insertion a Card causing the Observable Reader to notify a ‘Card matched’ Reader Event (in case of successful default selection) or a ‘Card inserted’ Reader Event (Notification Mode defined as always).
the removal of a Card causing the Observable Reader to notify a ‘Card removed’ Reader Event.
If a Card detection is started with the ‘repeating’ polling mode, then later when the Card is removed, the Reader starts again the detection of a new Card.
Whatever the Plugin of Observable Reader, when waiting for the Card removal, any Observable Reader shall have the capability to notify the remove of the Card.
Some Plugin solutions could have the capability to notify a Card removal also during the processing of the Card.
Card Selection
Selection scenarios
Depending on the Card transaction use case, or on the Reader capability, there are two ways to manage the Selection of a Card:
Either on a simple Reader, a Selection could be operated directly by transmitting the Selection Request. In this case the same entity manages both the Card Selection and the Card processing.
Otherwise, on an Observable Reader, a Default Selection could be defined. In this case the Selection is operated automatically at the insertion of the Card. In this case, the Card Selection is next managed by the Observable Reader, but the Card processing is managed by a Reader Observer.
Selection setting and processing
A Card Selection request is defined with a Card Selector. A Card Selector could be defined with tree optional levels of selection filter.
The selection could be limited to match a specific card communication protocol.
The Card ATR could be filtered to match a regular expression.
If an AID is defined, the local reader transmits a Select Application APDU command to the card.
If a SE Selector is defined without any filter, the selection is always successful if a card is present in the reader.
Depending on the Keyple Card Solution extension library, a card request could be completed with specific card commands to operate at the selection (for example, a Select File for a specific DF LID, the read of a specific file).
For terminal managing several kinds of card applications, a Card Selection could be prepared with several card selection request to operate sequentially with the card.
According to the defined ‘multi selection processing’ mode, the card selection could stop at the first selection request matching card application, otherwise all the prepared card selection request could be operated.
Before the new processing of card selection request, the logical channel previously opened is closed.

Calypso Portable Object Selection
Compared to the generic SE Selection API (cf. https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple/KeypleCoreApi/ApplicationApi/#se-selection), a PO Selector could be defined to accept only non-invalidated Portable Object (in this cas an invalidated PO isn’t selected).
In addition, a PO Selection Request provides methods:
.fileControlInformation(AidSelector.FileControlInformation.FCI)
.fileOccurrence(AidSelector.FileOccurrence.FIRST)
.build();
The fileControlInformation and fileOccurrence fields are optional (shown here with their default values), so a simple version can be :
AidSelector aidSelector = AidSelector.builder().aidToSelect(CalypsoClassicInfo.AID).build();
The construction of a SeSelector is as follows:
seSelector = SeSelector.builder()
.seProtocol(SeCommonProtocols.PROTOCOL_ISO14443_4)
.aidSelector(appAidSelector)
.build();
The PoSelector adds the possibility to specify that an invalidated PO should be processed
seSelector = SeSelector.builder()
.seProtocol(SeCommonProtocols.PROTOCOL_ISO14443_4)
.aidSelector(appAidSelector)
.invalidatedPo(InvalidatedPo.ACCEPT)
.build();
The management of PO commands to be performed after the selection step (when it has been successful) is handled by the methods of the PoSelectionRequest class:
preparing to read files has been simplified and is done using the unique following method:
public void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int recordNumber)
preparing to select files is done using the following method:
public void prepareSelectFile(byte[] lid)
public void prepareSelectFile(short lid)
Note that from now the “prepare” methods no longer return indexes, the data will be placed in the CalypsoPo object.
Reader event
Several ‘Reader Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Reader.
In case of SE insertion / match / removal, the observable reader notifies sequentially the registered observers with the corresponding reader event. The observable reader could be a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the plugin event could wait the acknowledge of the notified observers.
An observable reader has the capability to be set with a ‘Default Selections Request’: in this case when a SE is inserted in the reader, the reader will try to operate the configured default selections. If a selection successfully matches with the SE, instead to simply notify the insertion of SE, the observable reader will notify about a successful selection with a SE application.
If the notification mode is defined as ‘always’, then in case of SE insertion, the observable reader will notify a SE matched reader event in case of successful selection, or a simple SE inserted reader event if not.
If the notification mode is defined as ‘matched only’, then in case of SE insertion, simple SE inserted reader events are not notified.
When the processing of an inserted or matched SE is finished, a reader observer must release the logical channel with the Secure Element, in order to prepare the observable reader to detect the removal of the SE.
Observable reader states
An observable reader is active only when at least one reader observer is registered, and if the start of the detection has been requested.
When active, an observable read could switch between three internal states: ‘Wait for SE Insertion’, ‘Wait for SE Processing’, & ‘Wait for SE Removal’.
In the nominal case, a Reader Observer indicates to the observable reader that the processing of the SE is finished by releasing the SE Channel.
To manage a failure of the reader observer process, the observable reader interface provides also a method to finalize the SE processing.
The states could be switched:
due to an explicit API request (blue arrows):
the release of the Secure Element Channel,
the call of an Observable Reader method:
the addition or the remove of an Observable Reader,
a request to start or stop the detection, to finalize the SE processing.
Or because of an external event (red arrows), the insertion or the remove of a SE.
the insertion a SE causing the observable reader to notify a ‘SE matched’ reader event (in case of successful
l default selection) or a ‘SE inserted’ reader event (Notification Mode defined as always).
the removal of a SE causing the observable reader to notify a ‘SE removed’ reader event.
If a SE detection is started with the ‘repeating’ polling mode, then later when the SE is removed, the reader starts again to detect a SE.
The ‘channel control’ defines if the logical channel should be kept open or close after the last processed card selection request.
The result of a card request selection is a card image of a matching card. For a card selection with multiple requests, several matching card could be provided.

to prepare Select File command (useful in particular to manage REV1 Calypso PO for which the select of the targeted DF is required).
and to prepare simple read record command (useful to optimize the read of a file present on all targeted PO).
The matching SE resulting from a PO Selection Request is a Calypso PO. In case file records have been read during the selection: the corresponding data could be recovered in the Calypso PO card image.
Calypso Portable Object Transaction
A Secure Element resource (SeResource) is a set of a smart card reader and a selected secure element application.
A Calypso Portable Object (CalypsoPo) is the image of a selected Calypso PO.
A Calypso SAM (CalypsoSam) is the image of a selected Calypso SAM.
To operate a Calypso transaction:
At least a Calypso resource (SeResource) is required.
A SAM resource ((SeResource) is required too if security features are involved (Calypso secure session, Stored value transaction, PIN encryption, etc…).
A Calypso PO image provides public ‘getters’ in order to recover the information of the selected PO (startup data, file data, … etc).
A transaction with a Calypso PO is fully managed through the PoTransaction object:
First a set of PO commands could be defined through ‘prepare’ commands.
Next the prepared PO commands transmitted when operating a ‘process’ command.
The responses of the PO are then recovered through the Calypso PO image.
Calypso card image
Calypso transaction
Most of the process methods have a ‘Channel Control’ parameter in order to define if the logical with the selected Calypso has to be kept open or to be closed after the processing of the prepared PO commands.
processPoCommands is used to transmit a set of prepared PO commands outside of a secure session.
processOpening issues an Open Secure Session followed by the prepared PO commands.
processPoCommandsInSession allows to transmit a set of prepared PO commands inside of a secure session.
processClosing issues first the last prepared PO commands and transmits a Close Secure Session.
prepareManageSession allows to change authenticate or change the encryption mode.
Retrieving selection results
The MatchingSelection class no longer exists.
In the class SelectionsResult (see processDefaultSelection/processExplicitSelection):
getActiveSelection is replaced by getActiveMatchingSe which returns an AbstractMatchingSe object (the still existing hasActiveSelection method must be used before)
getMatchingSelection is replaced by getMatchingSe which returns an AbstractMatchingSe object (may be null if the index provided does not correspond to a successful selection case)
getMatchingSelections now returns a Map containing a list of associated AbstractMatchingSe with the selection index that produced it (Map<Integer, AbstractMatchingSe>)
a new hasSelectionMatched method indicates whether the selection index provided corresponds to a successful selection case
a new getActiveSelectionIndex method returns the index of the active selection (the still existing hasActiveSelection method must be used before)
Definition of the security settings of the transaction
These parameters are defined via the PoSecuritySettings class, whose construction now follows the Fluent Builder pattern.
All parameters are optional except the SamResource.
Here is an example of a complete PoSecuritySettings build:
poSecuritySettings = new PoSecuritySettings.PoSecuritySettingsBuilder(samResource)
.sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_PERSO, DEFAULT_KIF_PERSO)
.sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_LOAD, DEFAULT_KIF_LOAD)
.sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT, DEFAULT_KIF_DEBIT)
.sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_PERSO, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_PERSO)
.sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_LOAD, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_LOAD)
.sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_DEBIT)
.sessionModificationMode(ModificationMode.ATOMIC)
.ratificationMode(RatificationMode.CLOSE_RATIFIED)
.sessionAuthorizedKvcList(authKvcs)
.build();
Whatever the plugin of observable reader, when waiting for the SE removal, any observable reader shall have the capability to notify the remove of the SE.
Some reader plugin solution could have the capability to notify a SE removal also during the processing of the SE.
SE Selection
Selection scenarios
Depending on the SE transaction use case, or on the reader capability, there are two ways to manage the selection of a SE:
Either on a SE reader, a selection could be operated directly by transmitting the selection request. In this case the same entity manages both the SE selection and the SE processing.
Otherwise, on an Observable Reader, a default selection could be defined. In this case the selection is operated automatically at the insertion of the SE. In this case, the SE selection is next managed by the observable reader, but the SE processing is managed by a reader observer.
Selection setting and processing
A SE Selection request is defined with a SE Selector. A SE Selector could be defined with tree optional levels of selection filter.
The selection could be limited to match a specific SE communication protocol.
The SE ATR could be filtered to match a regular expression.
If an AID is defined, the local reader transmits a Select Application APDU command to the SE.
If a SE Selector is defined without any filter, the selection is always successful if a SE is present in the reader.
Depending on the Keyple SE extension library, a SE request could be completed with specific SE commands to operate at the selection (for example, a Select File for a specific DF LID, the read of a specific file).
For terminal managing several kinds of SE applications, a SE Selection could be prepared with several SE selection request to operate sequentially with the SE.
According to the defined ‘multi SE request processing’ mode, the SE selection could stop at the first selection request matching SE application, otherwise all the prepared SE selection request could be operated.
Before the new processing of SE selection request, the logical channel previously opened is closed.
The ‘channel control’ defines if the logical channel should be kept open or close after the last processed SE selection request.
The result of a SE request selection is a card image of a matching SE. For a SE selection with multiple requests, several matching SE could be provided.

Creation of the PoTransaction object
Since PoSecuritySettings now integrates SamResource, the construction of PoTransaction has evolved slightly.
Here is an example:
PoTransaction poTransaction = new PoTransaction(new PoResource(poReader, calypsoPo), poSecuritySettings);
Transaction commands preparation
Just as with the “prepare” commands used for selection, the “prepare” commands used for transactions no longer return indexes.
The available commands in version 0.9 are:
public final void prepareSelectFile(SelectFileControl control)
public final void prepareSelectFile(short lid)
public final void prepareSelectFile(byte[] lid)
public final void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int recordNumber)
public final void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int firstRecordNumber, int numberOfRecords, int recordSize))
public final void prepareReadCounterFile(byte sfi, int countersNumber)
public final void prepareUpdateRecord(byte sfi, int recordNumber, byte[] recordData)
public final void prepareWriteRecord(byte sfi, int recordNumber, byte[] recordData)
public final void prepareAppendRecord(byte sfi, byte[] recordData)
public final void prepareIncreaseCounter(byte sfi, int counterNumber, int incValue)
public final void prepareDecreaseCounter(byte sfi, int counterNumber, int decValue)
Transaction commands processing
The “process” commands have also been revised and simplified.
They all return void.
In case of failure a exception is raised (see below).
public final void processOpening(PoTransaction.SessionSetting.AccessLevel accessLevel)
The ModificationMode is no longer required since it is integrated in the PoSecuritySettings.
Parameters previously used to specify that a file is read at login are removed.
Instead, the first prepareReadFile command will be automatically taken into account.
public final void processPoCommands()
public final void processPoCommandsInSession()
public final void processCancel(ChannelControl channelControl)
public final void processClosing(ChannelControl channelControl)
Retrieving data read from POs
This is a major evolution of the Keyple API. Previously, data read from Calyspo POs were retrieved by applications using “parser” methods.
With Keyple API 0.9, Calypso PO data is made available in the CalypsoPo object obtained during selection and enriched all along the operations performed with PoTransaction.
The public getter methods of CalypsoPo are:
public final String getDfName()
public final byte[] getDfNameBytes()
public final String getApplicationSerialNumber()
public final byte[] getApplicationSerialNumberBytes()
public final String getAtr()
public final String getStartupInfo()
public final PoRevision getRevision()
public final byte getSessionModification()
public final byte getApplicationType()
public final byte getApplicationSubtype()
public final byte getPlatform()
public final byte getSoftwareIssuer()
public final byte getSoftwareVersion()
public final byte getSoftwareRevision()
public final boolean isDeselectRatificationSupported()
public final boolean isConfidentialSessionModeSupported()
public final boolean isPublicAuthenticationSupported()
public final boolean isPinFeatureAvailable()
public final boolean isSvFeatureAvailable()
public final boolean isDfInvalidated()
public final boolean isDfRatified()
public final DirectoryHeader getDirectoryHeader()
public final ElementaryFile getFileBySfi(byte sfi)
public final ElementaryFile getFileByLid(short lid)
public final Map<Byte, ElementaryFile> getAllFiles()
Four new classes DirectoryHeader, ElementaryFile, FileHeader and FileData have been added.
DirectoryHeader
The public getters for this class are:
public short getLid()
public byte[] getAccessConditions()
public byte[] getKeyIndexes()

So, for example to extract the contents of contract files present in the PO, the code might look like this:
[...]
/* Read all 4 contracts command, record size set to 29 */
poTransaction.prepareReadRecordFile(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_Contracts,
CalypsoClassicInfo.RECORD_NUMBER_1, 4, 29);
/* proceed with the sending of commands, don't close the channel */
poTransaction.processPoCommandsInSession();
ElementaryFile efContracts = calypsoPo.getFileBySfi(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_Contracts);
SortedMap<Integer, byte[]> records = efContracts.getData().getAllRecordsContent();
for (Map.Entry<Integer, byte[]> entry : records.entrySet()) {
ByteArrayUtil.toHex(entry.getValue()));
}
[...]
Error handling
Since version 0.9, all Keyple exceptions are of the RuntimeException type.
Catching exceptions is therefore now optional.
However, it is possible to selectively catch certain exceptions in order to deal with particular cases.
The new hierarchy of Keyple exceptions is shown here

'Eclipse Keyple' Java implementation
Sign in to GitHub · GitHub
This is the repository for the Java implementation of the 'Eclipse Keyple' API. Information & guides are available on keyple.org.
(The C++ implementation is hosted on https://github.com/eclipse/keyple-cpp.)

Global Architecture of Keyple
The API is currently divided in two major layers:
The ‘Keyple Core' : a Secure Element Proxy API which allows managing SE readers in a generic way, whaterver the reader driver or environment, and for standalone or distributed solution.
A ‘Calypso Keyple extension' : a high level Calypso Processing API allowing to operate commands with a Calypso Portable Object, and to manage a secure Calypso transaction.
Dedicated reader’s plugins have to be implemented in order to interface the SE Proxy API with the specific reader’s drivers.
API guides for the Keyple Core and Keyple Calypso are available on keyple.org.
For a distributed architecture, the Remote SE Plugin should be used (Keyple Remote SE User Guide). In version 0.9 the SE Plugin is still proposed as a draft, a simpler API will be provided in the version 1.0 alpha 1 in October 2020.
Supported platforms
Java SE 1.6 compact2
Android 4.4 KitKat API level 19

keyple-java repositories structure
Modules that are provided as artifacts
keyple-core: source and unit tests for the SE Proxy module (artifact : keyple-java-core)
keyple-calypso: source and unit tests for the Calypso library (artifact : keyple-java-calypso)
keyple-plugin: source and unit tests for the different plugins: smartcard.io PC/SC, Stub, Android NFC, Android OMAPI, etc.
developer support, testing
example: source for Keyple implementation examples, generic or Calypso specific.
Keyple Core - features / packages and corresponding usages
The Keyple Core is the basic component of Keyple to handle secure element reader and to operate generic processing with Secure Elements. On Keyple, secure element readers are interfaced through specific reader plugins.
The Core is divided in 3 sub-modules:
Reader: includes the API to access and manage a SE reader.
Plugin: provides factorized processing for the implementation of reader plugin.
SE: the generic operation for Secure Element.
(Starting from the version 1.0 of Keyple Core, the sub-modules will be provided in different artifacts with their own versioning).
According to the developer’s objective different API must be imported:
for the implementation of a secure element terminal application, only the high-level API of the ‘reader’ and ‘SE’ modules.
to implement a plugin, all the ‘reader’ API and the low-level ‘plugin’ API.
to develop a dedicated library supporting the command sets and transaction features of a specific secure element solution, the low-level ‘reader’ and ‘SE’ API.

Cloning this project
Examples provided in this project relies on symbolic links to handle their common dependencies. (Please refer to this file for more information).
Although symlink support should be provided out of the box for Unix users, Windows users should be aware that the git option core.symlinks needs to be enabled before cloning this repo. Several solutions can be considered:
When installing git for Windows, an option Enable symbolic links can be choosen. If it has not been enabled and you want to set it via the installer, a reinstallation is needed
If you do not want to reinstall git, this option can be enabled afterward via the command line git config core.symlinks true
Also, the option can be enabled once only for this specific cloning operation with git clone -c core.symlinks=true REPO_URL

repositories {
//to import releases
//to import snapshots
}
dependencies {
//Keyple core is a mandatory library for using Keyple, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-core
implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-core', version: '0.8.1'
//Import Calypso library to support Calypso Portable Object, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-calypso
implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-calypso', version: '0.8.1'
//Import PCSC library to use a Pcsc reader, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-plugin-pcsc
implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-plugin-pcsc', version: '0.8.1'
...
}

Eclipse Keyple | projects.eclipse.org
Transaction API: management of an explicit application selection on a reader; setting of a default selection operation on an observed reader
Known issues/limits
Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits
the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.
Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7
Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
Known issues/limits
PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.7
Reader plugin emulator: allows to define virtual readers to operate the SE Proxy API without native readers.

The main evolutions concern the Core module:
To avoid misuse of plugins, now plugins have to be registered to the SE Proxy using plugin factories.
For observable readers, the sequence to detect an SE insertion, wait for its processing and for its removal has been fixed too.
All the plugins have been updated to take into account the factory setting and the SE status notifications.

The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits
the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.
Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7
Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
Known issues/limits
PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.7
Reader plugin emulator: allows to define virtual readers to operate the SE Proxy API without native readers.
Known issues/limits:
StubPlugin has a public visibility.
Some tests have a dependency with the Calypso library.
keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.7
Plugin to communicate remotely with a Secure Element; definition of MasterAPI and SlaveAPI to enable Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between Keyple virtual reader terminals and Keyple native reader terminals. MasterAPI manages virtual reader that acts as a proxy to the remote reader.
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.8

Global Architecture of Keyple
The API is currently divided in two major layers:
The ‘Keyple Core' : a Secure Element Proxy API which allows managing SE readers in a generic way, whaterver the reader driver or environment, and for standalone or distributed solution (Keyple Core User Guide).
A ‘Calypso Keyple extension' : a high level Calypso Processing API allowing to operate commands with a Calypso Portable Object, and to manage a secure Calypso transaction (Keyple Calypso User Guide).
Dedicated reader’s plugins have to be implemented in order to interface the SE Proxy API with the specific reader’s drivers.
Supported platforms
Windows / Linux / MacOS
G++ 6 and higher, MSVC++ 14 (other compilers untested)

Getting started
Cloning this project
Examples provided in this project relies on symbolic links to handle their common dependencies. (Please refer to this file for more information).
Although symlink support should be provided out of the box for Unix users, Windows users should be aware that the git option core.symlinks needs to be enabled before cloning this repo. Several solutions can be considered:
When installing git for Windows, an option Enable symbolic links can be choosen. If it has not been enabled and you want to set it via the installer, a reinstallation is needed
If you do not want to reinstall git, this option can be enabled afterward via the command line git config core.symlinks true
Also, the option can be enabled once only for this specific cloning operation with git clone -c core.symlinks=true REPO_URL
It is important to note that for this option to be actually working, the Windows user needs to have the SeCreateSymbolicLink permission: a user with admin rights is typically granted with this permission.

a simplified Calypso API to recover the APDU responses' data by using a card image,
the addition of the Calypso features Stored Value transaction and PIN verification, the support Invalidate/Rehabilitate PO commands, and the Unlock SAM command.
for the 'Keyple Core module':
a clearer public plugin API that better hides internal processing for developers of applications involving readers.
an improvement of the API to manage the release of the communication channel with Secure Element, with a consistent behavior regardless the type of reader (observed or not).
for the 'NFC & OMAPI Android plugins':
the new implementations in Kotlin are now optimized for all Android version from Kit Kat 4.4

Primary tabsOverview
Issues
Release Plan
Review Information(active tab)
Description: Release train of the Eclipse Keyple java implementation:
keyple-java-core 0.8
keyple-java-calypso 0.8
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.8
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.8
keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.8
keyple-android-plugin-nfc 0.8
keyple-android-plugin-omapi 0.8
The main evolutions concern the Core module:
To avoid misuse of plugins, now plugins have to be registered to the SE Proxy using plugin factories.
For observable readers, the sequence to detect an SE insertion, wait for its processing and for its removal has been fixed too.
All the plugins have been updated to take into account the factory setting and the SE status notifications.
Security Issues: None
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verified

0.7.0 (Java 19/07) | projects.eclipse.org
Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits
the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.
Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7
Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
Known issues/limits
PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.7
Reader plugin emulator: allows to define virtual readers to operate the SE Proxy API without native readers.
Known issues/limits:
StubPlugin has a public visibility.
Some tests have a dependency with the Calypso library.
keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.7
Plugin to communicate remotely with a Secure Element; definition of MasterAPI and SlaveAPI to enable Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between Keyple virtual reader terminals and Keyple native reader terminals. MasterAPI manages virtual reader that acts as a proxy to the remote reader.
Known limits in 0.7.0

Eclipse Keyple
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse IoT
Background: Calypso is a set of specifications describing a fast and secure off-line contactless transaction, between a portable object and a terminal. It has been created at the end of the 1990s by some european public transport operators or authority (RATP and SNCF in Paris and all France, STIB in Brussels, OTLIS in Lisbon, ACTV in Venice, Konstanz in Germany), in order to create an open , interoperable and secure standard independent from industrials to ensure a real competition.
Today Calypso represent 20% of the world market of contactless smart ticketing in 25 countries and 125 cities. It brings to his user a guarantee of security and interoperability which relies on a total compliance with existing standards (ISO 14443, ISO 7816-4, Global Platform). The Calypso standard is managed by the Calypso Networks Association (CNA) , which is led by transports operators and public authorities in order to ensure openness and independence from industrials in confront of other proprietary schemes.
The openness for a contactless ticketing standard can be evaluated for the two mains components of ticketing systems, with the complementary concern about guarantee of security:
Cards and portable objects (mobile phones, Java objects, wearables, …)
Terminals (validators, vending equipment, …)
We can affirm that a real openness is achieved for cards and portable objects with the Calypso standard with a large choice of products and providers (card manufacturer, OS makers and chip providers) and a real competition between them.
However, for ticketing equipment the situation is more contrasted. In fact, if the Calypso specifications are open, the terminal applications operating ticketing data (contracts, pricing, user profile) which have to be implemented on top of a smartcard management layer are proprietary of a few ticketing integrator/manufacturer, and the networks who used this solutions may only manage evolutions in a “purchase by agreement” manner, with a direct impact on the price.
Furthermore, other mobility actors (Car sharing, bike sharing…) that would like to be integrated in the mobility ecosystem led by public transport operator would like to benefit of the highly secured Calypso transaction “as a service”, and consequently be ready for global integration without being ”killed” by complexity and security issues that would oblige them to make too big investments.
In fact, from the very beginning, the scope of Calypso Networks Association is to promote the open standard Calypso which has been originally designed for Interoperability in transportation. Nowadays, we are more talking about Mobility, including very different and new modes, and “traditional transport operators are facing commercial and technical issues about providing a door to door seamless travel to their customer. Consequently, Calypso Networks Association, leaded by Public Transport operators, decided to develop and publish an Open Source SDK that could fit with any type of terminal and contactless reader architecture in order to facilitate and spread the adoption of the calypso standard. Thus new mobility actors, transport operators, Local authority will be able to focus on the travelers expectations, commercial agreements and new mobility programs development without losing time on technical issues or allowing smooth evolution of their systems.
Scope: Eclipse Keyple provides generic librairies for simplifying the development of contactless applications based on the Calypso standard, and for facilitating integration with the secure elements typically involved in a secure contactless solution. Those librairies will also be compliant with the other existing standards af the market.
Description: The goal of Eclipse Keyple is to allow developers to easily implement fast and secure off-line contactless transactions (using NFC cards, mobile phones, …) based on the Calypso standard.
More specifically, Keyple is a set of open source libraries that will initially be available in Java and C++, designed on the same mutual Object-Oriented Model compatible with any terminal architecture: mobile, embedded or server and Interoperable with any smart card reader solution: standard or proprietary, local or remote.
It manages the advanced security features of Calypso but is also able to manage non-Calypso smartcard solutions, for ticketing or payment.
Keyple defines two layers:
Ticketing applications relies on a high-level Calypso processing API to manage Calypso commands & security features. For a session with a Portable Object: SAM commands can be automatically generated and sent to the SAM reader or HSM.
Secure Element (SE) readers are integrated through plugins implementing the SE Proxy API which manages the communications with a contactless secure element through ant type of contactless reader (local, remote, standard, proprietary…)
Keyple propose a Local and Remote Secure Element optimization:
Cards or SAM’s commands are grouped to limit network exchanges for mobile, embedded terminal or server solution.
Keyple can be used with Standard or Proprietary SE reader driver:
It will be packaged with plugins to manage standard Secure Element interfaces: Android NFC Reader, Android SmartCard interface, Windows/Linux PC/SC, Java SmartCard IO PC/SC interface.
Keyple can also be extended with plugins implementation to manage proprietary drivers that could be proposed by smartcard reader manufacturers.
Thanks to its modular architecture, Keyple can be used also to communicate with non Calypso contactless portable objects, using the SE Proxy API.
More informations can be found on our website : https://keyple.org/
Why Here?: Eclipse Keyple will open and spread contactless ticketing technology to everyone (today it is in the hand of few big players…)
It will enlarge the scope of the Eclipse IOT WorkGroup to the Contactless (NFC) technology, and it could enrich the Eclipse SENSINACT project as Public Transport is a key subject for smart city ecosystems.
Licenses: Eclipse Distribution License 1.0 (BSD)Eclipse Public License 2.0Legal Issues: All the code of the initial contribution is owned by Calypso Networks Association.
The Keyple Brand is also owned by Calypso Networks Association which will transfer its propriety to the Eclipse Fondation.
The main part of the code will be licensed only under EPL2. The BSD License will be added only for the build scripts.
Project Scheduling: The Java implementation will be formally released in July as part of the initial contribution.
The C++ part and the SE remote will be released later in Q3 2018.
Future Work: We plan to offer before the end of the year a more complete Calypso processing module that will implement all additional and optional features of the last Calypso version.
We will also provide a C version of Keyple for very low memory terminals.

Source Code
Initial Contribution: The different components of the Java implementation of the Keyple project
the 'keyple-core' module: it’s the main library which allows to manage in a generic way any kind of smartcard reader
the 'keyple-calypso' module: it’s an extension library which provides the support de define commands and secure transaction specific to the Calypso ticketing solution
the 'keyple-plugin-android-nfc' module: an extension dedicated to the android environment which allows to connect the NFC reader of an Android device to the Keyple SE API.
the 'keyple-plugin-android-omapi' module: an extension dedicated to the android environment which allows to connect contacts smartcard readers of an Android device (SIM / embedded Secure Element) to the Keyple SE API.
the 'keyple-plugin-pcsc' module: an extension dedicated to PC running a standard JRE with the SmardCardIO API, which allows to connect any PC/SC readers to the Keyple SE API.
the 'keyple-plugin-stub' module: an extension used to define a fake configuration, to allow to connect to the Keyple SE API different emulations of specific smart cards.
the 'keyple-example' module: some demo applications involving all the other components of the Keyple Java to illustrate the usage of the API.
All the components are based on the API of the Java Runtime Environment Standard Edition version 6: the OpenJDK is based on the ‘GNU General Public License’ in version 2.
The two Android components use in addition some API specific Android environment: the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is based on the ‘Apache Software License’ in Version 2.0.
The OMAPI plugin imports also API of the SEEK for Android project (https://github.com/seek-for-android/ ) based on the ‘Apache Software License’ in Version 2.0.
Unit tests & logging involve
the Junit API distributed under the Eclipse Public License v2.0 (https://junit.org & https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/ ),
the SLF4J API (Simple Logging Facade for Java) distributed under the ‘MIT License’ (https://www.slf4j.org & https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j ),
the structolg4j API (Structured logging for Java) distributed under the ‘MIT License’ (https://github.com/jacek99/structlog4j ),
the Mokito API distributed under the ‘MIT License’ (http://site.mockito.org/ & https://github.com/mockito/mockito.github.io ).
The project uses also the Apache Commons API based on the ‘Apache Software License’ in Version 2.0.

to prepare Select File command (useful in particular to manage REV1 Calypso PO for which the select of the targeted DF is required).
and to prepare simple read record command (useful to optimize the read of a file present on all targeted PO).
The matching SmartCard resulting from a PO Selection Request is a Calypso PO. In case file records have been read during the selection: the corresponding data could be recovered in the Calypso PO card image.
Calypso Portable Object Transaction
A Card Resource is a set of a Reader and a selected Card application.
A Calypso Portable Object is the image of a selected Calypso PO.
A Calypso SAM is the image of a selected Calypso SAM.
To operate a Calypso transaction:
At least a Calypso Resource (CardResource) is required.
A SAM Resource ((CardResource) is required too if security features are involved (Calypso secure session, Stored value transaction, PIN encryption, etc…).
A Calypso PO image provides public ‘getters’ in order to recover the information of the selected PO (startup data, file data, … etc).
A transaction with a Calypso PO is fully managed through the PoTransaction object:
First a set of PO commands could be defined through ‘prepare’ commands.
Next the prepared PO commands transmitted when operating a ‘process’ command.
The responses of the PO are then recovered through the Calypso PO image.
Calypso card image
Calypso transaction
Most of the process methods have a ‘Channel Control’ parameter in order to define if the logical with the selected Calypso has to be kept open or to be closed after the processing of the prepared PO commands.
processPoCommands is used to transmit a set of prepared PO commands outside of a secure session.
processOpening issues an Open Secure Session followed by the prepared PO commands.
processPoCommandsInSession allows to transmit a set of prepared PO commands inside of a secure session.
processClosing issues first the last prepared PO commands and transmits a Close Secure Session.
prepareManageSession allows to change authenticate or change the encryption mode.

Keyple Core - ‘Plugin API’: for the implementation of smartcard reader plugins | keyple
keyple
Keyple Core - ‘Plugin API’: for the implementation of smartcard reader plugins
version 1.0.0
Plugin Factorized Processing
The implementation of Plugins requires to extend the classes AbstractPlugin (or AbstractThreadedObservablePlugin is the reader solution allows the hot plug/unplug of readers) and AbstractLocalReader (or AbstractObservableLocalReader if the reader has the capability to detect the insertion or the removal or a card)..
Only the abstract methods indicated in blue have to be implemented have to be implemented by the specific plugins.
For plugins with ObservableReader: depending on the capability of the reader solution different interfaces could be implemented:
SmartInsertionReader if the reader solution directly manages the card insertion listening,
NativeInsertionReader in case the reader solution is notified by the operating system in case of card insertion,
SmartRemovalReader for reader solutions which have the capability to detect the card removal without sending APDU commands.
