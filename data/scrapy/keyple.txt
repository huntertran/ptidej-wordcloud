Eclipse Keyple
is an open source framework to facilitate the implementation of terminal processing operating smart card readers, and to defined advanced secure ticketing transaction.
The
Keyple Core
API provides a
universal interface to manage smart card readers
:
The solution is able to handle
any
smart card
reader solutions
:
standard
(contacts/contactless PC/SC, NFC, OMAPI) or
proprietary
in a generic way.
It’s also compatible with
any terminal architecture: local or remote
, for any kind of terminals: mobile, embedded or server. Remote smart card readers could be managed as local readers in a transparent way.
The Core API can be extended with command sets of specific smart card solutions in order to define advanced secure transactions. The project hosts a first extension to support the Calypso ticketing solution.
The
Keyple Calypso
API provides a
high-level interface to implement
fast and secure contactless ticketing transactions based on the
Calypso standard
.
Cards & SAM commands are transmitted in an optimized grouping to limit network exchanges in case of distributed architecture.
Two implementations
are currentely proposed for
Java
(dependency Java SE 6 and later, Android 4.4 or later) and for
C++
(dependency C++ 11). Both implementations are based on the
same oriented-object API
.
The components of Keyple Java are:
'Keyple
Core
': the generic interface to manage smart card reader solutions and select secure element.
'
Calypso
Extension': the library to define transaction with Calypso card.
'stub plugin': a tool to emulate readers and cards to operate Keyple without hardware elemnts.
'
PC/SC
plugin': the library to interface PC/SC readers to the Keyple Core.
'
Android NFC
plugin': the library to interface the native NFC contactless readers on Android device.
'
OMAPI
plugin': the library to interface the OMAPI contacts readers on Android device.
'Remote SE plugin': a first prototype of plugin to operate remote readers as localy.
The components of Keyple C++ are:
The Keyple Cpp is currently limited to support of the 'Calypso Core', 'Calypso Extension', the 'stub plugin', and the ‘PC/SC plugin' (based on the same API as for Java compnents). The 'Remote SE plugin' client will be added for the version 1.0.0.
When a Keyple Java version is released, the porting of Keyple C++ is published two months later.

Plugin Factorized Processing
The implementation of Plugins requires to extend the classes AbstractPlugin (or AbstractThreadedObservablePlugin is the reader solution allows the hot plug/unplug of readers) and AbstractLocalReader (or AbstractObservableLocalReader if the reader has the capability to detect the insertion or the removal or a card).. Only the abstract methods indicated in blue have to be implemented have to be implemented by the specific plugins.
For plugins with ObservableReader: depending on the capability of the reader solution different interfaces could be implemented:

Keyple Calypso Application API
version 0.9 (current ‘develop’ branch)
Calypso Portable Object Selection
Compared to the generic SE Selection API (cf. https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple/KeypleCoreApi/ApplicationApi/#se-selection), a PO Selector could be defined to accept only non-invalidated Portable Object (in this cas an invalidated PO isn’t selected).
In addition, a PO Selection Request provides methods:
’ interfaces.
Plugin Event
Several ‘Plugin Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Plugin. In case of reader connection / disconnection, the Observable Plugin notifies sequentially the registered Plugin Observers with the corresponding Plugin Event. The Observable Plugin is a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the Plugin Event waits the acknowledge of the Plugin Observer currently notified.
Reader Event
Several ‘Reader Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Reader. In case of Card insertion / removal or selection match, the Observable Reader notifies sequentially the registered Reader Observers with the corresponding Reader Event. The Observable Reader could be a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the Plugin Event could wait the acknowledge of the notified Reader Observers.
An Observable Reader has the capability to be set with a ‘Default Selections Request’: in this case when a Card is inserted in the Reader, the Reader will try to operate the configured default selections. If a selection successfully matches with the Card, instead to simply notify about the insertion of a Card, the Observable Reader will notify about a successful selection with a Card application.
If the notification mode is defined as ‘always’, then in case of Card insertion, the Observable Reader will notify a matched card Reader Event in case of successful selection, or a simple card insertion Reader Event if not.
If the notification mode is defined as ‘matched only’, then in case of Card insertion, simple card insertion Reader Events are not notified.
When the processing of an inserted or matched Card is finished, a Reader Observer must release the logical channel with the Card, in order to prepare the Observable Reader to detect the removal of the Card.
Observable Reader states
An Observable Reader is active only when at least one Reader Observer is registered, and if the start of the detection has been requested. When active, an Observable Reader could switch between three internal states: ‘Wait for Card Insertion’, ‘Wait for Card Processing’, & ‘Wait for Card Removal’.
In the nominal case, a Reader Observer indicates to the Observable Reader that the processing of the SE is finished by releasing the Card Channel. To manage a failure of the Reader Observer process, the Observable Reader interface provides also a method to finalize the Card processing.
The states could be switched:

This makes it possible, for example, to perform a reader setup in an application such as this one:

’ interface extends SE readers which have the capability to notify registered Reader Observers about the insertion or remove of a Secure Element in the reader. Reader observers could be added or removed to the observable reader. Useful for systems automatically starting the processing of a SE at its insertion: like a ticketing validator.
(The APDU transmission with a Secure Element is managed at the low-level SE Channel API.)
Specific Plugin
To hide plugin native implementation classes, the reader plugins are registered to the SE Proxy Service through related specific plugin factory.
Reader Notifications
To be notified about ‘
Plugin Event
’ or ‘
Reader Event
’, a terminal application must implement the dedicated ‘
Plugin Observer
’ or ‘
Reader Observer
’ interfaces.
Plugin event
Several ‘Plugin Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Plugin. In case of reader connection / disconnection, the observable plugin notifies sequentially the registered observers with the corresponding plugin event. The observable plugin is a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the plugin event waits the acknowledge of the observer currently notified.

to prepare Select File command (useful in particular to manage REV1 Calypso PO for which the select of the targeted DF is required).
and to prepare simple read record command (useful to optimize the read of a file present on all targeted PO).
The matching SE resulting from a PO Selection Request is a Calypso PO. In case file records have been read during the selection: the corresponding data could be recovered in the Calypso PO card image.
Calypso Portable Object Transaction
A Secure Element resource (SeResource) is a set of a smart card reader and a
selected
secure element application.
A Calypso Portable Object (CalypsoPo) is the image of a selected Calypso PO.
A Calypso SAM (CalypsoSam) is the image of a selected Calypso SAM.
To operate a Calypso transaction:
At least a Calypso resource (SeResource
) is required.
A SAM resource ((SeResource
) is required too if security features are involved (Calypso secure session, Stored value transaction, PIN encryption, etc…).
A Calypso PO image provides public ‘getters’ in order to

the removal of a Card causing the Observable Reader to notify a ‘Card removed’ Reader Event.
If a Card detection is started with the ‘repeating’ polling mode, then later when the Card is removed, the Reader starts again the detection of a new Card.
Whatever the Plugin of Observable Reader, when waiting for the Card removal, any Observable Reader shall have the capability to notify the remove of the Card. Some Plugin solutions could have the capability to notify a Card removal also during the processing of the Card.
Card Selection
Selection scenarios
Depending on the Card transaction use case, or on the Reader capability, there are two ways to manage the Selection of a Card:
Either on a simple Reader, a Selection could be operated directly by transmitting the Selection Request. In this case the same entity manages both the Card Selection and the Card processing.
Otherwise, on an Observable Reader, a Default Selection could be defined. In this case the Selection is operated automatically at the insertion of the Card. In this case, the Card Selection is next managed by the Observable Reader, but the Card processing is managed by a Reader Observer.
Selection setting and processing
A Card Selection request is defined with a Card Selector. A Card Selector could be defined with tree optional levels of selection filter.
The selection could be limited to match a specific card communication protocol.

class:
preparing to read files has been simplified and is done using the unique following method:
preparing to select files is done using the following method:
Note that from now the “prepare” methods no longer return indexes, the data will be placed in the CalypsoPo object.
Retrieving selection results
The

Several ‘Reader Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Reader. In case of SE insertion / match / removal, the observable reader notifies sequentially the registered observers with the corresponding reader event. The observable reader could be a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the plugin event could wait the acknowledge of the notified observers.
An observable reader has the capability to be set with a ‘Default Selections Request’: in this case when a SE is inserted in the reader, the reader will try to operate the configured default selections. If a selection successfully matches with the SE, instead to simply notify the insertion of SE, the observable reader will notify about a successful selection with a SE application.
If the notification mode is defined as ‘always’, then in case of SE insertion, the observable reader will notify a SE matched reader event in case of successful selection, or a simple SE inserted reader event if not.
If the notification mode is defined as ‘matched only’, then in case of SE insertion, simple SE inserted reader events are not notified.
When the processing of an inserted or matched SE is finished, a reader observer must release the logical channel with the Secure Element, in order to prepare the observable reader to detect the removal of the SE.
Observable reader states
An observable reader is active only when at least one reader observer is registered, and if the start of the detection has been requested. When active, an observable read could switch between three internal states: ‘Wait for SE Insertion’, ‘Wait for SE Processing’, & ‘Wait for SE Removal’.
In the nominal case, a Reader Observer indicates to the observable reader that the processing of the SE is finished by releasing the SE Channel. To manage a failure of the reader observer process, the observable reader interface provides also a method to finalize the SE processing.

the information of the selected PO (startup data, file data, … etc).
A transaction with a Calypso PO is fully managed through the PoTransaction object:
First a set of PO commands could be defined through ‘
prepare
’ commands.
Next the prepared PO commands transmitted when operating a ‘
process
’ command.
The responses of the PO are then recovered through the Calypso PO image.
Calypso card image
Calypso transaction
Most of the process methods have a ‘Channel Control’ parameter in order to define if the logical with the selected Calypso has to be kept open or to be closed after the processing of the prepared PO commands.
processPoCommands is used to transmit a set of prepared PO commands outside of a secure session.
processOpening issues an Open Secure Session followed by the prepared PO commands.
processPoCommandsInSession allows to transmit a set of prepared PO commands inside of a secure session.
The Card ATR could be filtered to match a regular expression.
If an AID is defined, the local reader transmits a Select Application APDU command to the card. If a SE Selector is defined without any filter, the selection is always successful if a card is present in the reader.
Depending on the Keyple Card Solution extension library, a card request could be completed with specific card commands to operate at the selection (for example, a Select File for a specific DF LID, the read of a specific file).
For terminal managing several kinds of card applications, a Card Selection could be prepared with several card selection request to operate sequentially with the card.
According to the defined ‘multi selection processing’ mode, the card selection could stop at the first selection request matching card application, otherwise all the prepared card selection request could be operated.
Before the new processing of card selection request, the logical channel previously opened is closed.
The ‘channel control’ defines if the logical channel should be kept open or close after the last processed card selection request.
The result of a card request selection is a card image of a matching card. For a card selection with multiple requests, several matching card could be provided.

Instead, the first prepareReadFile command will be automatically taken into account.
Retrieving data read from POs
This is a major evolution of the Keyple API. Previously, data read from Calyspo POs were retrieved by applications using “parser” methods.
With Keyple API 0.9, Calypso PO data is made available in the CalypsoPo object obtained during selection and enriched all along the operations performed with PoTransaction.
The public getter methods of CalypsoPo are:

Error handling
Since version 0.9, all Keyple exceptions are of the RuntimeException type.
Catching exceptions is therefore now optional.
However, it is possible to selectively catch certain exceptions in order to deal with particular cases.
The new hierarchy of Keyple exceptions is shown

Global Architecture of Keyple
The API is currently divided in two major layers:
The ‘Keyple Core' : a Secure Element Proxy API which allows managing SE readers in a generic way, whaterver the reader driver or environment, and for standalone or distributed solution (
Keyple Core User Guide
).
A ‘Calypso Keyple extension' : a high level Calypso Processing API allowing to operate commands with a Calypso Portable Object, and to manage a secure Calypso transaction (
Keyple Calypso User Guide
).
Dedicated reader’s plugins have to be implemented in order to interface the SE Proxy API with the specific reader’s drivers.

Modules that are provided as artifacts
keyple-core: source and unit tests for the SE Proxy module (artifact : keyple-java-core)
keyple-calypso: source and unit tests for the Calypso library (artifact : keyple-java-calypso)
keyple-plugin: source and unit tests for the different plugins: PC/SC, Stub, etc.
Developer support, testing
example: source for Keyple implementation examples, generic or Calypso specific.
Keyple features and corresponding packages
Keyple features global for any Secure Element solution:
Features
Packages
Selections of Secure Elements (high level API)
keyple::core::
selection
Management of SE readers
Transaction API: management of an explicit application selection on a reader; setting of a default selection operation on an observed reader
Known issues/limits
Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits
the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.
Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7
Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
Known issues/limits
PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception

keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.8
keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.8
keyple-android-plugin-nfc 0.8
keyple-android-plugin-omapi 0.8
The main evolutions concern the Core module:
To avoid misuse of plugins, now plugins have to be registered to the SE Proxy using plugin factories.
For observable readers, the sequence to detect an SE insertion, wait for its processing and for its removal has been fixed too.
All the plugins have been updated to take into account the factory setting and the SE status notifications.
Release Date:
Tuesday, January 28, 2020
Review:
0.8.0 (Java 20/01) Release Review
Release Type:
Major release (API breakage)
IP Due Diligence Type:
Wednesday, September 18, 2019
Project:
Eclipse Keyple
Release:
0.7.0 (Java 19/07)
Description:
keyple-java-core 0.7
SE Proxy API: generic universal interface to interface a smartcard reader; transmission of grouped APDU commands; observable reader notification
Transaction API: management of an explicit application selection on a reader; setting of a default selection operation on an observed reader
Known issues/limits
Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits

The main evolutions concern the Core module:
To avoid misuse of plugins, now plugins have to be registered to the SE Proxy using plugin factories.
For observable readers, the sequence to detect an SE insertion, wait for its processing and for its removal has been fixed too.
All the plugins have been updated to take into account the factory setting and the SE status notifications.

cloning
this repo. Several solutions can be considered:
When installing git for Windows, an option
Enable symbolic links
can be choosen. If it has not been enabled and you want to set it via the installer, a reinstallation is needed
If you do not want to reinstall git, this option can be enabled afterward via the command line
git config core.symlinks true
Also, the option can be enabled once only for this specific cloning operation with
git clone -c core.symlinks=true REPO_URL
It is important to note that for this option to be actually working, the Windows user needs to have the
SeCreateSymbolicLink
permission
: a user with admin rights is typically granted with this permission.
Building the Keyple components
This guide helps developer that want to contribute to Keyple components base code. You can fork the project and contribute to it. Every contribution will be reviewed by the developper team and scan by our CI and quality code tools before being merged to the base code.

Eclipse Keyple 0.8.0 (Java 20/01)
Primary tabs

Release Plan
Review Information
(active tab)
Description:
Release train of the Eclipse Keyple java implementation:
keyple-java-core 0.8
keyple-java-calypso 0.8
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.8
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.8
keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.8
keyple-android-plugin-nfc 0.8
keyple-android-plugin-omapi 0.8
The main evolutions concern the Core module:
To avoid misuse of plugins, now plugins have to be registered to the SE Proxy using plugin factories.
For observable readers, the sequence to detect an SE insertion, wait for its processing and for its removal has been fixed too.
All the plugins have been updated to take into account the factory setting and the SE status notifications.

None

Eclipse Keyple
0.7.0 (Java 19/07)
Review Information
Eclipse Keyple 0.7.0 (Java 19/07)
Primary tabs
Overview
Issues
Release Plan
Review Information
(active tab)
Description:
keyple-java-core 0.7
SE Proxy API: generic universal interface to interface a smartcard reader; transmission of grouped APDU commands; observable reader notification
Transaction API: management of an explicit application selection on a reader; setting of a default selection operation on an observed reader
Known issues/limits
Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.
keyple-java-calypso 0.7
Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
Known issues/limits
the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.
Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.
keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7
Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
Known issues/limits
PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception
keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.7
Reader plugin emulator: allows to define virtual readers to operate the SE Proxy API without native readers.
Known issues/limits:
StubPlugin has a public visibility.
Some tests have a dependency with the Calypso library.
keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.7
Plugin to communicate remotely with a Secure Element; definition of MasterAPI and SlaveAPI to enable Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between Keyple virtual reader terminals and Keyple native reader terminals. MasterAPI manages virtual reader that acts as a proxy to the remote reader.
Known limits in 0.7.0
RemoteSePlugin has a public visibility.
virtualReader#SePresent() API is not implemented
Functions to be renamed in accordance with the RPC standard
keyple-android-plugin-android-nfc 0.7
0.8.0 (Java 20/01) | projects.eclipse.org
Plugin interfacing an observable reader operated through the Android NFC API.
Known issues/limits:
AndroidNfcPlugin has a public visibility.
Usage of 'fragment' to remove from the plugin code
SE remove detection capability added in Android 7.0 not yet supported.
keyple-android-plugin-android-omapi 0.7
Plugin interfacing static readers operated through the SIM Alliance / GlobalPlatform OMAPI.
Known issues/limits:
OmapiPlugin has a public visibility.
Usage of 'fragment' to remove from the plugin code
package API renamed from Android 9.0 not yet supported.

OMAPI
Android plugins':
the new implementations in Kotlin are now optimized for all Android version from Kit Kat 4.4

Compared to the generic Card Selection API (cf. https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple/KeypleCoreApi/KeypleCore_ApplicationApi.html#card-selection), a PO Selector could be defined to accept only non-invalidated Portable Object (in this cas an invalidated PO isn’t selected).
In addition, a PO Selection Request provides methods:
to prepare Select File command (useful in particular to manage REV1 Calypso PO for which the select of the targeted DF is required).
and to prepare simple read record command (useful to optimize the read of a file present on all targeted PO).
The matching SmartCard resulting from a PO Selection Request is a Calypso PO. In case file records have been read during the selection: the corresponding data could be recovered in the Calypso PO card image.
Calypso Portable Object Transaction
A Card Resource is a set of a Reader and a
selected
Card application.
A Calypso Portable Object is the image of a selected Calypso PO.
A Calypso SAM is the image of a selected Calypso SAM.
To operate a Calypso transaction:
At least a Calypso Resource (CardResource
) is required.
A SAM Resource ((CardResource
) is required too if security features are involved (Calypso secure session, Stored value transaction, PIN encryption, etc…).
anchors.add();
A Calypso PO image provides public ‘getters’ in order to
recover
the information of the selected PO (startup data, file data, … etc).
A transaction with a Calypso PO is fully managed through the PoTransaction object:
First a set of PO commands could be defined through ‘
prepare
’ commands.
Next the prepared PO commands transmitted when operating a ‘
process
’ command.
The responses of the PO are then recovered through the Calypso PO image.
Calypso card image
Calypso transaction
Most of the process methods have a ‘Channel Control’ parameter in order to define if the logical with the selected Calypso has to be kept open or to be closed after the processing of the prepared PO commands.
processPoCommands is used to transmit a set of prepared PO commands outside of a secure session.
processOpening issues an Open Secure Session followed by the prepared PO commands.
processPoCommandsInSession allows to transmit a set of prepared PO commands inside of a secure session.
processClosing issues first the last prepared PO commands and transmits a Close Secure Session.
prepareManageSession allows to change authenticate or change the encryption mode.

Global Architecture of Keyple
The API is currently divided in two major layers:
The ‘Keyple Core' : a Secure Element Proxy API which allows managing SE readers in a generic way, whaterver the reader driver or environment, and for standalone or distributed solution.
A ‘Calypso Keyple extension' : a high level Calypso Processing API allowing to operate commands with a Calypso Portable Object, and to manage a secure Calypso transaction.
Dedicated reader’s plugins have to be implemented in order to interface the SE Proxy API with the specific reader’s drivers.
API guides for the Keyple Core and Keyple Calypso are available on

.
For a distributed architecture, the Remote SE Plugin should be used (
Keyple Remote SE User Guide
). In version 0.9 the SE Plugin is still proposed as a draft, a simpler API will be provided in the version 1.0 alpha 1 in October 2020.
Supported platforms

Modules that are provided as artifacts
keyple-core: source and unit tests for the SE Proxy module (artifact : keyple-java-core)
keyple-calypso: source and unit tests for the Calypso library (artifact : keyple-java-calypso)
keyple-plugin: source and unit tests for the different plugins: smartcard.io PC/SC, Stub, Android NFC, Android OMAPI, etc.
developer support, testing
example: source for Keyple implementation examples, generic or Calypso specific.
Keyple Core - features / packages and corresponding usages
The Keyple Core is the basic component of Keyple to handle secure element reader and to operate generic processing with Secure Elements. On Keyple, secure element readers are interfaced through specific reader plugins.

Status message
This proposal has been approved and the
Eclipse Keyple
project has been created.
Eclipse Keyple
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process
) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section.
Parent Project:
The Core is divided in 3 sub-modules:
Reader: includes the API to access and manage a SE reader.
Plugin: provides factorized processing for the implementation of reader plugin.
SE: the generic operation for Secure Element.
(Starting from the version 1.0 of Keyple Core, the sub-modules will be provided in different artifacts with their own versioning).
According to the developer’s objective different API must be imported:
for the implementation of a secure element terminal application, only the high-level API of the ‘reader’ and ‘SE’ modules.
to implement a plugin, all the ‘reader’ API and the low-level ‘plugin’ API.
to develop a dedicated library supporting the command sets and transaction features of a specific secure element solution, the low-level ‘reader’ and ‘SE’ API.

Creation Review | projects.eclipse.org
Eclipse IoT
Background:
Calypso is a set of specifications describing a fast and secure off-line contactless transaction, between a portable object and a terminal. It has been created at the end of the 1990s by some european public transport operators or authority (RATP and SNCF in Paris and all France, STIB in Brussels, OTLIS in Lisbon, ACTV in Venice, Konstanz in Germany), in order to create an open , interoperable and secure standard independent from industrials to ensure a real competition.
Today Calypso represent 20% of the world market of contactless smart ticketing in 25 countries and 125 cities. It brings to his user a guarantee of security and interoperability which relies on a total compliance with existing standards (ISO 14443, ISO 7816-4, Global Platform). The Calypso standard is managed by the Calypso Networks Association (CNA) , which is led by transports operators and public authorities in order to ensure openness and independence from industrials in confront of other proprietary schemes.
The openness for a contactless ticketing standard can be evaluated for the two mains components of ticketing systems, with the complementary concern about guarantee of security:
Cards and portable objects (mobile phones, Java objects, wearables, …)
Terminals (validators, vending equipment, …)
We can affirm that a real openness is achieved for cards and portable objects with the Calypso standard with a large choice of products and providers (card manufacturer, OS makers and chip providers) and a real competition between them.
However, for ticketing equipment the situation is more contrasted. In fact, if the Calypso specifications are open, the terminal applications operating ticketing data (contracts, pricing, user profile) which have to be implemented on top of a smartcard management layer are proprietary of a few ticketing integrator/manufacturer, and the networks who used this solutions may only manage evolutions in a “purchase by agreement” manner, with a direct impact on the price.
Furthermore, other mobility actors (Car sharing, bike sharing…) that would like to be integrated in the mobility ecosystem led by public transport operator would like to benefit of the highly secured Calypso transaction “as a service”, and consequently be ready for global integration without being ”killed” by complexity and security issues that would oblige them to make too big investments.
In fact, from the very beginning, the scope of Calypso Networks Association is to promote the open standard Calypso which has been originally designed for Interoperability in transportation. Nowadays, we are more talking about Mobility, including very different and new modes, and “traditional transport operators are facing commercial and technical issues about providing a door to door seamless travel to their customer. Consequently, Calypso Networks Association, leaded by Public Transport operators, decided to develop and publish an Open Source SDK that could fit with any type of terminal and contactless reader architecture in order to facilitate and spread the adoption of the calypso standard. Thus new mobility actors, transport operators, Local authority will be able to focus on the travelers expectations, commercial agreements and new mobility programs development without losing time on technical issues or allowing smooth evolution of their systems.
Scope:
Eclipse Keyple provides generic librairies for simplifying the development of contactless applications based on the Calypso standard, and for facilitating integration with the secure elements typically involved in a secure contactless solution. Those librairies will also be compliant with the other existing standards af the market.
Description:
The goal of Eclipse Keyple is to allow developers to easily implement fast and secure off-line contactless transactions (using NFC cards, mobile phones, …) based on the Calypso standard.

More specifically, Keyple is a set of open source libraries that will initially be available in Java and C++, designed on the same mutual Object-Oriented Model compatible with any terminal architecture: mobile, embedded or server and Interoperable with any smart card reader solution: standard or proprietary, local or remote.
It manages the advanced security features of Calypso but is also able to manage non-Calypso smartcard solutions, for ticketing or payment.
Keyple defines two layers:
Ticketing applications relies on a high-level
Calypso processing API
to manage Calypso commands & security features. For a session with a Portable Object: SAM commands can be automatically generated and sent to the SAM reader or HSM.
Secure Element (SE) readers are integrated through plugins implementing the
SE Proxy API
which manages the communications with a contactless secure element through ant type of contactless reader (local, remote, standard, proprietary…)
Keyple propose a
Local and Remote
Secure Element optimization:
Cards or SAM’s commands are grouped to limit network exchanges for mobile, embedded terminal or server solution.
Keyple can be used with
Standard or Proprietary
SE reader driver:
It will be packaged with plugins to manage standard Secure Element interfaces: Android NFC Reader, Android SmartCard interface, Windows/Linux PC/SC, Java SmartCard IO PC/SC interface.

Keyple can also be extended with plugins implementation to manage proprietary drivers that could be proposed by smartcard reader manufacturers.
Thanks to its modular architecture, Keyple can be used also to communicate with non Calypso contactless portable objects, using the SE Proxy API.

Generic API to develop a SE specific library
A terminal application operating secure element must only import the Keyple Core packages: ‘seproxy’, ‘event’, ‘protocol’ and ‘selection’.
A reader plugin could be implemented by importing the ‘plugin’, ‘message’ and ‘seproxy’ packages.
A secure element specific library could be implemented on top of the ‘message’ and ‘command’ packages.

Parent Project:

Background:
Calypso is a set of specifications describing a fast and secure off-line contactless transaction, between a portable object and a terminal. It has been created at the end of the 1990s by some european public transport operators or authority (RATP and SNCF in Paris and all France, STIB in Brussels, OTLIS in Lisbon, ACTV in Venice, Konstanz in Germany), in order to create an open , interoperable and secure standard independent from industrials to ensure a real competition.
Today Calypso represent 20% of the world market of contactless smart ticketing in 25 countries and 125 cities. It brings to his user a guarantee of security and interoperability which relies on a total compliance with existing standards (ISO 14443, ISO 7816-4, Global Platform). The Calypso standard is managed by the Calypso Networks Association (CNA) , which is led by transports operators and public authorities in order to ensure openness and independence from industrials in confront of other proprietary schemes.
The openness for a contactless ticketing standard can be evaluated for the two mains components of ticketing systems, with the complementary concern about guarantee of security:
Cards and portable objects (mobile phones, Java objects, wearables, …)
Terminals (validators, vending equipment, …)
We can affirm that a real openness is achieved for cards and portable objects with the Calypso standard with a large choice of products and providers (card manufacturer, OS makers and chip providers) and a real competition between them.
However, for ticketing equipment the situation is more contrasted. In fact, if the Calypso specifications are open, the terminal applications operating ticketing data (contracts, pricing, user profile) which have to be implemented on top of a smartcard management layer are proprietary of a few ticketing integrator/manufacturer, and the networks who used this solutions may only manage evolutions in a “purchase by agreement” manner, with a direct impact on the price.
Furthermore, other mobility actors (Car sharing, bike sharing…) that would like to be integrated in the mobility ecosystem led by public transport operator would like to benefit of the highly secured Calypso transaction “as a service”, and consequently be ready for global integration without being ”killed” by complexity and security issues that would oblige them to make too big investments.
In fact, from the very beginning, the scope of Calypso Networks Association is to promote the open standard Calypso which has been originally designed for Interoperability in transportation. Nowadays, we are more talking about Mobility, including very different and new modes, and “traditional transport operators are facing commercial and technical issues about providing a door to door seamless travel to their customer. Consequently, Calypso Networks Association, leaded by Public Transport operators, decided to develop and publish an Open Source SDK that could fit with any type of terminal and contactless reader architecture in order to facilitate and spread the adoption of the calypso standard. Thus new mobility actors, transport operators, Local authority will be able to focus on the travelers expectations, commercial agreements and new mobility programs development without losing time on technical issues or allowing smooth evolution of their systems.
Scope:
Eclipse Keyple provides generic librairies for simplifying the development of contactless applications based on the Calypso standard, and for facilitating integration with the secure elements typically involved in a secure contactless solution. Those librairies will also be compliant with the other existing standards af the market.
All the components are based on the API of the Java Runtime Environment Standard Edition version 6: the OpenJDK is based on the ‘GNU General Public License’ in version 2.
The two Android components use in addition some API specific Android environment: the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is based on the ‘Apache Software License’ in Version 2.0.
The OMAPI plugin imports also API of the SEEK for Android project (
https://github.com/seek-for-android/
) based on the ‘Apache Software License’ in Version 2.0.
Unit tests & logging involve
the Junit API distributed under the Eclipse Public License v2.0 (
https://junit.org
&
https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/
),
the SLF4J API (Simple Logging Facade for Java) distributed under the ‘MIT License’ (
https://www.slf4j.org
&
https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j
),
the structolg4j API (Structured logging for Java) distributed under the ‘MIT License’ (
APDU command builders
APDU response parsers
(technical parameter settings specific to the PO & SAM revisions)
Ticketing terminal applications must import only the high-level Calypso transaction package.
The only exception is the implementation a Calypso PO/SAM test tool, the setting of low-level APDU commands with wrong settings could require the usage of the Calypso command packages.
Getting started
Releases and snapshots are available from Maven central repositories.

Description:
The goal of Eclipse Keyple is to allow developers to easily implement fast and secure off-line contactless transactions (using NFC cards, mobile phones, …) based on the Calypso standard.
More specifically, Keyple is a set of open source libraries that will initially be available in Java and C++, designed on the same mutual Object-Oriented Model compatible with any terminal architecture: mobile, embedded or server and Interoperable with any smart card reader solution: standard or proprietary, local or remote.
It manages the advanced security features of Calypso but is also able to manage non-Calypso smartcard solutions, for ticketing or payment.
Keyple defines two layers:
Ticketing applications relies on a high-level
Calypso processing API
to manage Calypso commands & security features. For a session with a Portable Object: SAM commands can be automatically generated and sent to the SAM reader or HSM.
Secure Element (SE) readers are integrated through plugins implementing the
SE Proxy API
which manages the communications with a contactless secure element through ant type of contactless reader (local, remote, standard, proprietary…)
Keyple propose a
Local and Remote
Secure Element optimization:
Cards or SAM’s commands are grouped to limit network exchanges for mobile, embedded terminal or server solution.
Keyple can be used with

The project uses also the Apache Commons API based on the ‘Apache Software License’ in Version 2.0.

this repo. Several solutions can be considered:
When installing git for Windows, an option
Enable symbolic links
can be choosen. If it has not been enabled and you want to set it via the installer, a reinstallation is needed
If you do not want to reinstall git, this option can be enabled afterward via the command line
git config core.symlinks true
Also, the option can be enabled once only for this specific cloning operation with
git clone -c core.symlinks=true REPO_URL
It is important to note that for this option to be actually working, the Windows user needs to have the
SeCreateSymbolicLink
permission
: a user with admin rights is typically granted with this permission.
Import keyple components with Gradle
When using gradle, it is fairly simple to import Keyple components into your project. Just add the following statements to your build.gradle file :
Artifacts
The Eclipse Keyple Java artifacts are published on the Eclipse Keyple Project page [
Standard or Proprietary
SE reader driver:
It will be packaged with plugins to manage standard Secure Element interfaces: Android NFC Reader, Android SmartCard interface, Windows/Linux PC/SC, Java SmartCard IO PC/SC interface.
Keyple can also be extended with plugins implementation to manage proprietary drivers that could be proposed by smartcard reader manufacturers.
Thanks to its modular architecture, Keyple can be used also to communicate with non Calypso contactless portable objects, using the SE Proxy API.
