Eclipse Cyclone DDS is an implementation of the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification (see http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/ ) and the related specifications for interoperability (see http://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/ )
With 'DATA' being 'the currency of the IOT', having a proper data-sharing technology will be a key-asset in any IOT-platform. The OMG DDS standard is recognized as a highly applicable standard for reliable and robust data-sharing in business- and mission-critical environments (
see
http://www.iiconsortium.org/IIRA.htm
and
http://www.iiconsortium.org/IICF.htm
)
and with that a great fit with the Eclipse-IOT ecosystem.
Eclipse Cyclone DDS offers unique data-sharing capabilities compared to the already existing Eclipse solutions (i.e. for messaging).
With a history of proven applicability in the military C4I domain (that are not so much unlike upcoming large-scale IOT-systems where you can also distinguish between planning-, awareness- and execution-grids that all impose specific requirements w.r.t. interoperabillity, high-volume data-sharing and deterministic/real-time data-access) we are confident that starting from day-1 this offering can significantly reduce the complexity of many IOT-systems and with that reduce their integration efforts and risks.
Furthermore we are confident that the Eclipse-IOT ecosystem will benefit even more by active participation in the evolution of this technology and the (OMG-)standard its based upon.

Eclipse Cyclone DDS 0.7.0 (Coquette) Release Review
Type:
Release
State:
Withdrawn
End Date of the Review Period:
Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.
Wednesday, August 5, 2020
Project:
Eclipse Cyclone DDS
Release:
0.7.0 (Coquette)
Description:
The key feature of this release is the support for the core of DDS Security 1.1: authentication, access control and encryption. The other significant change is the much improved behaviour for very large samples: an improved retransmit strategy reduces the number of unnecessary retransmits and eliminates the sometimes excessive latencies.
DDS Security defines a set of plug-in interfaces and protocol hooks that are part of the core DDS implementation and a set of "default" plug-ins that users may expect the DDS implementation to provide, but they can also provide their own plug-ins. The default plug-ins rely on standard cryptographical techniques (AES for symmetric encryption, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, etc.) and are typically sufficient for protecting a DDS system.
One can choose at build-time whether to include the interfaces and protocol hooks in the core of Cyclone DDS. Leaving it out significantly reduces the size of the code and brings a tiny performance improvement. If security supported is compiled out, the DDS_HAS_SECURITY macro will be undefined (otherwise it is defined to 1) and any attempt at creating a participant with security settings will be rejected with a "precondition not met" failure.
A lot of effort has gone into testing and checking that malformed or unexpected messages are handled correctly, that message authentication codes are checked and that no data never goes out unencrypted by accident. Still, it is significant amount of code and it is only prudent to assume the worst for a new implementation of such a complex specification.
Architectural Issues:
The overall architecture is holding up just fine, but there remain many, mostly local, details that need reworking. The addition of DDS Security has unfortunately laid bare some more of these details.
Cleaning up these issues is an ongoing process, undertaken as a background activity while working towards covering all of the DDS specification famliy. The number of issues reported by people remains very low despite evidence of a growing user base, and this is also an indication that the fundamental architectural choices are sound.
Security Issues:
There is currently no dependency of Cyclone DDS on any other project, and therefore no relationship to any of these resolved vulnerabilities. We don't currently provide binary releases and rely on users to follow best-practices of staying up to date with their dependencies, in our case, OpenSSL. (Open Robotics is providing binary packages using up-to-date dependencies.)
Given that Cyclone DDS now supports DDS Security, it is now "at risk" of having vulnerabilities. None are known at this point in time, but it must be assumed that some exist.
Non-Code Aspects:
The documentation is very basic but appears to be good enough for those who are willing to invest a bit and make a few educated guesses, based on the evidence of increasing usage and the questions that have been asked on GitHub. Presentation of the documentation and providing easy access to it (e.g., via readthedocs.io), as well as a proper website is still missing, but there are some indications that help will come.
How many users there would have been by now had the documentation been better is anyone's guess. Thus, it is one of the main points needing attention.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
Not verified
Usability Details:
As it is middleware the intended audience is very minimal and there is no user interface to speak of.
End of Life:
None.
Standards:
OMG DDS:
DCPS specification version 1.4 (with a more friendly API)
DDSI specification version 2.3
Security specification version 1.1
Communities:
The use of and contributions to Cyclone DDS has grown notably since becoming a tier-1 middleware in "Foxy Fitzroy", released June 5. This is visible in several ways: more well-known companies putting their logo up on the "adopters" board (https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/?#iot.cyclonedds), more issues and pull requests on Cyclone DDS itself, but more notably on the ROS 2 Middleware abstraction where various people have now joined in maintaining the abstraction layer. The number of downloads as reported by GitHub has gone up significantly as well.
There are also activities underway to combine Cyclone DDS and Eclipse Iceoryx to get the best of both in a single system, and to combine Cyclone DDS and Eclipse Zenoh to overcome some of the scalability limitations inherent in the DDS specification.

Project:
Eclipse Cyclone DDS
Release:
0.1.0 (Preambule)
Description:
A long overdue first release for Cyclone, on request from the (small) community.
Architectural Issues:
Cyclone DDS supports Linux, macOS and Windows as first-tier platforms. The code builds cleanly on all of them and all tests consistently pass. The occasional build failures in the continuous integration builds are related to infrastructure issues where downloading prequisites (such as maven) sometimes fails. Use of static analysis tools is so far limited to Clang's static analyzer (clean there, too), and we're working on getting it checked by Coverity Scan for a more thorough analysis.
The initial contribution was a combination of sources of various ages and with various different naming philosophies and programming styles. This needs addressing for two reasons in particular: firstly, it is well known that such discrepancies can easily hide bugs, and secondly, this is a barrier to new contributors. Eliminating these discrepancies is an ongoing process.
Fortunately, there is evidence that the negative impact is minor: the number of known issues in the code is very small, it generally exhibits excellent performance and no nasty misbehaviours (based on our own observations and issues raised by the community). Secondly, although there are very few direct contributions from people in the community, they have suggested a number of improvements and some have also indicated that they have put in additional features they required. (We've invited them to contribute their fixes or enhancements, but so far no pull requests have come.)
Another area of ongoing improvement is that of modularisation of various internal components and making them pluggable. The aim here is to make it easier to alter the behaviour or provide optimised implementations for specific uses. These components cover such things as message representations, implementation of data storage on behalf of the application and networking interfaces. These changes will turn Cyclone DDS from a dedicated DDS implementation into a more general platform that can then be optimised for specific applications. Needless to say, anyone who simply wishes to use DDS will always be able to do so without being required to do such specialisation.
Security Issues:
Cyclone has does not rely on any of the projects listed in the Bug List. There are no known vulnerabilities in Cyclone itself at this time, but the overwhelming likelihood is that there are plenty but that no serious effort has yet been spent on finding them.
Non-Code Aspects:

Contribution Activity:
Documentation is included in the sources and currently primarily aimed at generating a manual in PDF format. The generated PDF is hosted on GitHub and referenced from the project's top-level README. While this document is limited, it does include an API reference section, a "getting started" chapter and a guide to configuring Cyclone. Furthermore, a tool for editing the XML configuration file is included as well, which is relevant especially because it provides reference documentation for each of the settings.
The documentation and examples appear to be adequate for new users to get started, as the questions asked on GitHub were all concerning rather more advanced problems. That said, as is often the case, the documentation and examples are in need of improvement. One area in particular has our current attention, and that is converting from a PDF format to a more convenient, web-hosted format. This will make it much more accessible in practice.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:
Not verified
Usability Details:
There is no end-user tooling.
End of Life:
None.
Standards:
OMG DDS 1.4 (Minimum Profile with some of the Content Filtered Profile), but with an alternative API.
OMG DDSI-RTPS 2.2
Communities:
Presentation at Eclipse IoT Asia; and otherwise a number of questions, comments and bugs on GitHub. The number of individuals is small, but the quality of the questions and comments has increased tremendously, showing that these people have really invested time in studying the code. Some small contributions have been made, but unfortunately as suggestions rather than as pull requests, despite inviting them to do a pull request.

Eclipse Cyclone DDS
Release:
0.5.0 (Eusebius)
Description:
Major features
Support for ROS2 Dashing and Eloquent (via an adaption layer), with very positive response from various members in the ROS2 community.
Support for an arbitrary number of concurrent DDS domains (fully independent instantiations of DDS) in a single process — this is a common feature for DDS implementations, but involved quite a bit of surgery for Cyclone DDS because of its heritage.
Abstracting the notion of samples, types and reader history caches, allowing overriding the default implementations of these to get behaviours more suited to the applications. This is particularly relevant to language bindings and embedding Cyclone DDS in other frameworks, such as ROS2.
Platform support is extended beyond the usual Linux/Windows/macOS: FreeRTOS, Solaris 2.6 are now known to work, with CI builds for FreeRTOS-simulator-on-Linux expected to be in before the release is planned.
A variety of bug fixes, static analysis and test coverage improvements, and small usability enhancements.
On the proposed version number
The jump to 0.5 is because I have received some comments that "0.1" (and hence "0.2") makes Cyclone DDS look much less mature than it really is. I personally think that should not carry too much weight, but in the naming scheme following the movements of Schumann's Carnaval, 5 maps nicely to the calm and deliberate "Eusebius" — and this is a time to steadily move forward with considered steps. Obviously "1.0" would be a nicer version number still, but I do not believe that is a sensible step just yet:
Some parts of the API need a revision and while the changes will be minor, it appears likely that it will require updating application code. That change should be done before (or coinciding with) releasing 1.0.
Two key features are not in place yet: an implementation of the DDS Security specification, and support for what the specification calls "transient data", that is, data managed by the infrastructure and remaining available to new subscribers even when the original publishers have terminated. Given these efforts are progressing, it is again not a good time to think of releasing 1.0.

Review Information
Significant new features
Support for mixed-language programming by supporting multiple (de)serializers for a single topic in a single process. This way, a program that consists of, say, C and C++ can use a different representation of the data in C than in C++. Before, all readers/writers in the process would be forced to use the same representation (or perform an additional copy). Currently C is still the only natively supported language, but one can use an evolving-but-reasonable-stable interface to implement different mappings.
Improved QoS support: full support for deadline, lifespan and liveliness. The first is for generating notifications when a configured instance update rate is not achieved, the second for automatically removing stale samples, the third for different modes of monitoring the liveliness of peers.
Improved scalability in matching readers and writers. Before it used to try matching a new local or remote reader or writer with all known local & remote entities, now only with the right group with the correct topic name.

Correct handling of non-English network interface names
Architectural Issues:
The overall architecture is holding up just fine, but there remain many, mostly local, details that need reworking. This is an ongoing process, undertaken as a background activity while working towards covering all of the DDS specification famliy. The number of issues reported by people remains very low despite evidence of a growing user base, and this is also an indication that the fundamental architectural choices are sound.
Security Issues:
No known issues.
Non-Code Aspects:
The documentation is very basic but appears to be good enough for those who are willing to invest a bit and make a few educated guesses, based on the evidence of increasing usage and the questions that have been asked on GitHub. Presentation of the documentation and providing easy access to it (e.g., via readthedocs.io), as well as a proper website is still missing, but there are some indications that help will come.
How many users there would have been by now had the documentation been better is anyone's guess. Thus, it is one of the main points needing attention.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines:

Usability Details:
As it is middleware the intended audience is very minimal and there is no user interface to speak of.
End of Life:
None.

DDSI specification version 2.3
Communities:
This release is specifically aimed at matching the upcoming "
Foxy Fitzroy
" release of ROS2, where Cyclone DDS is one of 3 tier-1 middleware options. We're quite proud of this: at the time of the initial release of "Dashing" there was no support for Cyclone DDS at all, both other tier-1 middleware options were there from the beginning, and no other newcomers have even made it to tier-2.
The tireless promotion of Cyclone DDS in the ROS2 community by Mr. Joe Speed (in particular) has dramatically increased visibility and use of Cyclone DDS. Some rather well-known companies have chosen to use Cyclone DDS over the incumbent middleware implementations in the ROS2 ecosystem (https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/?#iot.cyclonedds).
All this has led to more community involvement and more contributions from people outside the original circle. Examples include a port to a research operating system and fuzzing it to find bugs (the two bugs reported had both been discovered and fixed independently, fortunately).

Description:
The key feature of this release is the support for the core of DDS Security 1.1: authentication, access control and encryption. The other significant change is the much improved behaviour for very large samples: an improved retransmit strategy reduces the number of unnecessary retransmits and eliminates the sometimes excessive latencies.
DDS Security defines a set of plug-in interfaces and protocol hooks that are part of the core DDS implementation and a set of "default" plug-ins that users may expect the DDS implementation to provide, but they can also provide their own plug-ins. The default plug-ins rely on standard cryptographical techniques (AES for symmetric encryption, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, etc.) and are typically sufficient for protecting a DDS system.

If nothing happens,
One can choose at build-time whether to include the interfaces and protocol hooks in the core of Cyclone DDS. Leaving it out significantly reduces the size of the code and brings a tiny performance improvement. If security supported is compiled out, the DDS_HAS_SECURITY macro will be undefined (otherwise it is defined to 1) and any attempt at creating a participant with security settings will be rejected with a "precondition not met" failure.
A lot of effort has gone into testing and checking that malformed or unexpected messages are handled correctly, that message authentication codes are checked and that no data never goes out unencrypted by accident. Still, it is significant amount of code and it is only prudent to assume the worst for a new implementation of such a complex specification.
Architectural Issues:
The overall architecture is holding up just fine, but there remain many, mostly local, details that need reworking. The addition of DDS Security has unfortunately laid bare some more of these details.
Cleaning up these issues is an ongoing process, undertaken as a background activity while working towards covering all of the DDS specification famliy. The number of issues reported by people remains very low despite evidence of a growing user base, and this is also an indication that the fundamental architectural choices are sound.
Security Issues:
There is currently no dependency of Cyclone DDS on any other project, and therefore no relationship to any of these resolved vulnerabilities. We don't currently provide binary releases and rely on users to follow best-practices of staying up to date with their dependencies, in our case, OpenSSL. (Open Robotics is providing binary packages using up-to-date dependencies.)
Given that Cyclone DDS now supports DDS Security, it is now "at risk" of having vulnerabilities. None are known at this point in time, but it must be assumed that some exist.
Non-Code Aspects:
The documentation is very basic but appears to be good enough for those who are willing to invest a bit and make a few educated guesses, based on the evidence of increasing usage and the questions that have been asked on GitHub. Presentation of the documentation and providing easy access to it (e.g., via readthedocs.io), as well as a proper website is still missing, but there are some indications that help will come.

Communities:
The use of and contributions to Cyclone DDS has grown notably since becoming a tier-1 middleware in "Foxy Fitzroy", released June 5. This is visible in several ways: more well-known companies putting their logo up on the "adopters" board (https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/?#iot.cyclonedds), more issues and pull requests on Cyclone DDS itself, but more notably on the ROS 2 Middleware abstraction where various people have now joined in maintaining the abstraction layer. The number of downloads as reported by GitHub has gone up significantly as well.
There are also activities underway to combine Cyclone DDS and Eclipse Iceoryx to get the best of both in a single system, and to combine Cyclone DDS and Eclipse Zenoh to overcome some of the scalability limitations inherent in the DDS specification.

Review Information
Release Date:
Thursday, August 6, 2020
Compatibility:
No backwards incompatible changes in the stable interfaces.
Some small changes in the still-evolving extension interfaces for custom reader history caches and sample representations require changes to and recompilation of code that depends on them. Preprocessor defines can be used to determine whether the updated versions are available.
Target Environments:
Cyclone DDS's own CI on travis ensures compatibility with Windows, Linux and macOS on x64. The integration in ROS2 means 32-bit and 64-bit Linux on ARM are tested daily as well. Solaris, FreeRTOS, VxWorks, *BSD and Android are known to work.

C++ binding for Eclipse Cyclone DDS
An implementation of the
ISO/IEC C++ PSM
, or simply put, a C++ binding for
Eclipse Cyclone DDS
. Cyclone DDS is developed completely in the open as an Eclipse IoT project (see
eclipse-cyclone-dds
) with a growing list of
adopters
(if you're one of them, please add your
logo
). It is a tier-1 middleware for the Robot Operating System
ROS 2
.

Depending on whether you want to develop applications using the C++ binding for Cyclone DDS or contribute to it you can follow different procedures.
For application developers
To build and install the required libraries needed to develop your own applications using the C++ binding for Cyclone DDS requires a few simple steps. There are some small differences between Linux and macOS on the one hand, and Windows on the other. For Linux or macOS:
and for Windows:
where you should replace
<install-location>
by the directory under which you would like to install the C++ binding for Cyclone DDS and
<generator-name>
by one of the ways CMake
generators
offer for generating build files. For example, "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" would target a 64-bit build using Visual Studio 2017.
To install it after a successful build, do:
Which will copy everything to:
<install-location>/lib
<install-location>/bin
<install-location>/include/ddsc
<install-location>/share/CycloneDDS-CXX
Depending on the installation location you may need administrator privileges.

At this point you are ready to use Eclipse Cyclone DDS in your own projects.
Note that the default build type is a release build with debug information included (RelWithDebInfo), which is generally the most convenient type of build to use from applications because of a good mix between performance and still being able to debug things. If you'd rather have a Debug or pure Release build, set
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
accordingly.
Contributing to Eclipse Cyclone DDS
We very much welcome all contributions to the project, whether that is questions, examples, bug fixes, enhancements or improvements to the documentation, or anything else really. When considering contributing code, it might be good to know that build configurations for Travis CI and AppVeyor are present in the repository and that there is a test suite using CTest and Google Test that can be built locally if desired. To build it, set the cmake variable
BUILD_TESTING
to on when configuring, e.g.:
Such a build requires the presence of
Google Test
. You can install this yourself, or you can choose to instead rely on the
Conan
package manager that the CI build infrastructure also uses. In that case, install Conan and do:
in the build directory prior to running
cmake
. This will automatically download and/or build Google Test.
The Google Test Conan package is hosted in the Bincrafters Bintray repository. In case this repository was not added to your Conan remotes list yet (and the above mentioned install command failed because it could not find the Google Test package), you can add the Bintray repository by:

Documentation
The documentation is still rather limited, and at the moment only available in the sources (in the form of restructured text files in

and Doxygen comments in the header files). The intent is to automate the process of building the documentation and have them available in more convenient formats and in the usual locations.
Building and Running the HelloWorld Example
We will show you how to build and run an example program that illustrates the necessary steps to setup DCPS entities. The examples are built automatically when you build the C++ language binding for Cyclone DDS, so you don't need to follow these steps to be able to run the program, it is merely to illustrate the process.

Building Eclipse Cyclone DDS
In order to build Cyclone DDS you need a Linux, Mac or Windows 10 machine (or, with some caveats, a *BSD, OpenIndiana or a Solaris 2.6 one) with the following installed on your host:
C compiler (most commonly GCC on Linux, Visual Studio on Windows, Xcode on macOS);
GIT version control system;
CMake
, version 3.7 or later;
OpenSSL
, preferably version 1.1 or later if you want to use TLS over TCP. You can explicitly disable it by setting
ENABLE_SSL=NO
, which is very useful for reducing the footprint or when the FindOpenSSL CMake script gives you trouble;
Java JDK, version 8 or later, e.g.,
OpenJDK
;
Apache Maven
, version 3.5 or later.

Eclipse Cyclone DDS
Proposal:
Eclipse Cyclone DDS
Parent Project:

Background:
Acceptance of Eclipse Cyclone DDS as a recognized (data-sharing) standard in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
(
see
http://www.iiconsortium.org/IIRA.htm
and

for a detailed assessment of this)
really calls for an opensource-based solution and we feel that Eclipse IoT can provide the thriving ecosystem that will make this project a huge success
In the scope of this project we (ADLINK) will contribute our proven DDS solution as a starting point for a true open-source DDS offering with applicability in a wide range of existing and upcoming IoT applications.

apt install maven default-jdk
should do the trick for getting Java and Maven installed, and the rest should already be there. On Windows, installing chocolatey and
choco install git cmake openjdk maven
should get you a long way. On macOS,
brew install maven cmake
and downloading and installing the JDK is easiest.
The only Java-based component is the IDL preprocessor. The run-time libraries are pure C code, so there is no need to have Java available on "target" machines. If desired, it is possible to do a build without Java or Maven installed by defining
BUILD_IDLC=NO
, but that effectively only gets you the core library. For the current
ROS 2 RMW layer
, that is sufficient.

This project implements the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification (see http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/ ) and the related specifications for interoperability (see http://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/ )
Description:
With 'DATA' being 'the currency of the IOT', having a proper data-sharing technology will be a key-asset in any IOT-platform. The OMG DDS standard is recognized as a highly applicable standard for reliable and robust data-sharing in business- and mission-critical environments (
see
http://www.iiconsortium.org/IIRA.htm
and
http://www.iiconsortium.org/IICF.htm
)
and with that a great fit with the Eclipse-IOT ecosystem.
Why Here?:
Eclipse Cyclone DDS offers unique data-sharing capabilities compared to the already existing Eclipse solutions (i.e. for messaging).
With a history of proven applicability in the military C4I domain (that are not so much unlike upcoming large-scale IOT-systems where you can also distinguish between planning-, awareness- and execution-grids that all impose specific requirements w.r.t. interoperabillity, high-volume data-sharing and deterministic/real-time data-access) we are confident that starting from day-1 this offering can significantly reduce the complexity of many IOT-systems and with that reduce their integration efforts and risks.
Furthermore we are confident that the Eclipse-IOT ecosystem will benefit even more by active participation in the evolution of this technology and the (OMG-)standard its based upon.

Initial Contribution:
The initial contribution will exist of
the Vortex OpenSplice code-base (v6.8): a polyglot DDS implementation covering all DCPS-profiles and related QoS-policies
​
Apart from some third-party libraries, all code is currently owned by
ADLINK
and there currently exists a modest (1000+ members) community around its Community Edition (based on the v6.7 codebase, see
http://www.prismtech.com/dds-community
) which obviously will migrate to Eclipse too.

Review Information
(active tab)
Description:
A long overdue first release for Cyclone, on request from the (small) community.
Architectural Issues:
Cyclone DDS supports Linux, macOS and Windows as first-tier platforms. The code builds cleanly on all of them and all tests consistently pass. The occasional build failures in the continuous integration builds are related to infrastructure issues where downloading prequisites (such as maven) sometimes fails. Use of static analysis tools is so far limited to Clang's static analyzer (clean there, too), and we're working on getting it checked by Coverity Scan for a more thorough analysis.
A 3rd party software list will be provided immediately, code can be expected within 1 month of project acceptance
Future Work:
support for the extensible data-types specification (OMG DDS-Xtypes rev 1.2)
support for the interoperable DDS security specification (OMG DDS-Security rev 1.0)
​Furthermore we foresee a flow of tools and additional-features and integrations from our commercial offering towards opensource as the need for them grows by the community and its uptake of DDS. Concrete examples of this are our evolving 'Vortex Insight' tooling for monitoring DDS-based systems and prototyped integrations with 3rd party tools such as apache-spark/storm, node-red and freeboard (see http://prismtech.github.io/ which will be transferred to Eclipse too)
From our experience of IOT projects, we foresee webinars to the community and use case stories, as well as sponsoring events and presenting at them. We would also like to contribute plugins to other eclipse IOT projects to enable users to benefit from DDS

Replace

with a name that identifies the repository (e.g.

For Windows, depending on the generator, you might also need to add switches to select the architecture and build type, e.g.,
conan install -s arch=x86_64 -s build_type=Debug ..
This will automatically download and/or build CUnit (and, at the moment, OpenSSL).
Documentation
The documentation is still rather limited, and at the moment only available in the sources (in the form of restructured text files in
docs
and Doxygen comments in the header files), or as a
PDF
. The intent is to automate the process of building the documentation and have them available in more convenient formats and in the usual locations.
Building and Running the Roundtrip Example
We will show you how to build and run an example program that measures latency. The examples are built automatically when you build Cyclone DDS, so you don't need to follow these steps to be able to run the program, it is merely to illustrate the process.
The initial contribution was a combination of sources of various ages and with various different naming philosophies and programming styles. This needs addressing for two reasons in particular: firstly, it is well known that such discrepancies can easily hide bugs, and secondly, this is a barrier to new contributors. Eliminating these discrepancies is an ongoing process.
Fortunately, there is evidence that the negative impact is minor: the number of known issues in the code is very small, it generally exhibits excellent performance and no nasty misbehaviours (based on our own observations and issues raised by the community). Secondly, although there are very few direct contributions from people in the community, they have suggested a number of improvements and some have also indicated that they have put in additional features they required. (We've invited them to contribute their fixes or enhancements, but so far no pull requests have come.)
Another area of ongoing improvement is that of modularisation of various internal components and making them pluggable. The aim here is to make it easier to alter the behaviour or provide optimised implementations for specific uses. These components cover such things as message representations, implementation of data storage on behalf of the application and networking interfaces. These changes will turn Cyclone DDS from a dedicated DDS implementation into a more general platform that can then be optimised for specific applications. Needless to say, anyone who simply wishes to use DDS will always be able to do so without being required to do such specialisation.
Security Issues:
Cyclone has does not rely on any of the projects listed in the Bug List. There are no known vulnerabilities in Cyclone itself at this time, but the overwhelming likelihood is that there are plenty but that no serious effort has yet been spent on finding them.
Non-Code Aspects:
Documentation is included in the sources and currently primarily aimed at generating a manual in PDF format. The generated PDF is hosted on GitHub and referenced from the project's top-level README. While this document is limited, it does include an API reference section, a "getting started" chapter and a guide to configuring Cyclone. Furthermore, a tool for editing the XML configuration file is included as well, which is relevant especially because it provides reference documentation for each of the settings.
The documentation and examples appear to be adequate for new users to get started, as the questions asked on GitHub were all concerning rather more advanced problems. That said, as is often the case, the documentation and examples are in need of improvement. One area in particular has our current attention, and that is converting from a PDF format to a more convenient, web-hosted format. This will make it much more accessible in practice.

On another terminal, start the application that will be sending the pings:
The numbers above were measured on Mac running a 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7 on December 12th 2018. From these numbers you can see how the roundtrip is very stable and the minimal latency is now down to 17 micro-seconds (used to be 25 micro-seconds) on this HW.
Performance
Reliable message throughput is over 1MS/s for very small samples and is roughly 90% of GbE with 100 byte samples, and latency is about 30us when measured using
ddsperf
between two Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1270 V2 @ 3.50GHz (that's 2012 hardware ...) running Ubuntu 16.04, with the executables built on Ubuntu 18.04 using gcc 7.4.0 for a default (i.e., "RelWithDebInfo") build.
This is with the subscriber in listener mode, using asynchronous delivery for the throughput test. The configuration is a marginally tweaked out-of-the-box configuration: an increased maximum message size and fragment size, and an increased high-water mark for the reliability window on the writer side. For details, see the
scripts
directory, the
environment details
and the
throughput
and
latency
data underlying the graphs. These also include CPU usage (
throughput
and
OMG DDS 1.4 (Minimum Profile with some of the Content Filtered Profile), but with an alternative API.
OMG DDSI-RTPS 2.2
Communities:
Presentation at Eclipse IoT Asia; and otherwise a number of questions, comments and bugs on GitHub. The number of individuals is small, but the quality of the questions and comments has increased tremendously, showing that these people have really invested time in studying the code. Some small contributions have been made, but unfortunately as suggestions rather than as pull requests, despite inviting them to do a pull request.

.
Configuration
The out-of-the-box configuration should usually be fine, but there are a great many options that can be tweaked by creating an XML file with the desired settings and defining the
CYCLONEDDS_URI
to point to it. E.g. (on Linux):
(on Windows, one would have to use
set CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://...
instead.)
This example shows a few things:
NetworkInterfaceAddress
can be used to override the interface selected by default (you can use the address or the interface name). Proper use of multiple network interfaces simultaneously will come, but is not there yet.
AllowMulticast
configures the circumstances under which multicast will be used. If the selected interface doesn't support it, it obviously won't be used (
false
); but if it does support it, the type of the network adapter determines the default value. For a wired network, it will use multicast for initial discovery as well as for data when there are multiple peers that the data needs to go to (

control the maximum size of the RTPS messages (basically the size of the UDP payload), and the size of the fragments into which very large samples get split (which needs to be "a bit" less). Large values such as these typically improve performance over the (current) default values.
WhcHigh
determines when the sender will wait for acknowledgements from the readers because it has buffered too much unacknowledged data. There is some auto-tuning, the (current) default value is a bit small to get really high throughput.

Description:
Significant new features
Support for mixed-language programming by supporting multiple (de)serializers for a single topic in a single process. This way, a program that consists of, say, C and C++ can use a different representation of the data in C than in C++. Before, all readers/writers in the process would be forced to use the same representation (or perform an additional copy). Currently C is still the only natively supported language, but one can use an evolving-but-reasonable-stable interface to implement different mappings.

Improved QoS support: full support for deadline, lifespan and liveliness. The first is for generating notifications when a configured instance update rate is not achieved, the second for automatically removing stale samples, the third for different modes of monitoring the liveliness of peers.
Improved scalability in matching readers and writers. Before it used to try matching a new local or remote reader or writer with all known local & remote entities, now only with the right group with the correct topic name.
Improved tracing: discovery data is now printed properly and user samples have more type information allowing floating-point and signed numbers to be traced in a more readable form.
Extension of platform support
Known to work on FreeBSD, CheriBSD
Known to work with the musl C library
Windows-specific changes
Fixes multicasts to addresses also used by non-Cyclone processes (caused by accidentally linking with an old sockets library)
Correct handling of non-English network interface names
Architectural Issues:
The overall architecture is holding up just fine, but there remain many, mostly local, details that need reworking. This is an ongoing process, undertaken as a background activity while working towards covering all of the DDS specification famliy. The number of issues reported by people remains very low despite evidence of a growing user base, and this is also an indication that the fundamental architectural choices are sound.
Security Issues:
No known issues.
Non-Code Aspects:
The documentation is very basic but appears to be good enough for those who are willing to invest a bit and make a few educated guesses, based on the evidence of increasing usage and the questions that have been asked on GitHub. Presentation of the documentation and providing easy access to it (e.g., via readthedocs.io), as well as a proper website is still missing, but there are some indications that help will come.
How many users there would have been by now had the documentation been better is anyone's guess. Thus, it is one of the main points needing attention.

Usability Details:
As it is middleware the intended audience is very minimal and there is no user interface to speak of.
End of Life:
None.
Standards:
OMG DDS:
DCPS specification version 1.4 (with a more friendly API)
DDSI specification version 2.3
Communities:
This release is specifically aimed at matching the upcoming "
Foxy Fitzroy
" release of ROS2, where Cyclone DDS is one of 3 tier-1 middleware options. We're quite proud of this: at the time of the initial release of "Dashing" there was no support for Cyclone DDS at all, both other tier-1 middleware options were there from the beginning, and no other newcomers have even made it to tier-2.
The tireless promotion of Cyclone DDS in the ROS2 community by Mr. Joe Speed (in particular) has dramatically increased visibility and use of Cyclone DDS. Some rather well-known companies have chosen to use Cyclone DDS over the incumbent middleware implementations in the ROS2 ecosystem (https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/?#iot.cyclonedds).
All this has led to more community involvement and more contributions from people outside the original circle. Examples include a port to a research operating system and fuzzing it to find bugs (the two bugs reported had both been discovered and fixed independently, fortunately).

There no compatibility issues with, except for one small change in the creation of "topic" entities. The "create topic" and "find topic" operations now create a new entity (thus with a unique handle), matching the DDS specification. Previously these would simply return the existing one when the topic was already known. This only substantially affects programs that:
call these operations in a loop for a single topic (this will now leak memory);
deliberately delete a topic after calling these operations multiple times for that topic with the aim of recreating it with a different QoS (because the topic now remains in existence, this now results in a subsequent dds_create_topic failing with an incompatible QoS error);
call these operations multiple times for a single topic and compare topic handles of readers/writers (because the handles are now no longer guaranteed to be the same).
The three cases above are deemed sufficiently rare that the change in behaviour is warranted within a single major version. Indeed, one could even argue this is merely a bug fix.
Target Environments:
Cyclone DDS's own CI on travis ensures compatibility with Windows, Linux and macOS on x64. The integration in ROS2 means 32-bit and 64-bit Linux on ARM are tested daily as well. Solaris, FreeRTOS, VxWorks, *BSD and Android are known to work.

Description:
Major features
Support for ROS2 Dashing and Eloquent (via an adaption layer), with very positive response from various members in the ROS2 community.
Support for an arbitrary number of concurrent DDS domains (fully independent instantiations of DDS) in a single process — this is a common feature for DDS implementations, but involved quite a bit of surgery for Cyclone DDS because of its heritage.
Abstracting the notion of samples, types and reader history caches, allowing overriding the default implementations of these to get behaviours more suited to the applications. This is particularly relevant to language bindings and embedding Cyclone DDS in other frameworks, such as ROS2.
Platform support is extended beyond the usual Linux/Windows/macOS: FreeRTOS, Solaris 2.6 are now known to work, with CI builds for FreeRTOS-simulator-on-Linux expected to be in before the release is planned.
A variety of bug fixes, static analysis and test coverage improvements, and small usability enhancements.
On the proposed version number
The jump to 0.5 is because I have received some comments that "0.1" (and hence "0.2") makes Cyclone DDS look much less mature than it really is. I personally think that should not carry too much weight, but in the naming scheme following the movements of Schumann's Carnaval, 5 maps nicely to the calm and deliberate "Eusebius" — and this is a time to steadily move forward with considered steps. Obviously "1.0" would be a nicer version number still, but I do not believe that is a sensible step just yet:
Some parts of the API need a revision and while the changes will be minor, it appears likely that it will require updating application code. That change should be done before (or coinciding with) releasing 1.0.
Two key features are not in place yet: an implementation of the DDS Security specification, and support for what the specification calls "transient data", that is, data managed by the infrastructure and remaining available to new subscribers even when the original publishers have terminated. Given these efforts are progressing, it is again not a good time to think of releasing 1.0.

Fully backwards compatible with the following exceptions:
a change in how implicitly created ("publisher" and "subscriber") entities are handled: they now never lose their "implicitness", and in consequence, are now deleted when their last child disappears rather than deleted when their one child disappears;
the set of entities that can be attached to a waitset is now restricted to those owned by the parent of the waitset, before one was allowed to attach entities from different participants to the same waitset, which is tantamount to a bug;
a participant entity now has a participant, so the "get_parent" operation no longer returns 0 for a participant because of the addition of two additional levels to the entity hierarchy: a domain, possibly containing multiple participants; and one that represents the entire library;
the data from a reader for a built-in topic has been extended, breaking binary compatibility.
Acceptance of some malformed messages from certain implementations improved interoperability on the wire.
Internationalization:
None. Given that Cyclone DDS is a middleware library aimed at developers, the absence of translations is not believed to be an obstacle to adoption, and besides the active people would not be able to do much in the way of internationalisation ...
Target Environments:
Tier 1 platforms are Linux, macOS and Windows, and FreeRTOS is also supported. It is known to work on Solaris 2.6 and believed to be easy to port to most platforms, including many embedded ones.
Hardware dependency is limited to endianness (because of serialisation formats) and the availability of atomic operations. It is tested/known to work on x86, ARM and SPARC (in 32 and 64-bit variants), and so there is no reason to expect any problems on other common CPU architectures (e.g., PowerPC, MIPS, RISC-V).
There is a dependency on Java for preprocessing IDL and generating instructions for the serialiser, and additionally on Maven for building this preprocessor. Various people have raised concerns on this dependency, and work is underway to eliminate it by replacing the current, Java-based pre-processor by one written in C.
Language bindings are currently still limited to C, but a C++ is known to exist and expected to be donated quickly on the heels of this new preprocessor.
