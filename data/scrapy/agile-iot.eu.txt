AGILE IoT Project
AGILE (Adaptive Gateways for dIverse muLtiple Environments) builds a modular hardware and software gateway for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT apps execution, and external Cloud communication, featuring diverse pilot activities, Open Calls & Community building.
Modularity & Adaptability
AGILE builds a modular and adaptive gateway for IoT devices. Modularity at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired IoT networking technologies (e.g. KNX, ZWave, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, etc.) and allows fast prototyping of IoT solutions for various domains (e.g. home automation, environment monitoring, wearables, etc.). At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally. The AGILE software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps are recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.
Open Source
All AGILE software modules will be delivered as 100% Open Source, with the majority of them becoming part of a new Eclipse Foundation IoT Project. The objective is to provide IoT developers and communities with software components for effective and agile IoT prototyping, and at the same time to establish a community of users and developers, maximizing the adoption of the AGILE Project.
Diverse Pilots
AGILE will run five pilots by QuantifiedSelf from wearables for self-tracking, and open air crop and livestock monitoring using drones, to smart retail solutions for enhanced shopping experiences. These pilots will both demonstrate the applicability of the hardware and software in managing IoT devices and creating applications and sharing data, and will set the foundations for further commercial exploitation of the Project and innovations.
An IoT Testbed
AGILE will become part of the existing IoT-Lab infrastructure in France managed by INRIA. With more than 2500 sensors deployed in 5 locations, AGILE users will have the opportunity to evaluate their IoT applications in real environments, collect and store sensor data, and interact with real devices.
Benefits for IoT companies and Projects
SMEs and Startups active in the IoT domain will have the opportunity to build products and services on top of AGILE hardware and software. Through two open calls that will take place during the Project lifetime, participants will be able to receive funding (up to 50k each) for building hardware and software on top of AGILE components. Partners like the Startupbootcamp IoT Program, will ensure that the call’s dissemination reaches the maximum participation of startups and innovators.
A complete IoT Ecosystem
AGILE creates IoT hardware and software components for multiple stakeholders.
IoT makers and developers who wish to quickly prototype solutions for managing IoT devices and data
End users with no experience in coding or setting up IoT hardware
Industry vendors seeking a modular gateway option that saves time in development and production
IoT entrepreneurs and SMEs who are building IoT solutions that need support of multiple protocols and networks.

Project has delivered exceptional results with significant immediate or potential impact !
Posted on
4th April 2019
4th April 2019
Taking someone else’s place is never easy, especially when you are the project manager of a big H2020 EU project like AGILE (www.agile-iot.eu). However, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the exceptional people that are part of a great consortium (the researchers, developers, biz guys, who I now call friends), I can say that WE did it very well! To be clear, I was already aware of that, but to read the conclusion of the official final review from the EU Commission which says “
Project has delivered exceptional results with significant immediate or potential impact
” is priceless!!!
So now you are probably wondering what’s next, right? As I mentioned earlier, it’s time to say goodbye to AGILE ☹
This amazing project has run its course, as it happens to all EU projects. But (now you know that) AGILE is not just another EU project. This is one more thing that makes it unique. AGILE is not dead! It has simply changed its name into ECLIPSE AGAIL. From now on, it will be fully Open Source and hosted by the Eclipse IoT Working group.
Long live ECLIPSE AGAIL!

Goodbye AGILE… Welcome AGAIL!
Posted on
28th January 2019
1st March 2019
The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the
Eclipse AGAIL open source project
. Don’t hesitate to try it, adopt it and contribute back to it!

Gateway Security, Data Provenance & Access Control (WP5)
D5.3 Secure Data Sharing
Data sharing is a key element of IoT environments; however, security and privacy concerns can diminish the potential of certain applications as users are reluctant to give data to third parties unconditionally. This deliverable describes how the AGILE security framework supports data sharing mechanisms while offering security assurances to users storing information on the gateway or sharing it with external systems.
First of all we explain enforcement mechanisms applied within the gateway. Those include enforcement points to ensure authorised access to container APIs, encryption of data stored within the gateway, and a policy decision point that can be used from applications running within or outside of the gateway.
Afterward, we explain mechanisms supporting use cases when data needs to be sent or received to/from external systems. For instance, AGILE offers a one-time token mechanism allowing external devices to authenticate in a lightweight manner towards the gateway. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in resource constrained devices, we implemented the client-side mechanism to generate tokens on RIOT (an OS for the IoT).
With regard to outsourcing data to external systems, we developed an SQL connector. This connector allows AGILE users to apply policies based on tables and actions performed on them when an application executes database queries. More importantly, when used in combination with CryptDB (an existing encrypted database), this connector can be used to offload data storage and querying computational resources to more powerful servers, yet without letting the external service to see the data in plain text. This is possible because information is encrypted before it is shared with external services.
To offer a wide range of integration possibilities, we do not only describe how to interact with a structured query language in a secure manner; on the contrary, we also include an approach that enables developers to apply policies on any kind of data they need to process. To this end, we created a sample application that is easily extensible and documents how to use the policy decision points from AGILE in different scenarios. These scenarios range from operating on an in-memory array of objects to obtaining information from external HTTP endpoints, e.g. github API, and applying policies on it.

D5.2 Usage Control and Provenance Management
This document discusses the goal of usage control and monitoring of security-sensitive actions executed on the gateway.
This deliverable describes how usage control and monitoring is achieved through the implementation of the AGILE security architecture. To this end, the security architecture is placed in the big picture of the AGILE project, and the location of the enforcement points required to achieve proper access and usage control of the data is covered herein. Additionally, this report illustrates how monitoring of actions to track provenance of data access gives insights to security-aware users on how systems interacting with the gateway APIs act on their behalf and access their data.
From the technical perspective, the policy language used by AGILE and the evaluation of the security policies with their dimensions are discussed. Later sections describe how the desired role-based access control model presented in earlier deliverables has been implemented on top of our generic attribute-based security architecture. More importantly, this document clarifies how the role-based access control currently configured by default for the gateway is realised by explaining entity definitions and their policies. The aforementioned role-based access control mechanisms serve as the foundation to apply policies capable of ensuring proper usage control on the gateway’s data. This takes place through a flexible policy framework implemented based on usage lock policies.

AirEx – Smart ventilation control to balance energy efficiency with air-exchange
Posted on
28th January 2019
28th January 2019
AirEx
is a novel
smart home technology
that helps reducing the home’s heat demand, without compromising moisture build-up and subsequently damp and indoor air quality. AirEx uses smart sensors to monitor and analyse environmental conditions while its cloud-based algorithms determine the vent state to automatically regulate airflow. It uses AI to predict occupants’ behaviour and weather patterns for more efficient airflow optimisation. Via improved thermal efficiency of the building fabric,
the system can reduce heating energy bills by 15%
, which means 2-3 years payback. AirEx’s key customers are
Social Housing Associations
who have the mandate to improve the energy efficiency of their building stock.
Within the scope of Agile IoT project, we had the opportunity to develop standard APIs using Agile IoT to interact to our product, AirEx and make it therefore
more agnostic
with regards to integration with third party connected devices and infrastructure. During this project the key component we utilised is ‘Connectivity and Communication Protocols’, where we managed to extend this component via implementing agile-rfm69 protocol to communicate using
HopeRF RFM69 module

Taking someone else’s place is never easy, especially when you are the project manager of a big H2020 EU project like AGILE (www.agile-iot.eu). However, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the exceptional people that are part of a great consortium (the researchers, developers, biz guys, who I now call friends), I can say that WE did it very well! To be clear, I was already aware of that, but to read the conclusion of the official final review from the EU Commission which says “
Project has delivered exceptional results with significant immediate or potential impact
” is priceless!!!
So now you are probably wondering what’s next, right? As I mentioned earlier, it’s time to say goodbye to AGILE ☹
This amazing project has run its course, as it happens to all EU projects. But (now you know that) AGILE is not just another EU project. This is one more thing that makes it unique. AGILE is not dead! It has simply changed its name into ECLIPSE AGAIL. From now on, it will be fully Open Source and hosted by the Eclipse IoT Working group.
Long live ECLIPSE AGAIL!
Feel free to try it, adopt it and contribute back to it here:

We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.
Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.
The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.
In the future we are keen to continue to use Agile-BLE in order to integrate additional sensors. In addition, once the Agile hub becomes LoRaWAN-enabled we will be very keen to explore the possibility of using Agile hub.
Our Software Lead is presenting some of the key outcomes of the project via this IoT Webinar:

The goal of this deliverable is to provide a baseline for the exploitation management of AGILE. In this first iteration, the focus is on the innovation potential the individual project partners see for AGILE as an opportunity to explore alternative exploitation and monetization paths, or to enhance existing ones. In order to achieve a structured overview, a business model validation tool is introduced and applied to each participating partner in AGILE. The tool identifies each partners’ envisaged customer segments, their common need, the value promise of the solution, the technical aspects involved, the value network of stakeholders, the identifiable competition and the potential financial model. Each of these aspects is briefly explained with the goal of providing a starting point for later iterations of this deliverable.
The initial conclusions show that various partners in the project have compatible customer segments and value propositions that revolve around the AGILE solution. This compatibility is important, as it will allow individual partners to exploit results from the project in their respective businesses: it is clear that the integrated solution that AGILE promises to be will be exploitable as such, but at the same time it will allow several partners to build on and exploit the results even without a further commercialised, integrated platform.

D6.1 Open Call Dissemination, Management & Submission Portal
D6.1 – Open Call Dissemination, Management & Submission Portal – was defined as being a website or part of a website linked to the main AGILE project website that will host all the information.
The information of the Open Call 1 is found on the homepage of the Agile IoT project: http://agile-iot.eu/
As part of this deliverable, a guide for applicants has been developed based on the internal call manual. This guide was also published on the call site.
Next to the information on the Agile IOT site, the site on F6S is used to gather and evaluate the proposals for the open calls: https://www.f6s.com/opencall1agile
All consortium partners were asked to assist in the dissemination of the open call in the respective markets where they are active. Eclipse foundation also helped spread the open call through their channels as part of their dissemination effort. Startupbootcamp IoT will promote the call worldwide through various dissemination channels (network of startups, IoT evens, etc.).

D6.5 Innovation and Exploitation Planning and Report
The goal of this deliverable is to provide an additional layer for the exploitation management of AGILE and enable exploitation planning. In this second iteration, the focus is put on the exploitation opportunities for each pilot conducted within AGILE to explore avenues for monetization and go-to-market strategies. To build up on the Business Modelling assessment from the first iteration of this deliverable, a stakeholder-based business modelling approach was chosen to define the business model scenarios of the single pilots as archetypes for AGILE exploitation possibilities. The approach defines the stakeholder environment in which the AGILE-driven solutions of the pilots are integrated and then defines which stakeholders could provide revenue to make the solution sustainable and which users would have to cooperate in order for the pilot-specific business models to be sustainable a the targeted market.
The business model solutions were drafted collaboratively in a workshop on the consortium meeting in Q1 2017 and refined afterwards. The initial conclusions from the business modelling exercise and following research show that each pilot has solid exploitation options and a variety of stakeholder that are likely to provide a sustainable inflow of revenue. The diversity of the pilot business models shows how flexibly AGILE can be deployed, without being limited to a specific application or a specific domain.

Kickstarter campaign
– but be quick, the campaign is only on for the month of November 2017.
Imagine being able to manage all your IoT devices from one place. The AGILE gateway helps you do that. With it you will be able to access and manage to your data locally, or send it to the cloud to check and share it wherever you are in the world!
Still not convinced? What if we told you that the most ambitious makers will also have the opportunity to create and run their own IoT apps through our visual environment and share them with the rest of our community!?
If you are getting started in the IoT world, you may think that this is not for you, since everything seems technical and complicated. Don’t worry, AGILE software can be auto-configured and adapted based on the hardware so that the entire setup is performed automatically for you! Forget about wiring, make it fast and easy, make it AGILE.
Do you want to take part in this wireless IoT movement? Join us in our
Kickstarter campaign
and acquire one of the IoT gateways. Influence the future of IoT thanks to this small contribution!
Why Crowdfunding?
The makers’ world is constantly moving, with various contributors, new creations, new development technologies, and in some cases, smarter devices that improve our daily lives. Crowdfunding campaigns help bring these ideas to life. They are created to help those without enough resources to make their ideas progress and make them successful. This isn’t always an easy path. Reaching an overwhelming victory depends solely on the supporters.
Despite the risk, we, the AGILE consortium members are launching this Kickstarter campaign! Our objective isn’t to fund the project itself, but to bring the Internet of Things (IoT) closer to the makers with the AGILE platform. We aim to put forth a solution that encompasses most of the IoT aspects on the market to impact the future of IoT.
More about the Campaign
You can only get these AGILE gateways in November 2017, while the campaign officially runs. We have defined some bundles to make it easier and personalized to various IoT projects. Pick the one that fits your project best! Here are the different kits:
What are the goals of this open source project and its Kickstarter campaign? They are simple and clear: to give the world the opportunity to get AGILE started with the IoT gateway, along with all the developed features that you will be able to find on
GitHub
.
It is not a matter of money, we only need 2300€ to launch this Kickstarter! Not that much for a crowdfunding campaign. We simply want our shield to spread among makers! In fact, all these bundles are offered at cost price, so this is a great opportunity.
Grab it while the units last!
Why do I need the AGILE shield?
You will get to use AGILE technology. This small shield will give you great possibilities. The usage and combinations only depends on your needs and creativity!
You will be able to combine up to two different communication modules, measure temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. Maybe you want to track your different AGILE gateways using the GPS signal? Guess what? That is also possible! Have a look at all the features:
I want to help you!
That is awesome! The easiest and fastest way to contribute is supporting our
Kickstarter campaign
400,000 €
. Maximum 8 companies will be selected for a sub-grant of
50,000 €
each.

The diversity of devices and connectivity networks in smart building can only grow with new and emerging devices that are entering the mainstream. To ensure future proof and sustainable deployment of smart buildings, there is a need to:
Transform the collected data into uniform data formats
ensuring their proper handling by applications and IoT platforms. By doing so, the management of the life cycle (changing device vendor or changing IoT platform provider) becomes an easy task for IoT project owners.
Process the data locally
and send only processed/filtered data to the cloud. Indeed, huge amounts of data sets could be generated. It is neither beneficial nor economically viable to send all the data to the cloud. Processing data locally is an emerging technical and business imperative. It is usually performed through running application logic closer to the IoT devices: i.e. where the data is generated.
Sensinov was selected for an open call of H2020 Agile IoT project. Our role in the project was to integrate Agile IoT gateways in the
Watson IoT platform
. This was an excellent opportunity for Sensinov to demonstrate its interoperability platform in action. Among our findings:
Agile IoT provides us a perfect development environment to cope with industrial IoT requirements from real life projects.
These requirements include
:
The management of diversity in IoT devices and protocols
The enhancement of efficiency through local processing
Device connectivity

Find a device named
CC2650 SensorTag
. It is your TI SensorTag.
Press the

It will automatically switch back to the DEVICES list and you should be able to see in the list your tag listed.
Click on the name
CC2650 SensorTag
to view the currently available features.
As you can see, the current implementation of this device covers only a subset of the feature actually provided by TI:
Maintaining appropriate conditions in the storage and transport of sensitive products is an age-old problem for
food supply chains
. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.
ISTMOS
monitoring platform allows the supply chain stakeholders of bottled wine to monitor the most critical parameters affecting wine quality during its storage and transportation. Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.
In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).
The results of the ISTMOS-AGILE integration have been evaluated through a pilot case study in collaboration with two large Greek wineries.
Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.

The main objective of the experiment considers the integration of
Senseioty
, the FlairBit
software
platform
to accelerate the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT)
Big Data Analytics
, with the
Agile IoT gateway
and services. This integration allows Senseioty to benefit in flexibility both in terms of
data ingestion and edge computing capabilities.
From a technical standpoint, joining the Agile-IoT ecosystem allowed FlairBit to benefit from the
many innovative services provided by the Agile-IoT platform that are also available in Senseioty
after the integration carried out in the proposed project. The Agile IoT gateway modularity and
compliance with many architectures at the hardware level provide support for various wireless
and wired IoT networking technologies. Senseioty benefits from these additional protocols as a
way to create new data sources and IoT connectors which in turn creates data diversity and
heterogeneity. These features allow to speed-up the development of the integrated solution and to
reduce the time-to-market for the applications built on-top-of Senseioty. We have also
benchmarked other gateways, but they usually lack the rapid and smooth integration of software components with third party systems.
In fact, at the software level, the Agile IoT stack provides data collection and management
capabilities on the gateway, an intuitive interface for device management, a visual workflow editor

for creating integration patterns with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for releasing the
resulting end-to-end applications. Senseioty generates data analytics applications and workflows
to be pushed as close as possible to the data sources and the devices, hence Agile IoT gateway represents
the perfect match to deploy secure, scalable and reliable Senseioty edge-computing applications.
The overall system resulting from the integration of the Agile IoT stack and Senseioty allows
application developers to rapidly create and deploy innovative IoT applications without the necessity to customize a given IoT platform which in turn,, saves development time and resources.
Moreover, FlairBit, as an IoT platform provider, can now benefit from the Agile IoT ecosystem as a
way to boost its user and developer base and create new revenue streams, since Senseioty can
now be exploited and used in innovative cross-domain applications.
Furthermore, , in accessing the Agile-IoT ecosystem, FlairBit benefits from the different competencies,
technologies, and use cases of the partners in the consortium. From a business perspective, it
allows the generation of partnership to speed-up the go-to-market strategy in new markets for FlairBit.
In fact, Agile-IoT provides an interoperability framework to enable IoT platforms to open up access
to their devices/services in a controlled and secure manner. This pursues the acquisition of new revenue
streams for offering added value services along with receiving missing ingredients that enrich
FlairBit business offerings.
To conclude, the open source software Agile-IoT consortium is developing with a business-friendly license that allows FlairBit’s Senseioty IoT platforms to be Agile-IoT compliant, and at the same time to remain proprietary which allows FlairBit to increase its own product value and unlocking potential businesses in new markets. Simultaneously, FlairBit open sourced software components extend the Agile IoT stack and enables Big-Data Analytics on-top-of Agile IoT gateway, based on open source technologies (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Beam).

Connect the output port of the
websocket
node to the input port of the
debug
node by dragging between the output port of one to the input port of the other.
You can already test this flow:
Press the
Deploy
button on the top right of the Node-RED editor.
The flow will have changed a bit: the
websocket
node informs you it is connected and the
debug
node is turned ON:
To see the log, click on the
debug
tab on the right part of the editor and you will see the displayed trace.
You can interrupt the log, not the flow, anytime by switching the
debug
node OFF and re-deploy the flow.

return msg;
Press the Done button to close the
editor.
Feel free to redirect the output port to the debug node to verify that the code you wrote extracts properly the value of the temperature.
This value will now be pushed to an MQTT broker on the cloud to be able to subscribe to this data stream from any MQTT client. To do that, an
MQTT out
node needs to be added to our current flow.
Double-click on the
MQTT out
node to edit it.
For the Server field, click on the pencil button to specify the MQTT broker you want to reach.
For the purpose of this Getting Started, we will designate the Eclipse IoT MQTT broker by specifying
iot.eclipse.org
in the
Server
field.
Leave the port number (1883) unchanged and close this dialog by pressing the
Add
button.
You should be back at the
MQTT out
node editor. On the Topic field, type the following topic name:
javaonedemo/agile/sensors/temperature

This ID could be simpler but we wanted to be able to reuse an existing ID.
MQTT client demo
, we have to use this syntax.
At this point name the node, for example,
iot.eclipse.org
, and close the editor by pressing the
Done
button.
You still need to connect to output port of your
node to the input port of the
MQTT out
node and you should be all set.
Now you can deploy the resulting flow by clicking
Deploy
on the top right and you should be all set.

. It will open a web page with the following dashboard:
If you warm up your TI SensorTag, the dashboard should display a new value.
You can also test this URL from your smartphone, you will be able to access to the same realtime value
If the UI doesn't behave as expected, maybe somebody else is already running this Getting Started. In this case, we recommend you to change the MQTT broker topic we defined in the previous section for something else. Actually, the only token you can really change in the provided syntax will be the "
agile
" name in "javaonedemo/
agile
/sensors/temperature". For example, you could change to "javaonedemo/
agile-01
/sensors/temperature". In this case, the URL to reach your temperature sensor will have to change as well for
https://iot.eclipse.org/java/demo/app/#/greenhouses/remote/
agile-01
. Don't forget to re-deploy your flow.
