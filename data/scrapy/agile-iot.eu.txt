AGILE IoT Project
AGILE (Adaptive Gateways for dIverse muLtiple Environments) builds a modular hardware and software gateway for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT apps execution, and external Cloud communication, featuring diverse pilot activities, Open Calls & Community building.
Modularity & Adaptability
AGILE builds a modular and adaptive gateway for IoT devices. Modularity at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired IoT networking technologies (e.g. KNX, ZWave, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, etc.) and allows fast prototyping of IoT solutions for various domains (e.g. home automation, environment monitoring, wearables, etc.). At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally. The AGILE software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps are recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.
Open Source
All AGILE software modules will be delivered as 100% Open Source, with the majority of them becoming part of a new Eclipse Foundation IoT Project. The objective is to provide IoT developers and communities with software components for effective and agile IoT prototyping, and at the same time to establish a community of users and developers, maximizing the adoption of the AGILE Project.
Diverse Pilots
AGILE will run five pilots by QuantifiedSelf from wearables for self-tracking, and open air crop and livestock monitoring using drones, to smart retail solutions for enhanced shopping experiences. These pilots will both demonstrate the applicability of the hardware and software in managing IoT devices and creating applications and sharing data, and will set the foundations for further commercial exploitation of the Project and innovations.
An IoT Testbed
AGILE will become part of the existing IoT-Lab infrastructure in France managed by INRIA. With more than 2500 sensors deployed in 5 locations, AGILE users will have the opportunity to evaluate their IoT applications in real environments, collect and store sensor data, and interact with real devices.
Benefits for IoT companies and Projects
SMEs and Startups active in the IoT domain will have the opportunity to build products and services on top of AGILE hardware and software. Through two open calls that will take place during the Project lifetime, participants will be able to receive funding (up to 50k each) for building hardware and software on top of AGILE components. Partners like the Startupbootcamp IoT Program, will ensure that the call’s dissemination reaches the maximum participation of startups and innovators.
A complete IoT Ecosystem
AGILE creates IoT hardware and software components for multiple stakeholders.
IoT makers and developers who wish to quickly prototype solutions for managing IoT devices and data
End users with no experience in coding or setting up IoT hardware
Industry vendors seeking a modular gateway option that saves time in development and production
IoT entrepreneurs and SMEs who are building IoT solutions that need support of multiple protocols and networks.

Taking someone else’s place is never easy, especially when you are the project manager of a big H2020 EU project like AGILE (www.agile-iot.eu). However, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the exceptional people that are part of a great consortium (the researchers, developers, biz guys, who I now call friends), I can say that WE did it very well! To be clear, I was already aware of that, but to read the conclusion of the official final review from the EU Commission which says “

First of all we explain enforcement mechanisms applied within the gateway. Those include enforcement points to ensure authorised access to container APIs, encryption of data stored within the gateway, and a policy decision point that can be used from applications running within or outside of the gateway.
Afterward, we explain mechanisms supporting use cases when data needs to be sent or received to/from external systems. For instance, AGILE offers a one-time token mechanism allowing external devices to authenticate in a lightweight manner towards the gateway. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in resource constrained devices, we implemented the client-side mechanism to generate tokens on RIOT (an OS for the IoT).
With regard to outsourcing data to external systems, we developed an SQL connector. This connector allows AGILE users to apply policies based on tables and actions performed on them when an application executes database queries. More importantly, when used in combination with CryptDB (an existing encrypted database), this connector can be used to offload data storage and querying computational resources to more powerful servers, yet without letting the external service to see the data in plain text. This is possible because information is encrypted before it is shared with external services.
To offer a wide range of integration possibilities, we do not only describe how to interact with a structured query language in a secure manner; on the contrary, we also include an approach that enables developers to apply policies on any kind of data they need to process. To this end, we created a sample application that is easily extensible and documents how to use the policy decision points from AGILE in different scenarios. These scenarios range from operating on an in-memory array of objects to obtaining information from external HTTP endpoints, e.g. github API, and applying policies on it.

D5.2 Usage Control and Provenance Management
This document discusses the goal of usage control and monitoring of security-sensitive actions executed on the gateway.
This deliverable describes how usage control and monitoring is achieved through the implementation of the AGILE security architecture. To this end, the security architecture is placed in the big picture of the AGILE project, and the location of the enforcement points required to achieve proper access and usage control of the data is covered herein. Additionally, this report illustrates how monitoring of actions to track provenance of data access gives insights to security-aware users on how systems interacting with the gateway APIs act on their behalf and access their data.
From the technical perspective, the policy language used by AGILE and the evaluation of the security policies with their dimensions are discussed. Later sections describe how the desired role-based access control model presented in earlier deliverables has been implemented on top of our generic attribute-based security architecture. More importantly, this document clarifies how the role-based access control currently configured by default for the gateway is realised by explaining entity definitions and their policies. The aforementioned role-based access control mechanisms serve as the foundation to apply policies capable of ensuring proper usage control on the gateway’s data. This takes place through a flexible policy framework implemented based on usage lock policies.

So now you are probably wondering what’s next, right? As I mentioned earlier, it’s time to say goodbye to AGILE ☹
This amazing project has run its course, as it happens to all EU projects. But (now you know that) AGILE is not just another EU project. This is one more thing that makes it unique. AGILE is not dead! It has simply changed its name into ECLIPSE AGAIL. From now on, it will be fully Open Source and hosted by the Eclipse IoT Working group.
Long live ECLIPSE AGAIL!

D6.4 Innovation and Exploitation Report 1
The goal of this deliverable is to provide a baseline for the exploitation management of AGILE. In this first iteration, the focus is on the innovation potential the individual project partners see for AGILE as an opportunity to explore alternative exploitation and monetization paths, or to enhance existing ones. In order to achieve a structured overview, a business model validation tool is introduced and applied to each participating partner in AGILE. The tool identifies each partners’ envisaged customer segments, their common need, the value promise of the solution, the technical aspects involved, the value network of stakeholders, the identifiable competition and the potential financial model. Each of these aspects is briefly explained with the goal of providing a starting point for later iterations of this deliverable.
The initial conclusions show that various partners in the project have compatible customer segments and value propositions that revolve around the AGILE solution. This compatibility is important, as it will allow individual partners to exploit results from the project in their respective businesses: it is clear that the integrated solution that AGILE promises to be will be exploitable as such, but at the same time it will allow several partners to build on and exploit the results even without a further commercialised, integrated platform.

D6.1 – Open Call Dissemination, Management & Submission Portal – was defined as being a website or part of a website linked to the main AGILE project website that will host all the information.
The information of the Open Call 1 is found on the homepage of the Agile IoT project: http://agile-iot.eu/
As part of this deliverable, a guide for applicants has been developed based on the internal call manual. This guide was also published on the call site.
Next to the information on the Agile IOT site, the site on F6S is used to gather and evaluate the proposals for the open calls: https://www.f6s.com/opencall1agile
All consortium partners were asked to assist in the dissemination of the open call in the respective markets where they are active. Eclipse foundation also helped spread the open call through their channels as part of their dissemination effort. Startupbootcamp IoT will promote the call worldwide through various dissemination channels (network of startups, IoT evens, etc.).

The goal of this deliverable is to provide an additional layer for the exploitation management of AGILE and enable exploitation planning. In this second iteration, the focus is put on the exploitation opportunities for each pilot conducted within AGILE to explore avenues for monetization and go-to-market strategies. To build up on the Business Modelling assessment from the first iteration of this deliverable, a stakeholder-based business modelling approach was chosen to define the business model scenarios of the single pilots as archetypes for AGILE exploitation possibilities. The approach defines the stakeholder environment in which the AGILE-driven solutions of the pilots are integrated and then defines which stakeholders could provide revenue to make the solution sustainable and which users would have to cooperate in order for the pilot-specific business models to be sustainable a the targeted market.
The business model solutions were drafted collaboratively in a workshop on the consortium meeting in Q1 2017 and refined afterwards. The initial conclusions from the business modelling exercise and following research show that each pilot has solid exploitation options and a variety of stakeholder that are likely to provide a sustainable inflow of revenue. The diversity of the pilot business models shows how flexibly AGILE can be deployed, without being limited to a specific application or a specific domain.

The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the
Eclipse AGAIL open source project
. Don’t hesitate to try it, adopt it and contribute back to it!

Project Coordinator of the AGILE project

AirEx – Smart ventilation control to balance energy efficiency with air-exchange
Posted on
28th January 2019
28th January 2019
AirEx
is a novel
smart home technology
that helps reducing the home’s heat demand, without compromising moisture build-up and subsequently damp and indoor air quality. AirEx uses smart sensors to monitor and analyse environmental conditions while its cloud-based algorithms determine the vent state to automatically regulate airflow. It uses AI to predict occupants’ behaviour and weather patterns for more efficient airflow optimisation. Via improved thermal efficiency of the building fabric,
the system can reduce heating energy bills by 15%
, which means 2-3 years payback. AirEx’s key customers are

You want to contribute to new technologies, but you don’t know where to start? You want to be the pioneer in your sector and get ahead of the competition? Great news! You can do all that with AGILE.
We have developed a maker-friendly IoT gateway that will help get you to the forefront of IoT communications. This open source device has huge potential and you can now get one by supporting our
Kickstarter campaign
– but be quick, the campaign is only on for the month of November 2017.
Imagine being able to manage all your IoT devices from one place. The AGILE gateway helps you do that. With it you will be able to access and manage to your data locally, or send it to the cloud to check and share it wherever you are in the world!
Still not convinced? What if we told you that the most ambitious makers will also have the opportunity to create and run their own IoT apps through our visual environment and share them with the rest of our community!?
If you are getting started in the IoT world, you may think that this is not for you, since everything seems technical and complicated. Don’t worry, AGILE software can be auto-configured and adapted based on the hardware so that the entire setup is performed automatically for you! Forget about wiring, make it fast and easy, make it AGILE.
Do you want to take part in this wireless IoT movement? Join us in our
Kickstarter campaign
and acquire one of the IoT gateways. Influence the future of IoT thanks to this small contribution!

who have the mandate to improve the energy efficiency of their building stock.
Within the scope of Agile IoT project, we had the opportunity to develop standard APIs using Agile IoT to interact to our product, AirEx and make it therefore
more agnostic
with regards to integration with third party connected devices and infrastructure. During this project the key component we utilised is ‘Connectivity and Communication Protocols’, where we managed to extend this component via implementing agile-rfm69 protocol to communicate using
HopeRF RFM69 module
.
We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.
Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.
The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.
In the future we are keen to continue to use Agile-BLE in order to integrate additional sensors. In addition, once the Agile hub becomes LoRaWAN-enabled we will be very keen to explore the possibility of using Agile hub.
Our Software Lead is presenting some of the key outcomes of the project via this IoT Webinar:

Why Crowdfunding?
The makers’ world is constantly moving, with various contributors, new creations, new development technologies, and in some cases, smarter devices that improve our daily lives. Crowdfunding campaigns help bring these ideas to life. They are created to help those without enough resources to make their ideas progress and make them successful. This isn’t always an easy path. Reaching an overwhelming victory depends solely on the supporters.
Despite the risk, we, the AGILE consortium members are launching this Kickstarter campaign! Our objective isn’t to fund the project itself, but to bring the Internet of Things (IoT) closer to the makers with the AGILE platform. We aim to put forth a solution that encompasses most of the IoT aspects on the market to impact the future of IoT.
More about the Campaign
You can only get these AGILE gateways in November 2017, while the campaign officially runs. We have defined some bundles to make it easier and personalized to various IoT projects. Pick the one that fits your project best! Here are the different kits:
What are the goals of this open source project and its Kickstarter campaign? They are simple and clear: to give the world the opportunity to get AGILE started with the IoT gateway, along with all the developed features that you will be able to find on
GitHub
.
It is not a matter of money, we only need 2300€ to launch this Kickstarter! Not that much for a crowdfunding campaign. We simply want our shield to spread among makers! In fact, all these bundles are offered at cost price, so this is a great opportunity.
Grab it while the units last!
Why do I need the AGILE shield?
You will get to use AGILE technology. This small shield will give you great possibilities. The usage and combinations only depends on your needs and creativity!
You will be able to combine up to two different communication modules, measure temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. Maybe you want to track your different AGILE gateways using the GPS signal? Guess what? That is also possible! Have a look at all the features:
I want to help you!
That is awesome! The easiest and fastest way to contribute is supporting our
Kickstarter campaign
by the end of November 2017. Would you like to help us a bit more? You can also contribute with your time by spreading the word. Follow us on our different social networks and share our updates!

ensuring their proper handling by applications and IoT platforms. By doing so, the management of the life cycle (changing device vendor or changing IoT platform provider) becomes an easy task for IoT project owners.
Process the data locally
and send only processed/filtered data to the cloud. Indeed, huge amounts of data sets could be generated. It is neither beneficial nor economically viable to send all the data to the cloud. Processing data locally is an emerging technical and business imperative. It is usually performed through running application logic closer to the IoT devices: i.e. where the data is generated.
Sensinov was selected for an open call of H2020 Agile IoT project. Our role in the project was to integrate Agile IoT gateways in the
Watson IoT platform
. This was an excellent opportunity for Sensinov to demonstrate its interoperability platform in action. Among our findings:
Agile IoT provides us a perfect development environment to cope with industrial IoT requirements from real life projects.
These requirements include
:
The management of diversity in IoT devices and protocols
The enhancement of efficiency through local processing
Device connectivity
Protocol adaptation
Data processing close to the devices
Securing IoT communications
Ensuring system extensibility through the installation of new applications
As a smart building specialist without any plan to build hardware, Agile IoT provides a perfect solution for deployment scenarios where the need to add a gateway is necessary with the absence of local and extensible local processing capabilities. Sensinov is currently considering the inclusion of an Agile IoT compatible gateway in its portfolio, partnering with a hardware player who adheres to the Agile IoT principles. In interest to our roadmap and strategy, Agile IoT offers us several interesting value propositions including:
A rich set of connectors (Enocean, ZWave, ZigBee, BLE, etc)
An open source approach which avoids lock-in for Sensinov as a provider and for our customers
Press the
Start
button to start scanning your network.
When the scan is finished, you should be able to retrieve the IP address of your Raspberry Pi in the provided list.
If the application cannot find a RPi on your LAN, please verify you correctly installed the microSD card and you are correctly connected to your LAN.
Access to the AGILE Web UI
AGILE Welcome page
Now that you know the IP address of the RPi, you can connect to it by launching the AGILE Web UI.
Open a web browser and access to the following URL:
http://<rpi.ip>:8000
replace <rpi.ip> by the IP address you got on the previous step.
In this case, use the following URL:

Monitoring the Supply Chain of Bottled Wine with AGILE
Posted on
8th December 2018
8th December 2018
Maintaining appropriate conditions in the storage and transport of sensitive products is an age-old problem for
food supply chains
. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.
ISTMOS
monitoring platform allows the supply chain stakeholders of bottled wine to monitor the most critical parameters affecting wine quality during its storage and transportation. Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.

About AGILE
AGILE (: an Adaptive & Modular Gateway for the IoT) is a modular hardware and software gateway for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT apps execution, and external Cloud communication, featuring diverse pilot activities, Open Calls & Community building.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.
In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).
The results of the ISTMOS-AGILE integration have been evaluated through a pilot case study in collaboration with two large Greek wineries.
Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.

Big Data Analytics
, with the
Agile IoT gateway
and services. This integration allows Senseioty to benefit in flexibility both in terms of
data ingestion and edge computing capabilities.
From a technical standpoint, joining the Agile-IoT ecosystem allowed FlairBit to benefit from the
many innovative services provided by the Agile-IoT platform that are also available in Senseioty
after the integration carried out in the proposed project. The Agile IoT gateway modularity and
compliance with many architectures at the hardware level provide support for various wireless
and wired IoT networking technologies. Senseioty benefits from these additional protocols as a
way to create new data sources and IoT connectors which in turn creates data diversity and
heterogeneity. These features allow to speed-up the development of the integrated solution and to
reduce the time-to-market for the applications built on-top-of Senseioty. We have also
benchmarked other gateways, but they usually lack the rapid and smooth integration of software components with third party systems.
In fact, at the software level, the Agile IoT stack provides data collection and management
capabilities on the gateway, an intuitive interface for device management, a visual workflow editor
for creating integration patterns with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for releasing the
resulting end-to-end applications. Senseioty generates data analytics applications and workflows
to be pushed as close as possible to the data sources and the devices, hence Agile IoT gateway represents
the perfect match to deploy secure, scalable and reliable Senseioty edge-computing applications.
The overall system resulting from the integration of the Agile IoT stack and Senseioty allows
application developers to rapidly create and deploy innovative IoT applications without the necessity to customize a given IoT platform which in turn,, saves development time and resources.
Now, create a Node-RED flow from scratch by connecting to a Web Socket gathering data from your BLE Sensor and sending them to a MQTT broker to be displayed on a web UI.
From the AGILE web UI, launch the Node-RED editor by selecting the menu item
Agile > NodeRed
.
Look for the
websocket
input node, on the left section.
Drag & Drop the
websocket
node into the current flow.
Double-click on the node you just dropped to edit it.
Select
Connect to
on the
Type
combo-box field.
To edit the
Path
, click on the pencil button; it will open a second editor to specify the WebSocket URL.
Type the following URL in the
Path
field:

Moreover, FlairBit, as an IoT platform provider, can now benefit from the Agile IoT ecosystem as a
way to boost its user and developer base and create new revenue streams, since Senseioty can
now be exploited and used in innovative cross-domain applications.
Furthermore, , in accessing the Agile-IoT ecosystem, FlairBit benefits from the different competencies,
technologies, and use cases of the partners in the consortium. From a business perspective, it
allows the generation of partnership to speed-up the go-to-market strategy in new markets for FlairBit.
In fact, Agile-IoT provides an interoperability framework to enable IoT platforms to open up access
to their devices/services in a controlled and secure manner. This pursues the acquisition of new revenue
streams for offering added value services along with receiving missing ingredients that enrich
FlairBit business offerings.
To conclude, the open source software Agile-IoT consortium is developing with a business-friendly license that allows FlairBit’s Senseioty IoT platforms to be Agile-IoT compliant, and at the same time to remain proprietary which allows FlairBit to increase its own product value and unlocking potential businesses in new markets. Simultaneously, FlairBit open sourced software components extend the Agile IoT stack and enables Big-Data Analytics on-top-of Agile IoT gateway, based on open source technologies (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Beam).

AGILE IoT Project
AGILE (Adaptive Gateways for dIverse muLtiple Environments) builds a modular hardware and software gateway for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT apps execution, and external Cloud communication, featuring diverse pilot activities, Open Calls & Community building.
Modularity & Adaptability
AGILE builds a modular and adaptive gateway for IoT devices. Modularity at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired IoT networking technologies (e.g. KNX, ZWave, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, etc.) and allows fast prototyping of IoT solutions for various domains (e.g. home automation, environment monitoring, wearables, etc.). At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally. The AGILE software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps are recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.

Open Source
All AGILE software modules will be delivered as 100% Open Source, with the majority of them becoming part of a new Eclipse Foundation IoT Project. The objective is to provide IoT developers and communities with software components for effective and agile IoT prototyping, and at the same time to establish a community of users and developers, maximizing the adoption of the AGILE Project.
Diverse Pilots
AGILE will run five pilots by QuantifiedSelf from wearables for self-tracking, and open air crop and livestock monitoring using drones, to smart retail solutions for enhanced shopping experiences. These pilots will both demonstrate the applicability of the hardware and software in managing IoT devices and creating applications and sharing data, and will set the foundations for further commercial exploitation of the Project and innovations.
An IoT Testbed
AGILE will become part of the existing IoT-Lab infrastructure in France managed by INRIA. With more than 2500 sensors deployed in 5 locations, AGILE users will have the opportunity to evaluate their IoT applications in real environments, collect and store sensor data, and interact with real devices.
Benefits for IoT companies and Projects
SMEs and Startups active in the IoT domain will have the opportunity to build products and services on top of AGILE hardware and software. Through two open calls that will take place during the Project lifetime, participants will be able to receive funding (up to 50k each) for building hardware and software on top of AGILE components. Partners like the Startupbootcamp IoT Program, will ensure that the call’s dissemination reaches the maximum participation of startups and innovators.
A complete IoT Ecosystem
AGILE creates IoT hardware and software components for multiple stakeholders.
IoT makers and developers who wish to quickly prototype solutions for managing IoT devices and data
End users with no experience in coding or setting up IoT hardware
Industry vendors seeking a modular gateway option that saves time in development and production
IoT entrepreneurs and SMEs who are building IoT solutions that need support of multiple protocols and networks.

Connect to the MQTT broker
At this point, the sample is collecting temperature data from the Sensor and it is sending them to a MQTT broker on the cloud.
Web interface
You can directly test if the sample works properly by opening this page from any web browser:
https://iot.eclipse.org/java/demo/app/#/greenhouses/remote/agile
. It will open a web page with the following dashboard:
If you warm up your TI SensorTag, the dashboard should display a new value.
You can also test this URL from your smartphone, you will be able to access to the same realtime value
If the UI doesn't behave as expected, maybe somebody else is already running this Getting Started. In this case, we recommend you to change the MQTT broker topic we defined in the previous section for something else.

AGILE Pilot: Open Field & Animal Monitoring
Posted on
17th June 2016
8th July 2016
Challenge
One of the challenges of living in countries with poor infrastructure, human inaccessible places, or areas of natural catastrophes is that more often than not, there is little or no Internet access. This restriction makes it challenging when trying to gather, arrange, and access data. You might ask why this data is important and how it would be used? Well, for starters it would help the residents align their resources, monitor live stock and protect endangered species.
Pilot Project
This pilot uses the Agile Gateway as a gateway between the Internet, when accessible, and an unmanned drone collecting various data spread out on large areas.

D2.1 Core requirements specification and IoT protocol integration
This report forms part of the contractual deliverables of the AGILE H2020 EC-funded project. It documents the results from the analysis of available IoT Standards and protocols (for IoT and Machine-to-Machine communication) that will be integrated within AGILE for maximising the connected device support and interoperability. Support of the selected protocols (for integration in various layers such as the operating system, device management and the userspace) is assessed for features such as device discovery, communication and, additionally, utilisation of external protocols (e.g. for messaging).
In addition, the deliverable illustrates a process for auto-configuring hardware modules within the gateway, focusing on the configuration steps required during the deployment of the gateway and on the resource optimisation at runtime. This will allow the AGILE gateway to be autoconfigured based on the application context and user preferences. A preliminary mechanism to implement the configurator service is documented herein. A more detailed documentation of the configuration, will be presented in deliverable D2.2 (initial version of Gateway Selfconfiguration, IoT Device discovery & Remote gateway management).

Gateway Security, Data Provenance & Access Control (WP5)
D5.3 Secure Data Sharing
Data sharing is a key element of IoT environments; however, security and privacy concerns can diminish the potential of certain applications as users are reluctant to give data to third parties unconditionally. This deliverable describes how the AGILE security framework supports data sharing mechanisms while offering security assurances to users storing information on the gateway or sharing it with external systems.
First of all we explain enforcement mechanisms applied within the gateway. Those include enforcement points to ensure authorised access to container APIs, encryption of data stored within the gateway, and a policy decision point that can be used from applications running within or outside of the gateway.
Afterward, we explain mechanisms supporting use cases when data needs to be sent or received to/from external systems. For instance, AGILE offers a one-time token mechanism allowing external devices to authenticate in a lightweight manner towards the gateway. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in resource constrained devices, we implemented the client-side mechanism to generate tokens on RIOT (an OS for the IoT).
With regard to outsourcing data to external systems, we developed an SQL connector. This connector allows AGILE users to apply policies based on tables and actions performed on them when an application executes database queries. More importantly, when used in combination with CryptDB (an existing encrypted database), this connector can be used to offload data storage and querying computational resources to more powerful servers, yet without letting the external service to see the data in plain text. This is possible because information is encrypted before it is shared with external services.
To offer a wide range of integration possibilities, we do not only describe how to interact with a structured query language in a secure manner; on the contrary, we also include an approach that enables developers to apply policies on any kind of data they need to process. To this end, we created a sample application that is easily extensible and documents how to use the policy decision points from AGILE in different scenarios. These scenarios range from operating on an in-memory array of objects to obtaining information from external HTTP endpoints, e.g. github API, and applying policies on it.

D5.2 Usage Control and Provenance Management
This document discusses the goal of usage control and monitoring of security-sensitive actions executed on the gateway.
This deliverable describes how usage control and monitoring is achieved through the implementation of the AGILE security architecture. To this end, the security architecture is placed in the big picture of the AGILE project, and the location of the enforcement points required to achieve proper access and usage control of the data is covered herein. Additionally, this report illustrates how monitoring of actions to track provenance of data access gives insights to security-aware users on how systems interacting with the gateway APIs act on their behalf and access their data.
From the technical perspective, the policy language used by AGILE and the evaluation of the security policies with their dimensions are discussed. Later sections describe how the desired role-based access control model presented in earlier deliverables has been implemented on top of our generic attribute-based security architecture. More importantly, this document clarifies how the role-based access control currently configured by default for the gateway is realised by explaining entity definitions and their policies. The aforementioned role-based access control mechanisms serve as the foundation to apply policies capable of ensuring proper usage control on the gateway’s data. This takes place through a flexible policy framework implemented based on usage lock policies.

D6.4 Innovation and Exploitation Report 1
The goal of this deliverable is to provide a baseline for the exploitation management of AGILE. In this first iteration, the focus is on the innovation potential the individual project partners see for AGILE as an opportunity to explore alternative exploitation and monetization paths, or to enhance existing ones. In order to achieve a structured overview, a business model validation tool is introduced and applied to each participating partner in AGILE. The tool identifies each partners’ envisaged customer segments, their common need, the value promise of the solution, the technical aspects involved, the value network of stakeholders, the identifiable competition and the potential financial model. Each of these aspects is briefly explained with the goal of providing a starting point for later iterations of this deliverable.
The initial conclusions show that various partners in the project have compatible customer segments and value propositions that revolve around the AGILE solution. This compatibility is important, as it will allow individual partners to exploit results from the project in their respective businesses: it is clear that the integrated solution that AGILE promises to be will be exploitable as such, but at the same time it will allow several partners to build on and exploit the results even without a further commercialised, integrated platform.

D6.5 Innovation and Exploitation Planning and Report
The goal of this deliverable is to provide an additional layer for the exploitation management of AGILE and enable exploitation planning. In this second iteration, the focus is put on the exploitation opportunities for each pilot conducted within AGILE to explore avenues for monetization and go-to-market strategies. To build up on the Business Modelling assessment from the first iteration of this deliverable, a stakeholder-based business modelling approach was chosen to define the business model scenarios of the single pilots as archetypes for AGILE exploitation possibilities. The approach defines the stakeholder environment in which the AGILE-driven solutions of the pilots are integrated and then defines which stakeholders could provide revenue to make the solution sustainable and which users would have to cooperate in order for the pilot-specific business models to be sustainable a the targeted market.
The business model solutions were drafted collaboratively in a workshop on the consortium meeting in Q1 2017 and refined afterwards. The initial conclusions from the business modelling exercise and following research show that each pilot has solid exploitation options and a variety of stakeholder that are likely to provide a sustainable inflow of revenue. The diversity of the pilot business models shows how flexibly AGILE can be deployed, without being limited to a specific application or a specific domain.

AirEx – Smart ventilation control to balance energy efficiency with air-exchange
Posted on
28th January 2019
28th January 2019
AirEx
is a novel
smart home technology
that helps reducing the home’s heat demand, without compromising moisture build-up and subsequently damp and indoor air quality. AirEx uses smart sensors to monitor and analyse environmental conditions while its cloud-based algorithms determine the vent state to automatically regulate airflow. It uses AI to predict occupants’ behaviour and weather patterns for more efficient airflow optimisation. Via improved thermal efficiency of the building fabric,
the system can reduce heating energy bills by 15%
, which means 2-3 years payback. AirEx’s key customers are
Social Housing Associations
who have the mandate to improve the energy efficiency of their building stock.
Within the scope of Agile IoT project, we had the opportunity to develop standard APIs using Agile IoT to interact to our product, AirEx and make it therefore
more agnostic
with regards to integration with third party connected devices and infrastructure. During this project the key component we utilised is ‘Connectivity and Communication Protocols’, where we managed to extend this component via implementing agile-rfm69 protocol to communicate using
HopeRF RFM69 module
.
We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.
Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.
The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.
In the future we are keen to continue to use Agile-BLE in order to integrate additional sensors. In addition, once the Agile hub becomes LoRaWAN-enabled we will be very keen to explore the possibility of using Agile hub.
Our Software Lead is presenting some of the key outcomes of the project via this IoT Webinar:

You want to contribute to new technologies, but you don’t know where to start? You want to be the pioneer in your sector and get ahead of the competition? Great news! You can do all that with AGILE.
We have developed a maker-friendly IoT gateway that will help get you to the forefront of IoT communications. This open source device has huge potential and you can now get one by supporting our
Kickstarter campaign
– but be quick, the campaign is only on for the month of November 2017.
Imagine being able to manage all your IoT devices from one place. The AGILE gateway helps you do that. With it you will be able to access and manage to your data locally, or send it to the cloud to check and share it wherever you are in the world!
Still not convinced? What if we told you that the most ambitious makers will also have the opportunity to create and run their own IoT apps through our visual environment and share them with the rest of our community!?
If you are getting started in the IoT world, you may think that this is not for you, since everything seems technical and complicated. Don’t worry, AGILE software can be auto-configured and adapted based on the hardware so that the entire setup is performed automatically for you! Forget about wiring, make it fast and easy, make it AGILE.
Do you want to take part in this wireless IoT movement? Join us in our
Kickstarter campaign
and acquire one of the IoT gateways. Influence the future of IoT thanks to this small contribution!
Why Crowdfunding?
The makers’ world is constantly moving, with various contributors, new creations, new development technologies, and in some cases, smarter devices that improve our daily lives. Crowdfunding campaigns help bring these ideas to life. They are created to help those without enough resources to make their ideas progress and make them successful. This isn’t always an easy path. Reaching an overwhelming victory depends solely on the supporters.
Despite the risk, we, the AGILE consortium members are launching this Kickstarter campaign! Our objective isn’t to fund the project itself, but to bring the Internet of Things (IoT) closer to the makers with the AGILE platform. We aim to put forth a solution that encompasses most of the IoT aspects on the market to impact the future of IoT.
More about the Campaign
You can only get these AGILE gateways in November 2017, while the campaign officially runs. We have defined some bundles to make it easier and personalized to various IoT projects. Pick the one that fits your project best! Here are the different kits:
What are the goals of this open source project and its Kickstarter campaign? They are simple and clear: to give the world the opportunity to get AGILE started with the IoT gateway, along with all the developed features that you will be able to find on
GitHub
.
It is not a matter of money, we only need 2300€ to launch this Kickstarter! Not that much for a crowdfunding campaign. We simply want our shield to spread among makers! In fact, all these bundles are offered at cost price, so this is a great opportunity.
Grab it while the units last!
Why do I need the AGILE shield?
You will get to use AGILE technology. This small shield will give you great possibilities. The usage and combinations only depends on your needs and creativity!
You will be able to combine up to two different communication modules, measure temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. Maybe you want to track your different AGILE gateways using the GPS signal? Guess what? That is also possible! Have a look at all the features:
I want to help you!
That is awesome! The easiest and fastest way to contribute is supporting our
Kickstarter campaign
by the end of November 2017. Would you like to help us a bit more? You can also contribute with your time by spreading the word. Follow us on our different social networks and share our updates! If you want to receive updates regarding our progress, software releases, case studies… You can also subscribe to the
AGILE Newsletter

. Open a console and try to ping it to verify that it's there. If the ping says it cannot resolve the agile name, it means that you will have to retrieve the IP address provided by the DHCP server of your LAN. To do that, you can either retrieve this information, if you have access to your DHCP server, or you can use
Angry IP Scanner
. Downloads are available for Mac, Linux and Windows.
Angry IP Scan result
Load and install
Angry IP Scanner
on your PC/laptop.
Launch the application.
Specify the IP range to scan on your LAN.
Press the
Start
button to start scanning your network.
When the scan is finished, you should be able to retrieve the IP address of your Raspberry Pi in the provided list.
If the application cannot find a RPi on your LAN, please verify you correctly installed the microSD card and you are correctly connected to your LAN.
Access to the AGILE Web UI
AGILE Welcome page
Now that you know the IP address of the RPi, you can connect to it by launching the AGILE Web UI.
Open a web browser and access to the following URL:

Overall goal
The goal of the open calls is to:
Field test the AGILE outcomes from a market exploitation and pragmatic development perspective,
maximize project impact by engaging external entities (startups and/or SMEs) to build solutions on top of AGILE software and hardware.
The second Agile IoT Open Call aims to foster and further the creation of an ecosystem surrounding the AGILE solutions. In particular from the hardware point of view, applicants will be required to exploit AGILE hardware modularity and extend its capabilities. From a software point of view, applicants will be required to exploit AGILE development environment and implement specific business logic, analytics software, new added value services, management and maintenance solutions, etc., which enhance their core value proposition in the IoT domain while also demonstrating value for usability of AGILE software solutions. Successful applicants may also extend the existing pilots with additional deployments and with the establishment of new ones.

Using the Policy Framework in your Application
Configuring
There are two files used by the agile-security docker container taking care of identity management, policy administration, and policy decision points. The two files are located in the DATA folder under security/agile-idm-core-conf.js and security/agile-ui-conf.js.
Bootstrapping problem
OAuth2 configurations and WebSecurity
Aspects related to authentication providers and Web Security is located on the agile-ui-conf file. To configure CORS domains to generate requests from the browser, enhance the list located under "cors" in the configuration file. This allows browser-side AJAX requests to agile-security from particular domains.
For authentication configuration (for configuring external providers) please see the following site
https://github.com/Agile-IoT/agile-security/blob/master/docs/authentication.md
Special keywords
Since the security component behaves as an OAuth2 server towards applications using AGILE, it needs to recognize which applications a which users are interacting with the gateway. What makes this hard is that agile-security needes to know the "public" hostname of the gateway to configure these properties. To this end we have enabled a keyword to use a hostname provided by the AGILE_HOST environment variable or by the /etc/hostname file from the host where the agile-security docker image is running (if the hostname file is mounted in the docker-compose file).
The keyword used to specify the security component to take the AGILE_HOST or the /etc/hostname information (with precedence as they have been mentioned) is
set-automatically
. So, as it can be observed in the client creation, the url for it is

If the UI doesn't behave as expected, maybe somebody else is already running this Getting Started. In this case, we recommend you to change the MQTT broker topic we defined in the previous section for something else. Actually, the only token you can really change in the provided syntax will be the "
agile
" name in "javaonedemo/
agile
/sensors/temperature". For example, you could change to "javaonedemo/
agile-01
/sensors/temperature". In this case, the URL to reach your temperature sensor will have to change as well for
https://iot.eclipse.org/java/demo/app/#/greenhouses/remote/
agile-01
. Don't forget to re-deploy your flow.

Compiling a single device
Sometimes it is necessary to add support for a single device in an already deployed system. Especially when deployment was done using dockerized containers, it is useful to be able to add a device to the system without rebuilding the containers. To add support, follow these steps:
1, Clone agile-core, which also contains the DeviceFactory with device implementations
Note: use recursive cloning, or `git submodule update —init`
2, Ensure build environment is installed and JAVA_HOME is set (compilation will fail if JAVA_HOME is unset with "fatal error: jni.h: No such file or directory").
3, Install build dependencies
4, Compile the DeviceFactory
5, Develop your own device code (e.g. MyDevice.java) based on some of the examples in src/main/java/org/eclipse/agail/device/instance/
6, Compile your own device into java class
7, Deploy this class in the plugin folder of an existing DeviceFactory

Security
Applications interacting with the AGILE stack should be integrated with the security framework.
From the authentication point of view, AGILE offers the possibility for an application to be registered as an OAuth2 client. Examples to use the different kinds of OAuth2 flows are available in an AGILE open source repository:
https://github.com/Agile-IoT/agile-idm-examples
. This is useful for applications that want to implement their own interfaces (graphical or not) on their own and interact with the AGILE API directly. However, there is also a possibility to embed a Web application directly in AGILE OSJS and leverage that AGILE OSJS has already authenticated the user.
For this there is a sample AGILE OSJS application that passes the authentication token to the backend of your application here:
https://github.com/agile-iot/agile-policy-sample
. Moreover, there is full-fledged application (including the backend) integrating security policies from the AGILE framework and getting the authentication token from OSJS here:
https://github.com/agile-iot/agile-policy-sample
Interact with Devices
A good starting point to implement your own application is to have a look at the SDK documentation here:
https://github.com/agile-iot/agile-sdk
Also, you could use directly the AGILE REST API

How do I have to plan the Commercial Development & Acceleration?
When do I start?
After the evaluation and selection have ended (scheduled for April 2018) for the selected projects from Open Call 2, and as to your individual project plan. Your plan defines a start and an end-date for your project, in a time span of 6 months after the signature of the sub-grant agreement with the Agile IoT project – our aim is to have all project start latest in January 2018.
Does Agile IoT define products that shall be developed?
No. We are open to any idea making use of AGILE IoT gateway in the context of the addressed business domain and promising a business value.
How many organisations should participate in an app development?
We are generally expecting that one entrepreneur or SME is applying for the sub-grant. However, this entrepreneur or SME could cooperate with other entrepreneurs or SMEs for development. These development partners should be named in the proposal and they must meet the same criteria as the proposer, which means that the must also be a SMEs in Europe or an associated country. Furthermore, they should directly carry out work under the supervision and responsibility of the proposing entrepreneur or SME (see also the question below on eligible costs).
Can we present two or more proposals for different products or applications?
No, we ask you to only submit your best proposal, the business idea that best fits the objectives of Agile IoT with the highest potential to succeed.
What is the available sub-grant for the product and go-to-market plan?
Within Agile IoT, we will limit the funding for one proposer to maximum 50,000 Euro in Open Call 2.
The approved budget (maximum 50 k euros) will be progressively granted during the course of the project: Selected proposers will receive maximum 10 k euros of their projected budget as an award for successfully completing this first stage. All teams are checked on progress in terms of tangible outcomes against the milestones projected in their approved Project Plans. If the check-up outcome is positive, the team is awarded maximum 15 k euros at the quarterly evaluation point. At the end of the project, the participants are evaluated on their final report that concerns two aspects mainly: the technology and the execution of the business plan. If the evaluation outcome is positive, the team is awarded the final budget of maximum 25 k euros.
What language should the proposal be submitted in?
Proposals should be submitted in ENGLISH.
How do I prove the technical excellence of my team?
The short presentation of your organisation needs to outline your key competencies and previous experience with respect to relevant implementations, projects and or products. Moreover, you need to provide short CVs of those individuals that will mainly work in your project – please do not put CVs of individuals that are finally not working or just with a minor role in your proposed work. Those CVs shall reflect their education and previous experiences that are relevant to the work proposed.

Revision history of "Getting started with AGILE" - AGILE IoT Wiki
How will my proposal be evaluated?
External evaluators will assess the proposals based on predefined evaluation criteria. Based on the evaluation results, proposals will be ranked and funded as long as funding is available and the quality of the proposals is above the defined thresholds.
Agile IoT submissions will be evaluated in a cross-regional review process. All submitted proposals will be reviewed remotely and scored by three evaluators. The 16 top ranked proposals (provided overall quality of submissions) will be invited to pitch to a panel of experts.
My proposal has been selected for funding, now what?
The Agile IoT project team will inform you and invite you to an individual kick-off meeting in December, to review and fine-tune your Project Plan when needed. The sub-grant agreement will be based upon this jointly reviewed project plan. As soon as this agreement is signed you can start your work, based on your project plan that will be used as an annex to the sub-grant agreement, detailing the technology dimension, the go to market activities and any other actions to achieve the final goal.
Who owns the Intellectual Property of the Software that my organisation develops?
You or your organisation owns the IPR.
Which are the general requirements of the apps to be developed?
They need to use AGILE IoT gateway technology/software.
Are there specific technical requirements?
For being eligible to ask for a sub-grant you need to use the AGILE IOT stack. Without this usage, your proposal cannot be considered for funding.
What support will be given to the developers selected in the open call?
The Agile IoT project will provide technical assistance in accessing and using AGILE IoT technologies.
When do I start?
Once Open Call 2 evaluation and selection has ended, all Project Plans accepted will have to start latest January 2018.
How many Projects does the project expect to fund?
For Open Call 2 eight (8) winners will be selected.
What support materials are available for proposers?
Proposer can use the Agile IoT call text and the guide for applicants. Moreover, there are diverse AGILE IoT resources explaining the technical dimension of the programme.

After the close of the call, the Agile IoT project will evaluate the proposals with the help of external experts. The proposals will be ranked and the top 16 ranked proposals will be invited for an e-pitch. In total 8 projects will be selected in Open Call 2. The winners of the pitch will be invited for an individual kick-off, reviewing the project plan and signing the sub-grant agreement (i.e. contract).
Do I need a VAT number?
In the event the Applicant has been accepted and, in order to receive and spend the funds, he/she will need to provide a VAT number and be compliant with regional and national security laws.
What has to be reported for a reimbursement of costs?
In order to get a full reimbursement of your costs, you will need to provide a quarterly overview of expenses in relation to your budget. Expenses not related to the Agile IOT budget will not be allowed. The documentation has to clearly list the delivered features in relation to your proposal, the annex to the contract. The product needs to be delivered in a way, that the Agile IOT project is able to test the developed features. If there is a need to present your source code for review the Agile IOT project will not disclose any intellectual property as far as required by your organisation.
What are eligible costs?
Only costs generated during the lifetime of the project can be eligible. Generally, costs must be actually incurred (actual costs). That means that they must be real and not estimated, budgeted or imputed.
Costs must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting and management principles and practices of the beneficiary. The accounting procedures used in the recording of costs and receipts shall respect the accounting rules of the State in which the beneficiary is established. The beneficiary’s internal accounting and auditing procedures must permit direct reconciliation of the costs and receipts declared in respect of the project with the corresponding financial documents.
Cost must be used for the sole purpose of achieving the objectives of the project and its expected results, in a manner consistent with the principles of economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. Finally, the costs must be indicated in the proposal and the annex to the sub-grant agreement.
Moreover, personnel costs are only the costs of the actual hours worked by the persons directly carrying out work under the project and shall reflect the total remuneration: salaries plus social security charges (holiday pay, pension contribution, health insurance, etc.) and other statutory costs included in the remuneration. Such persons must:
be directly hired by the participant in accordance with its national legislation,
be working under the sole technical supervision and responsibility of the latter, and
be remunerated in accordance with the normal practices of the participant.
A subcontractor (i.e. a third party which has entered into an agreement on business conditions with your organisation) is not considered eligible for realising your planned core work. Since a subcontractor that would carry out part of the work of the project would work without the direct supervision of your organisation and without a relationship of subordination, subcontracting can only be allowed for non-core task (e.g. creating a poster, events, communications) and which are of small amounts.
However, a small travel budget and dissemination material in order to present your project in the AGILE IOT events and Agile IOT project related activities would be eligible.
We would not recommend planning for equipment, since assuming a relatively short time period of the project, the time for depreciation would be expected too long. However, if you see an explicit need, please explain at sufficient detail in your proposal how the depreciation costs are accounted for enabling the external evaluators to assess the eligibility.
The following costs shall be considered as non-eligible and may not be charged to the project:
identifiable indirect taxes including value added tax,
duties,
interest owed,
provisions for possible future losses or charges,
exchange losses, cost related to return on capital,

costs declared or incurred, or reimbursed in respect of another project of the European Union,
debt and debt service charges, excessive or reckless expenditure.
What are the maximum reimbursement rates of eligible costs?
When planning your project and the related development efforts for realising the app, you can calculate with 100% reimbursement of person efforts (i.e. developer related actual salary plus employers share). On top of the personnel costs you can add 7% of overhead that would also be reimbursed.
Maximum 15% of your budget can be used for subcontracting
Travel costs could be reimbursed if they are directly required for being able to realise the app development and the go-to-market (e.g. travels to your business partners and potential customers). However, you would need to be prepared to explain the purpose and results.
Do I need to calculate travel costs and dissemination events?
Yes. Generally, a small budget for travel and dissemination materials shall be taken into account for being able to present your results in AGILE IOT related activities. In accordance with your proposed project, you could also plan for required travels as well as for the dissemination and preparation of app exploitation after your project ends. Moreover, we will also invite selected app developers to larger events for being able to disseminate to a large target audience.
The European Commission can ask for an audit
–
what does this mean?
It is neither explicitly planned, nor predefined, but the European Commission may, at any time during the implementation of the project and up to five years after the end of the project, ask for financial audits or technical audit/review to be carried out, by external auditors/ experts, or by the Commission services themselves including
OLAF
. You need to keep your contractual documents and documentation of results elaborated at the defined milestones and specifically those main milestones that served for the review of being able to decide on the reimbursement of costs.
What happens if I cannot accomplish the project in the planned time?
You will have to deliver your project as to your product plan. It is not possible to extend your project in time.
If you are not able to deliver in scope and time as to your project plan, you will get the possibility to justify the non-accomplishment in an Executive Project Management Board hearing. If its outcome is negative, you will no longer be eligible neither for further funding nor for participating to Agile IOT open calls and activities.
Can I ask for more information?
If you have specific technical requests for support/clarification, please register on the Agile IOT website or forums. For questions related to the open call, contact
opencall at agile-iot dot eu

AGILE
software on your
Raspberry Pi 3
. We will present:
How to install an image of AGILE on a Raspberry Pi (RPi).
This document should work on Mac, Linux or Windows. We made our best to always choose a feature or an application available on all 3 platforms.
How to discover and connect a
BLE
(Bluetooth Low Energy) device to the AGILE gateway
Finally, we will test the resulting connection by designing and deploying a
Node-RED
flow
System Requirements
What do you need to be able to install an run this Getting Started?
a PC or a laptop

Install an AGILE image
We have prepared an image of the AGILE software that contains all the software you need to run this Getting Started and can directly be deployed on a microSD card. This guide was prepared with the Raspbian based v0.3.3 image of AGILE, however, we advise to use the most recent version.
Download the AGILE image from the following link:
AGILE_SD_images
.
Google Drive will inform you that it can't scan this file for viruses. So you will have to trust us on this one ;-), and press the button
Download anyway
.
Google Drive security question
The AGILE image is compressed on a GZip format. Once the image is downloaded,
unzip it
with your favorite tool.

Connect your SD Reader containing your microSD card to your PC/laptop
To flash your microSD card, you can either
use your favorite microSD flashing tool,
learn from this page
RPi Easy SD Card Setup
,
use
Etcher by Resin.io
, the great open source SD burner developed by our project partner
Resin.io
.
In the next steps, we will describe how to use Etcher to flash your microSD card.
Download and install
Etcher by Resin.io
on your PC/laptop. This tool works on Mac, Linux and Windows.
Launch the Etcher application
The Etcher UI will ask you first to
select the image
(.img) you want to flash. Select the image you previously unzipped
Then the UI will ask you to
select the SD Reader
. Unless you have several SD readers connected to your machine, you should only have one choice.

Finally, press the
Flash!
button to start the transfer.
Etcher UI
Your OS will ask you, at least on MacOS, the Admin credential of your PC/laptop. Complete it to proceed with the burning process.
Go and grab a coffee. flashing your microSD card will take some time... ;-) Be patient.
Once the flash is complete, close the Etcher app and eject the SD card.
Once the the flashing is completed, eject the SD reader from your PC/laptop and remove the microSD card from the reader.
Verify that your RPi is turned OFF
Slide the microSD card into the RPi microSD driver.
Remark:
Feel free to rebuild this image using the latest AGILE code by following
these instructions
.
Run the sample
Setup your configuration
Macbook HW setup
Connect your RPi to the power supply.
You can directly connect it a USB port of your PC/laptop; the RPi will not consume too much power in this case.
Connect your RPi to your LAN.
You can connect it to your router/switch or, if you have the adapter, you can directly connect it to the RJ45 attached to your PC/laptop
Retrieve the IP address of your RPi
Your RPi should be declared on your LAN with the name
agilegw.local

. Open a console and try to ping it to verify that it's there. If the ping says it cannot resolve the agile name, it means that you will have to retrieve the IP address provided by the DHCP server of your LAN. To do that, you can either retrieve this information, if you have access to your DHCP server, or you can use
Angry IP Scanner
. Downloads are available for Mac, Linux and Windows.
Angry IP Scan result
Load and install
Angry IP Scanner
on your PC/laptop.
Launch the application.
Specify the IP range to scan on your LAN.
Press the
Start
button to start scanning your network.
When the scan is finished, you should be able to retrieve the IP address of your Raspberry Pi in the provided list.
If the application cannot find a RPi on your LAN, please verify you correctly installed the microSD card and you are correctly connected to your LAN.
Access to the AGILE Web UI
AGILE Welcome page
Now that you know the IP address of the RPi, you can connect to it by launching the AGILE Web UI.
Open a web browser and access to the following URL:
http://<rpi.ip>:8000
replace <rpi.ip> by the IP address you got on the previous step.
In this case, use the following URL:
http://agilegw.local:8000/

.
In the
Function
field, type the following JavaScript code:
var json = JSON.parse(msg.payload);
msg.payload = json.value;
return msg;
Press the Done button to close the
editor.
Feel free to redirect the output port to the debug node to verify that the code you wrote extracts properly the value of the temperature.
This value will now be pushed to an MQTT broker on the cloud to be able to subscribe to this data stream from any MQTT client. To do that, an
MQTT out
node needs to be added to our current flow.

Double-click on the
MQTT out
node to edit it.
For the Server field, click on the pencil button to specify the MQTT broker you want to reach.
For the purpose of this Getting Started, we will designate the Eclipse IoT MQTT broker by specifying
iot.eclipse.org
in the
Server
field.
Leave the port number (1883) unchanged and close this dialog by pressing the
Add
button.
You should be back at the
MQTT out
node editor. On the Topic field, type the following topic name:
javaonedemo/agile/sensors/temperature
This ID could be simpler but we wanted to be able to reuse an existing ID.
MQTT client demo
, we have to use this syntax.

At this point name the node, for example,
iot.eclipse.org
, and close the editor by pressing the
Done
button.
You still need to connect to output port of your
node to the input port of the
MQTT out
node and you should be all set.
Now you can deploy the resulting flow by clicking
Deploy
on the top right and you should be all set.
MQTT output node
MQTT node editor
Completed flow
Connect to the MQTT broker
At this point, the sample is collecting temperature data from the Sensor and it is sending them to a MQTT broker on the cloud.
Web interface
You can directly test if the sample works properly by opening this page from any web browser:
https://iot.eclipse.org/java/demo/app/#/greenhouses/remote/agile
. It will open a web page with the following dashboard:
If you warm up your TI SensorTag, the dashboard should display a new value.

You can also test this URL from your smartphone, you will be able to access to the same realtime value
If the UI doesn't behave as expected, maybe somebody else is already running this Getting Started. In this case, we recommend you to change the MQTT broker topic we defined in the previous section for something else. Actually, the only token you can really change in the provided syntax will be the "
agile
" name in "javaonedemo/
agile
/sensors/temperature". For example, you could change to "javaonedemo/
agile-01
/sensors/temperature". In this case, the URL to reach your temperature sensor will have to change as well for
https://iot.eclipse.org/java/demo/app/#/greenhouses/remote/
agile-01
. Don't forget to re-deploy your flow.

Providers of resin.io Technical contribution in AGILE software
Resin.io
has been working since the summer of 2013 on a revolutionary platform for
software deployment on embedded linux devices
, with applications on the Internet of Things. The platform aims to
bring deployment technology commonly used for servers in data centers into embedded linux devices located in any physical location
. The challenge is that these devices are

, have less reliable connections, and need to work within a much less predictable environment. In addition, installing and repairing the devices is significantly harder than servers which are concentrated in a well-managed data center.
The key innovation we built on is called
Linux Containers
. This technology consists of a number of capabilities that have been added to the Linux operating system kernel over the last few years, and allow for virtualization without computational overhead. This means that entire virtual machines can be run on a resource-limited device, such as a thermostat or medical device, allowing for easy updates without restarting the device, or risking damage to the ability for further remote operation in case of a faulty update. Linux Containers have become increasingly popular as a virtualization technique in data centers, with the arrival of the
Docker
open-source toolkit in May 2013, which encouraged an entire ecosystem of supporting products and projects to be created. Currently Docker is supported by Red Hat, Google, OpenStack, amongst many other partners.
The Docker toolkit however did not support CPUs with the ARM architecture which dominates small and embedded devices. Resin.io’s team made that breakthrough in November 2013 and was recognised by all related parties. We soon followed this breakthrough by achieving cross- compilation of containers on x86 servers, offering the speed and power of a data center, instead of using the slower ARM devices for the compilation step which can take hours depending on the payload. In January we released the first prototype of resin.io, our end-to-end service, which for the first time supports ‘git push’ deployment for embedded devices. This mechanism, invented by Linus Torvalds, author of the Linux OS, is now widespread for deployment to cloud services, but had never been used for embedded devices. We proceeded to adapt the
Boot2Docker
distribution of Linux to work on the Raspberry Pi single board computer and invent a new installer that makes the process much faster and less demanding of download bandwidth.
Having made these breakthroughs, the Resin.io team is now
a leader in virtualization technology for embedded devices
and are putting our full resource into completing our product, improving on the core technological differentiators we have invented, and partnering with interested technology companies to bring our platform to a wide array of users and use-cases.
Role in project
Our goal is to empower IoT Developers to write great applications for the physical world without having to worry about the friction involved in getting hardware working and keeping advanced, distributed applications up to date.
The company’s involvement will be in achieving both the initial design of the gateway software, e.g. for low-cost embedded devices, and also delivering the software stack and interface (UI and underlying components) for the management of devices and data from devices, as well as a streamlined Web-like development environment. Exploratory components include rule-based definition of notifications and actions, support for arbitrary devices as well as third-party extensions. Both research and development resource will be allocated to AGILE, for the duration of the project.

AGILE Workshop at EclipseCon France
Posted on
30th April 2018
30th April 2018
We are pleased to announce that we are organising an
AGILE Workshop
during the
Unconference event at EclipseCon France 2018
. It will take place on
June 12th
, from 14:00 to 17:00 at Hotel Pullman.

Using the AGILE framework to implement a Quantified Self application: Advantages and Challenges
Posted on
16th October 2017
16th October 2017
New biosensors are released daily promising to help us monitor important biosignal parameters. Until recently, lower priority has been given to interoperability while emphasis has been put on data collection, many times on remote servers without the level of guarantees that the user’s data will not be misused. The AGILE software stack with the component-based architecture and open source licensing and development model allows for the implementation of a fully-fledged gateway under the user’s control.
The proliferation of a multitude of biosignal sensors and activity trackers to gather user biosignal and wellness attributes poses unique challenges for their effective integration into user-centric applications which will provide valuable insights and promote healthy behaviors. Such sensors include
medical sensors
for biosignals such as heart-rate, oxygen saturation and weight, b)
trackers

Adaptation: Wow, What a GREAT event!
Posted on
24th July 2017
19th September 2017
We have been talking about this event
for months.
The Adaptation Exhibition finally come and gone, and it was GREAT!
I was a little bit nervous when I arrived in Berlin last week. Actually, I knew that when we selected the artistic projects last winter, that we were not really ready to share the AGILE code: the documentation was missing, the code was not stable, and the integration was not really effective. So, sharing the AGILE software in such context was risky, especially sharing it with people without a strong IoT background.
All the artists stepped up to the task with great artistic ideas and a technical person on their team. So, not only did they have the support of some AGILE partners like Libelium, BioAssist, or ATOS, but they also received everyday support from colleagues, friends and spouses.
The result is really interesting. Each artistic team put a piece of themselves in their project. These were expressed like so:
Fountains
–
tackled concern about water pollution
Still Touchable?
–
questioned our relationship with objects in a near future
E-Camera
–
enriched our photos with our own emotions
Floral Automaton
–
mimicked biological processes of our surroundings

FORSEC Published Book – AGILE Collaboration
Posted on
30th January 2018
30th January 2018
AGILE has collaborated with a Bavarian project called FORSEC. FORSEC has recently published a
book collecting their results
, in which they mention their collaboration with AGILE. In particular, they mention how UPFROnt, a policy framework developed within FORSEC, that is also used by AGILE, uses the
AGILE Identity Management Framework
.
Moreover, as
UPFROnt
is included as part of SEDARI, a framework to store and apply policies to data in the Cloud, the collaboration with AGILE turns SEDARI into an Oauth2 server and OAuth2 provider. They also mentioned that these capabilities are considered essential for IoT applications.
Thank you FORSEC for acknowledging our collaboration. We are pleased that both projects could help each other to achieve their goals!

Introduction

Development
measuring activity and steps, and c)
smartwatches
The architecture of the AGILE Software stack allows for the integration of new sensors increasing the usefulness of the Agile Gateway in many applications. In order to ease access to sensors data the Agile –IoT project has defined a set of REST commands which homogenize access to sensors. Unfortunately, due to the great variance of features and access protocols between devices, great effort is needed to integrate them via the implementation of corresponding device drivers but the architecture of the AGILE software stack aims to ease these difficulties. AGILE offers two methods of device integration:
Protocol-based implementation
:
Device based implementation
:
Implementation of device communication using existing AGILE PAN networking protocols. Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee are currently supported.
Sensor values from BLE devices can have various formats depending on the underlying parameter that is being measured. The values sent to the gateways can be sent as:
Single Measurements
:
The information of the measured parameter is fully described in a single transaction. Devices that send data in this way include blood pressure monitors and glucometers.
Multiple Measurements
:
Information is dependent upon a sequence of measured values in a specific timeframe ranging from seconds to hours. Devices which fall in this category include oximeters and ECGs.
Continuous Monitoring
:
In this case, data is sent to the gateway in real-time or stored continuously on the device until connectivity to the gateway is possible. Wearables (activity trackers and smartwatches) as well as sensors that monitor continuously various biosignals belong to this category.
The Quantified Self Application
The Quantified Self application uses the AGILE software stack to access data from the supported sensors. The application allows the user to monitor his activity against predefined goals. Sensor-based and cloud-sourced data can be used to quantify the progress.

ERICA Project: When AGILE is talking to your kids
Posted on
4th September 2018
4th September 2018
ERICA project
was about evolving one of products,
NEXT
, an educational robot for toddlers, into a smart cloud connected robot, with the ability to interact with children. So here the challenge was to develop the software for connecting the embedded board in the robot to the
AI cloud platform FIONA
.
We were glad of finding the Agile Open Call. It was a perfect timing for us since we were planning to work on an evolution of our current suite of robots for toddlers with a more intelligent one. It was a perfect match, since we already had a product in the market with some units (about 5,000) upgradeable to be connected to the cloud. By using AGILE stack, we obtained a framework to have things done. The initial learning curve was a bit tough but we quickly take over thanks to the support of the AGILE tech team. We met some challenges regarding the hardware requirements, as to run the Java version of AGILE, since our hardware setup, although powerful, it was tightened by low-price requirements to meet market constrains. The AGILE consortium understood perfectly the situation and both parties agreed to reshape the initial scope of our proposal. We developed a lightweight C++ implementation of AGILE core components, following the same architectural pattern as in the Java version. With this contribution the AGILE project is now able to support more hardware devices as i.e. Raspberry Pi Zero.
The possibility of including dissemination actions to the budget was a strong plus. This allowed us to participate in relevant trade shows to gain feedback from real customers, as well as to produce a video to introduce the consumers the new product and its advantages.

Beyond the money, having the support and advise of external experts is always good to reconsider your approach. AGILE has provided us a strong push to the development of our new product which we expect to take to the market in the coming months.
Nevertheless, taking advantage of the communication channels of the AGILE project and consortium helps us, as a SME to get known beyond our own audience, enabling us to reach to new people, and hopefully open new opportunities.

The main objective of the experiment considers the integration of
Senseioty
, the FlairBit
software
platform
to accelerate the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT)
Big Data Analytics
, with the
Agile IoT gateway
and services. This integration allows Senseioty to benefit in flexibility both in terms of
data ingestion and edge computing capabilities.
From a technical standpoint, joining the Agile-IoT ecosystem allowed FlairBit to benefit from the
many innovative services provided by the Agile-IoT platform that are also available in Senseioty
after the integration carried out in the proposed project. The Agile IoT gateway modularity and
compliance with many architectures at the hardware level provide support for various wireless
and wired IoT networking technologies. Senseioty benefits from these additional protocols as a
way to create new data sources and IoT connectors which in turn creates data diversity and
heterogeneity. These features allow to speed-up the development of the integrated solution and to
reduce the time-to-market for the applications built on-top-of Senseioty. We have also
benchmarked other gateways, but they usually lack the rapid and smooth integration of software components with third party systems.
In fact, at the software level, the Agile IoT stack provides data collection and management
capabilities on the gateway, an intuitive interface for device management, a visual workflow editor

inCare Together is taking care of our seniors
Posted on
31st August 2018
31st August 2018
EUROB CREATIVE
(www.eurob.com)
is a highly innovative SME focused on empowering individuals through mobile and IoT technologies. It is focused on the sectors of
m-Health
,
m-Commerce
and
3D technologies
, developing and commercializing relevant products, especially
inCare Together
, which was selected as one of the top projects by Agile-IoT in their First Open call for projects.
In an ageing Europe, developed economies are looking for scalable and cost-efficient ways to improve the quality of life and independence of seniors. In this general context, inCare Together targets the large and growing market of
seniors’ homecare
, both for individual homes and for large nursing home facilities. It utilizes EUROB’s InCity Together Platform as a backbone, together with AGILE-IoT gateways and modern and appealing wearables as input sensors. inCare Together addresses several acute growing needs of both caregivers and seniors at homecare, particularly with regards to non-intrusive, yet efficient, health and safety monitoring.
inCare Together has been developed with three objectives in mind:
to help seniors maintain their independence and keep living at home for longer time, while at the same time providing them with a feeling of being cared and having immediate help when needed.
to allow family members to monitor the safety and wellbeing of their elderly relatives remotely without disrupting their daily life.
to assist caregivers of nursing homes and facilities in the monitoring of elderly people, enabling them to check the status of residents and identify possible problems or emergencies as fast as possible.
The solution consists of a smart wristband, additional smart sensors and an AGILE-IoT based node that provides real-time data about the geolocation, heart rate and regular activity of the elderly person. These data is stored in a cloud-based system for historical processing and emergency detection. Using AGILE and InCity Together technologies, the solution offers end-to-end privacy and security control.
for creating integration patterns with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for releasing the
resulting end-to-end applications. Senseioty generates data analytics applications and workflows
to be pushed as close as possible to the data sources and the devices, hence Agile IoT gateway represents
the perfect match to deploy secure, scalable and reliable Senseioty edge-computing applications.
The overall system resulting from the integration of the Agile IoT stack and Senseioty allows
application developers to rapidly create and deploy innovative IoT applications without the necessity to customize a given IoT platform which in turn,, saves development time and resources.
Moreover, FlairBit, as an IoT platform provider, can now benefit from the Agile IoT ecosystem as a
way to boost its user and developer base and create new revenue streams, since Senseioty can
now be exploited and used in innovative cross-domain applications.
Furthermore, , in accessing the Agile-IoT ecosystem, FlairBit benefits from the different competencies,
technologies, and use cases of the partners in the consortium. From a business perspective, it
allows the generation of partnership to speed-up the go-to-market strategy in new markets for FlairBit.
In fact, Agile-IoT provides an interoperability framework to enable IoT platforms to open up access
to their devices/services in a controlled and secure manner. This pursues the acquisition of new revenue
streams for offering added value services along with receiving missing ingredients that enrich
FlairBit business offerings.
To conclude, the open source software Agile-IoT consortium is developing with a business-friendly license that allows FlairBit’s Senseioty IoT platforms to be Agile-IoT compliant, and at the same time to remain proprietary which allows FlairBit to increase its own product value and unlocking potential businesses in new markets. Simultaneously, FlairBit open sourced software components extend the Agile IoT stack and enables Big-Data Analytics on-top-of Agile IoT gateway, based on open source technologies (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Beam).

The analysis of collected IoT data allows for early detection of critical situations and health risk factors, wandering beyond facilities, emergency alarms, deviations in physical activity patterns analysis and others. Based on this, inCare Together creates automatic reports for authorized caregivers (family members, nurses, doctors) that can be accessed via web or delivered to their email accounts.
inCare Together is going to be marketed as a monthly/yearly subscription service. Benefits unlocked: Seniors are more well protected and feel more independent while their caregivers gain piece of mind about the seniors’ whereabouts and physical wellbeing, freeing up time and resources for other duties, instantly and accurately being notified about critical events. Also, nursing organizations reduce effort and costs associated to seniors’ everyday monitoring, thus contributing to health system sustainability.
inCare Together has been possible to be realized thanks to the support provided by Agile-IoT, both in the platform side, which has became the cornerstone of inCare and in the visibility provided and support by the project, that has helped us to overcome the technical difficulties found.

You always hear: “Data here. Data there.”
It’s funny that almost no one talks about Information, yet everyone is connecting more and more devices to the internet and storing their data.
And if they are not extracting information from that data, why bother storing it in the first place?
Seconds can be the differentiator between fixed and broken, faulty -working, accident-good fortune , life or death.
Fog computing becomes the standard due to firstly having the need of information in real-time but simultaneously , the need of data to be correlated, something that is impossible, if our processing is centered in either our devices or our datacenter.
The Agile Gateway was incredible in assisting us to understand how we could bring this decentralized value to our business and platform which enabled us to offer a better service with better performance and responsiveness.

Aquatic Project with Bioceanor
Posted on
25th August 2018
25th August 2018
Bioceanor
(
www.bioceanor.com
), a French start-up, was one of the 8 winners of the first Agile IoT Open Call. Bioceanor presented their results after 6 months of project. They deployed 3 devices for real-time water monitoring in the context of Aquaculture. One is in a fish farm (figure 1), another is in a shellfish farm (figure 2), and the third one is in a microalgae production farm (figure 3). The devices are taking one measure every 20 minutes of water temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and salinity.
Figure 1
Figure 2
Figure 3
They used Agile IoT architecture and gateway (figure 4) to collect data from the devices and to send them to their visualisation platform.
Figure 4
The feed-back of the end users was really positive, as the real-time water monitoring was really useful to their production follow-up. They could anticipate some events and correlate the water monitoring data to their production data. Agile IoT framework helped Bioceanor to deploy faster and easier the overall architecture, giving a robust product to the end user.
Thanks to the visibility of the Agile IoT project and the proof of concept, Bioceanor has now several devices orders from aquaculture customers in production.

The overall objective of the extension project
VizLore Labs Foundation
(VLF) participated in the AGILE IoT second open call extension with the project titled “
Federated IoT blockchain fabric
”.
The main objective of this extension project was to work on integrating
VizLore IoT platform with the AGILE IoT platform
through joint blockchain fabric based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric framework. The result is the first federated IoT blockchain established between two IoT platforms covering various IoT verticals. This integration enhances the AGILE IoT platform with robust blockchain enabled security and privacy policy enforcement framework while simultaneously broadening and enhancing the potential of the VizLore federated IoT blockchain solution.
Motivation behind the extension project
What the research community and industry are agreeing on is that IoT systems currently lack blockchain building frameworks which consider specific requirements of a typical IoT system including: a large number of microtransactions, unfeasible proof of work validation, real-time validation, avoiding large transaction fees, IoT specific smart contracts, high node churn in case of hosting ledger on end-user personal devices. To address these challenges, VizLore built the IoT blockchain framework (based on Hyperledger Fabric) which enables federation of blockchains across multiple IoT systems and platforms. In order to properly validate the federation potential, we required collaboration with an IoT platform provider who offers open software stack that is capable of hosting our software agents and focusing on the edge and fog components of IoT systems. The AGILE IoT fulfilled both requirements. IoT gateway software architecture is very similar to that of our IoT controllers and cloud platform. AGILE IoT focuses on building new IoT systems with specific configuration and deployment of IoT gateways. This proved to be an ideal blockchain federation enabler since each new gateway instance (on both AGILE and VizLore Labs end) introduces a new node into the federated blockchain architecture and enhances its distribution span and robustness. The AGILE IoT project pilots require innovative privacy management approaches which do not limit the business potential based on data sharing. The VizLore extension project also focused on producing a set of smart contract templates, specifically tailored for IoT business cases that are automatically stored on the federated blockchain. Therefore, the integration potential was very high and this remained true during the execution of the extension project.
Experience during the implementation of the extension project
During execution of the extension project and porting of the VizLore federated blockchain enablers onto the AGILE SW stack, we have worked most of the AGILE SW components and services (GW SE stack, ramp-up configurator, Node-RED, recommender system). The documentation and examples are excellent and allowed fast validation and prototyping. Together with the AGILE team, we have identified the need for supporting 64-bit OS architectures on AGILE GWs in order to enable full integration of the Hyperledger Fabric components. Integration with the ramp-up configurator and Node-RED environment helped us to validate the role of our Hyperledger Fabric components in fast IoT system prototyping framework. We have identified and addressed all the requirements that our solution needs to fulfill in order to be an integral part of the AGILE fast IoT prototyping framework, thus bringing the blockchain technology closer to the IoT system integrators.
Achieved results and impact
We promote our solution as blockchain as a service (BaaS). Consequently, , “collective IoT” security and privacy management as a service is offered to IoT platform operators and system integrators. The VizLore IoT blockchain fabric can be deployed on IoT platforms (as part of VizLore IoT edge devices or hosted on 3rd party edge devices and servers) regardless whether or not their services actively use the blockchain applications. The VizLore federated Hyperledger fabric for IoT systems is actively being exploited as an integral part of the VizLore’s business strategy and IoT service offerings. Our Smart Access Control IoT service is enhanced with the Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts so that each virtual key is a smart contract stored on the federated blockchain fabric. This significantly enhances security and robustness, while providing solid ground for establishing innovative business models for entrance vouchers and remote access control.
Our Hyperledger agents, blockchain network generator, Node-RED component, and smart contract templates are available as part of the AGILE IoT software stack.

HAWK project: monitoring elder people living alone
Posted on
4th December 2018
8th December 2018
The
HAWK
project is about monitoring the
elderly living alone
through off-the-shelve movement sensors, through the development of a model of the elder’s home activity through artificial intelligence technologies. The activity being continuously acquired by the movements of the elder through their home (in his/her daily activities) is compared against the last trained model to provide insights about routines and deviations from “what has been learned”, in order to alert caregivers or professional service providers on warnings or alarms derived from those deviations.
The architecture of the system is the combination of AGILE gateway and
S&C’s enControl IoT platform
and smart home solution. At the AGILE gateway, we have developed a protocol for a commercial movement detector device (PIR), that one may capture movement events detected to fit the activity model. The protocol has been encapsulated within a dedicated docker container, allowing any other AGILE component to work with the PIR sensor. The protocol pushes PIR events to enControl IoT platform,where the activity model has been developed and deployed. Results from the model evaluation against PIR events are broadcasted using messages in a pub/sub architecture within enControl. This pub/sub connectivity is used to connect this output back to AGILE (GW) by a developed microservice, so it can be exploited by other AGILE components. The microservice is also a docker container, and it opens a persistent connection to enControl by using lightweight web sockets technology allowing real-time server push updates.
enControl is constantly monitoring devices data received from the gateway and, for example, when an anomaly is detected, it’s pushed immediately to the HAWK notifier microservice who then proceeds to parse the data and store it in a local database.

Trusted Data Sharing with Linked Data in the Internet of Things (IoT)
Posted on
15th June 2017
25th August 2018
5th December 2018
The domain of vacation rentals has drastically evolved over the last few years, thanks to popular online platforms like
AirBnB
and
HomeAway
. Unlike hotels, which are usually equipped with complex automation technologies, vacation rental properties are still running behind and have not yet adopted
connected home technologies
. The reason is usually the lack of dedicated IoT solutions which do not require complex house renovations and high initial investments. The lack of connected home technologies turns out to be a missed opportunity for the owner or manager to save energy, money, and time and to simplify the management of the property.
Modosmart
(
www.modosmart.com
) wants to solve this problem and has developed
ELIO
, an IoT solution which reduces the energy expenses in vacation rental properties thanks to the automation of air-conditioning and heating based on presence detection technology. The system includes two devices developed by Modosmart, namely a window sensor and a room sensor unit which includes presence detection and temperature and humidity sensing. The devices are in pre-commercial state, tested and validated with a set of early adopters. They use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication. In addition, the solution is equipped with an off-the-shelf air-conditioning controller able to control any type of infrared based A/C split machine.
Modosmart was selected as one of the eight startups awarded in the first open call launched by the Agile-IoT project and which had proposed project ideas to integrate the Agile-IoT gateway into existing IoT solutions. Our project aimed to integrate the Agile-IoT gateway hardware and software stack into the Elio solution.
The project started on the 1st of January and ended on the 30th of June. During the first half of the project there has been a thorough analysis of the gateway stack with the aim to allow the gateway to speak with the custom devices developed by Modosmart. The outcome of this phase was a proof of concept demo showing the gateway communicating with an ESP32 board, equipped with BLE communication and using the same Nordic nrf51822 microcontroller used in our custom BLE devices.
During the second three months of the project, the proof of concept board has been replaced by the real devices of the Elio solution. At the end of this phase the gateway was able to collect presence, temperature and humidity data from the room sensor unit, to monitor weather a window is open or close and to control the air-conditioning by speaking to the off-the-shelf controller.
Thanks to the collaboration with the Agile-IoT project and to the received funding, the Elio solution is now able to rely on a modular, robust and flexible gateway which can accelerate the time-to-market. The modularity, robustness and flexibility is a result of the fact that the Agile-IoT gateway is built on top of a Docker containerized system powered by ResinOS, which is an operating system bringing the containerization approach to embedded systems. The benefits of using a modular containerized framework is demonstrated by the fact that by developing our own container we have been able to connect the Agile-IoT gateway to our devices without any modification to the other parts of the system.
Developing on top of a Docker based system has been the first experience at Modosmart, and thanks to the possibility offered by the Agile-IoT project and to the support received by the project’s technical team, we have been able to achieve our objective in a relatively short time and without facing major obstacles.

An Overview of Research on Computational Resource Management in AGILE
Posted on
7th November 2018
21st November 2018
This post intends to give the reader a perspective on how Jolocom brings trusted data sharing to the AGILE IoT Gateway (
AGILE
is a H2020 project). It should provide essential value to the user, not only but also in context of the internet of things, and not least to benefits from the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (
GDPR
).
The original idea of the World Wide Web
To start with, the vision of Jolocom aligns with the original idea of the World Wide Web, which was distributed: everyone would have their own node (e.g. home page), everyone would share their content (e.g. blog posts), and everyone would own their own data. The web consisted of nodes connected through links with no center. Jolocom wants to help reclaiming this vision that everyone owns their own node (digital identity) and that every node can communicate with any other node, with no intermediation (e.g. centralized platform).
The dominating power of a few
Today a handful of companies dominate vast parts of the web’s activities – Facebook for social networking, Google for searching, Paypal for payments or eBay for auctions, Samsung/IBM for IoT – and they actually own the data their users have provided and generated. Ergo these companies have unprecedented insight and power over us. They can influence and nudge us without our knowledge, which gives them not only a huge competitive advantage, but also interferes with fundamental values of society and the right for privacy.
Social Linked Data (Solid) and Blockchain (Ethereum)
Jolocom uses a decentralized software architecture that is very promising. It was initiated by
Tim Berners-Lee
who invented the web and gave it to us as a gift, free and open source. His new project is called
Solid
(“social linked data”) and it allows you to own your own data, while also using it with only the applications you want to use. With Solid, you simply store your data in your own Personal Data Store (
PDS
; in Jolocom’s case: a Solid Server), which is hosted wherever you wish. At the core of Solid is the WebID, which Jolocom integrates with the
Ethereum
blockchain, to build a self-sovereign digital identity that allows you to represent yourself and to enrich your data with semantic meaning. Besides that and storing data, it also lets other applications ask for your data. Solid authenticates the
DApps
(Decentralized Applications) through Access Control Lists (ACLs) and if you’ve given access permission to the requester of the data, the Solid server delivers it.
Here’s a concrete example.You might store data from your IoT devices or sensors in your own PDS: the sort of data about yourself that would normally be uploaded directly from your IoT device to a third party. That way if someone built a new DApp, to offer specialized services to people, you could join it by using your WebID. To share information with others (individuals or organisations), you simply give them permission to access the appropriate information in your PDS. The data in your PDS would remain your own, in every sense of the word: fully under your control, stored where you choose, and usable only by an Organization’s WebID that you’ve given permission to.

food supply chains
. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.

monitoring platform allows the supply chain stakeholders of bottled wine to monitor the most critical parameters affecting wine quality during its storage and transportation. Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.
In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).
The results of the ISTMOS-AGILE integration have been evaluated through a pilot case study in collaboration with two large Greek wineries.
Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.

We would like to take this opportunity to illustrate the challenges related to computational resource consumption such as memory, CPU or networking, in our gateway setup. First and foremost, we must admit the utmost importance of ensuring that services provided by the gateway have reasonable use of the computational resources. This is how we can ensure that there is space available for applications using core services from AGILE. However, this is not the only reason to keep an eye on resource consumption. There are also security implications and economic reasons to monitor and control the use of resources, i.e. especially when computation should be offloaded to the cloud.
We will discuss the release of an open-source component to measure resource consumption in the gateway plus other scenarios. We will then explain how we have used this component in the scope of the project to perform several research tasks. Applications of the resource measurement component have been used to study resource abuse scenarios from the perspective of security, detection of crypto-miners, and evaluation of strategies to balance the computation load between the gateway and the cloud.

The fantastic thing about Solid is that it does all this without having to centralize information in hands that we can’t- and too often also should not – fully trust.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Users are becoming increasingly aware of the need and importance for strong data rights. Governments are slowly adapting to this, with the upcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation as the first move towards a market in which businesses will have to adapt with new business models and technical infrastructure. With the decentralized web as an answer to these needs, users will be able to use services they want to interact with, data will be stored in their own private location, and they will be able to switch between them. This will allow and encourage for a market with a significantly lowered barrier to innovate, one in which collaboration between players is much favourable over competition. Without the main competitive advantage of data, network effects and vendor lock-in will become virtually obsolete. We help businesses create and participate in collaborative decentralized ecosystems where the value generated by its services benefits the ecosystem as a whole.
GDPR compliance is now mandated by May 2018. This means businesses are now required to show exactly how the data they collect is used and enables them to freely take this data with them to different services.
Conclusion
Social Linked Data with its decentralized architecture has the properties to profoundly enrich trust, data portability, and privacy. At the same time it will step up usability to a whole new level for both the user and service providers, while simultaneously becoming compliant to GDPR.

Adaptation Exhibition
Posted on
6th June 2017
21st July 2017
You are invited to attend the Adaptation exhibition on July
11-13 in Berlin, Germany.
The event will kick off at 6 pm on July 11 and will be open the two following days. The venue is
Agora Rollberg
, a Berlin-based experimental center for contemporary practices. The perfect place for this exposition!
You will get to see the four projects that have been working on their art + IoT piece since March. They have been collaborating with some AGILE partners: BioAssist, ATOS, Libelium, and Create-Net who have helped the artists with the AGILE software.
Being a software company, one of the key challenges we face on a regular basis is on how to design and develop custom hardware components in order to either explore new services or accommodate specific customer needs. This typically involves specific hardware and IoT devices to be integrated. With the IoT ecosystem comprising many hundreds of new players offering one or two parts of the IoT puzzle, finding the right hardware + software solution is often a time-consuming task, especially for small companies like Thinkinside.
The Agile project allowed us to tackle one of the key pain points of ICT companies working in the IoT+retail sector, and in particular
Interoperability
and
integration
of IoT hardware platform and components: by relying on the Agile gateway and the readily available hardware and software components, integration and interoperability can be simplified a lot, especially during the initial design and fast prototyping phase of the solution.
Fast implementation
and
prototyping
: the Agile hardware and software modules allowed us to develop solutions and prototypes in a very small time. This is considered as key when developing Proof of concepts for customers or when developing new solutions.
Support for many different standard hardware solutions
covering different options in terms of connectivity, sensing boards, costs, form factors, etc.: the Agile software can run on many different hardware platforms. This allows us to easily scale the solution to the most appropriate hardware platform required to address customer needs.
Allowing companies to
focus on value added services
(rather than hw design and maintenance): our focus is software and the creation of innovative retail services and solutions. By mitigating the risk involved in the design and implementation of hardware component, we can focus on our key expertise (software) and create, in a faster way, new services to ne introduced in the market.

HOLONIX – AgriAware: produce food and consciously buy it on the market
Posted on
15th October 2018
15th October 2018
Thanks to AGILE IoT Community,
Holonix
has been able to develop an effective tool for the
Agricultural
sector. The core objective has been the possibility to offer a tool to produce and purchase food on the market. Farmers are guided, from fields and environments, to follow precise procedures for the production of high quality products, tracing maturity stages. The Farmer Assistant App suggests appropriate treatments and operations that provide the growing of trees and fruits, accurate time to proceed with fruit harvesting and send climate condition notifications. With the enablement to produce more with less, farmers are becoming economically competitive by applying environmentally sustainable techniques.
Through Agile, Holonix has demonstrated how it is achievable to integrate different types of weather stations and new sensors to facilitate and acquire a wider variety of environmental data that influence the fruit treatment.
Our needs, vision, and mission are explained below:
NEEDS
A wider growing percentage of olive oil consumers is becoming extremely cautious and accurate in the selection of the products to consume as well as to high demand in terms of quality. Consumers, buying a food product, want to be assured that the products on their tables are with certified origins, produced accordingly to biological processes, and have a high regard for farmer labor conditions.

VISION
The
AgriAware
solution, through specific apps (one for the farmer and one for the consumer), was born with the desire to offer an effective tool for the production of food and the determination to purchase on the market. AgriAware uses the information collected from the fields and environment to guide farmers in following the exact procedures to produce high-quality products and tracking the maturity stages.
The
FarmerAssistant
app, advises based on the environmental data collected from the fields (such as temperature and humidity), the appropriate treatments and operations for trees and fruits. In addition, the application proposes the accurate time to proceed with fruit harvesting to ensure the correct stage of maturity and it sends notifications for climate conditions such as when the humidity of the air and soil are the optimal ones for harvesting. Furthermore, this app will also consider the fruit variety.
The
TrustLabel
app offers to consumers the opportunity to be informed about the properties of food and the quality of the production process.
MISSION
Bring to consumers’ tables a high-quality product with all nutritive properties. AgriAware enables farmers to become economically competitive by producing more with less using environmentally sustainable techniques. They are guided by information that is extracted from the combination of a variety of data coming from IoT sensors. These sensors are installed within the environment with weather forecasts and an analysis of treatment historical data done in the past seasons.
Thanks to Agile IoT Community, Holonix took part in AgriResearch in Brussels, on the 2nd and 3rd of May 2018 and in ICE Conference in Stuttgart on 20th of June 2018. These events gave the opportunity to meet new agricultural stakeholders, to receive news about the sector, suggestions, and feedbacks on AgriAware solution and how to improve it

Integrate Agile IoT gateways to Watson IoT platform
Posted on
12th December 2018
12th December 2018
Sensinov
is a start-up specializing in smart building and industrial IoT setups offering an interoperability as a service which aims at coping with huge device diversity, lifecycle management, and continuous operations of IoT solutions.
The diversity of devices and connectivity networks in smart building can only grow with new and emerging devices that are entering the mainstream. To ensure future proof and sustainable deployment of smart buildings, there is a need to:
Transform the collected data into uniform data formats
ensuring their proper handling by applications and IoT platforms. By doing so, the management of the life cycle (changing device vendor or changing IoT platform provider) becomes an easy task for IoT project owners.
Process the data locally
and send only processed/filtered data to the cloud. Indeed, huge amounts of data sets could be generated. It is neither beneficial nor economically viable to send all the data to the cloud. Processing data locally is an emerging technical and business imperative. It is usually performed through running application logic closer to the IoT devices: i.e. where the data is generated.
Sensinov was selected for an open call of H2020 Agile IoT project. Our role in the project was to integrate Agile IoT gateways in the
Watson IoT platform
. This was an excellent opportunity for Sensinov to demonstrate its interoperability platform in action. Among our findings:
Agile IoT provides us a perfect development environment to cope with industrial IoT requirements from real life projects.
These requirements include
:
The management of diversity in IoT devices and protocols
The enhancement of efficiency through local processing

Device connectivity
Protocol adaptation
Data processing close to the devices
Securing IoT communications
Ensuring system extensibility through the installation of new applications
As a smart building specialist without any plan to build hardware, Agile IoT provides a perfect solution for deployment scenarios where the need to add a gateway is necessary with the absence of local and extensible local processing capabilities. Sensinov is currently considering the inclusion of an Agile IoT compatible gateway in its portfolio, partnering with a hardware player who adheres to the Agile IoT principles. In interest to our roadmap and strategy, Agile IoT offers us several interesting value propositions including:
A rich set of connectors (Enocean, ZWave, ZigBee, BLE, etc)
An open source approach which avoids lock-in for Sensinov as a provider and for our customers
The development of an ecosystem of providers
Modular hardware and software to adapt to different deployment needs

Agile for the retail analytics industry: Thinkinside experience
Posted on
16th August 2018
16th August 2018
Thinkinside
is a company specialised in retail analytics. It’s flagship product
RetailerIN
(
www.retailerin.com
) allows to analyse customers behaviour in retail stores and to suggest possible interventions on how to optimise store operations and organisation. The product exploits IoT devices in store in order to collect anonymous information on customer’s behaviour. Examples of such IoT devices are Bluetooth Low Energy TAGs placed on products, or people counters at the entrance. Such devices are typically connected through an in-store gateway to the cloud where data is processed and analysed at scale.
Being a software company, one of the key challenges we face on a regular basis is on how to design and develop custom hardware components in order to either explore new services or accommodate specific customer needs. This typically involves specific hardware and IoT devices to be integrated. With the IoT ecosystem comprising many hundreds of new players offering one or two parts of the IoT puzzle, finding the right hardware + software solution is often a time-consuming task, especially for small companies like Thinkinside.

Dual-use in technology means that it can be used for both peaceful and military purposes. In this context, Sky-Watch has been invited by the European Commission to explain how H2020 funded project helps his business strategy.
“
AGILE
provided
Sky-Watch
with the opportunity – and funding – to trial this new technology, without the need to search for commercial investors who tend to be risk-averse. Being part of a consortium also put Sky-Watch in contact with major companies, providing credibility, knowledge, and opportunities for further collaborative efforts.
Participation in
Horizon 2020
gave us access to new technology and meant that we could provide consortium partners with something they did not have. ”

Interoperability
and
integration
of IoT hardware platform and components: by relying on the Agile gateway and the readily available hardware and software components, integration and interoperability can be simplified a lot, especially during the initial design and fast prototyping phase of the solution.
Fast implementation
and
prototyping
: the Agile hardware and software modules allowed us to develop solutions and prototypes in a very small time. This is considered as key when developing Proof of concepts for customers or when developing new solutions.
Support for many different standard hardware solutions
covering different options in terms of connectivity, sensing boards, costs, form factors, etc.: the Agile software can run on many different hardware platforms. This allows us to easily scale the solution to the most appropriate hardware platform required to address customer needs.
Allowing companies to
focus on value added services
(rather than hw design and maintenance): our focus is software and the creation of innovative retail services and solutions. By mitigating the risk involved in the design and implementation of hardware component, we can focus on our key expertise (software) and create, in a faster way, new services to ne introduced in the market.

The main objective of the experiment considers the integration of
Senseioty
, the FlairBit
software
platform
to accelerate the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT)
Big Data Analytics
, with the
Agile IoT gateway
and services. This integration allows Senseioty to benefit in flexibility both in terms of
data ingestion and edge computing capabilities.
From a technical standpoint, joining the Agile-IoT ecosystem allowed FlairBit to benefit from the
many innovative services provided by the Agile-IoT platform that are also available in Senseioty
after the integration carried out in the proposed project. The Agile IoT gateway modularity and
compliance with many architectures at the hardware level provide support for various wireless
and wired IoT networking technologies. Senseioty benefits from these additional protocols as a
way to create new data sources and IoT connectors which in turn creates data diversity and
heterogeneity. These features allow to speed-up the development of the integrated solution and to
reduce the time-to-market for the applications built on-top-of Senseioty. We have also
benchmarked other gateways, but they usually lack the rapid and smooth integration of software components with third party systems.
In fact, at the software level, the Agile IoT stack provides data collection and management

capabilities on the gateway, an intuitive interface for device management, a visual workflow editor
for creating integration patterns with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for releasing the
resulting end-to-end applications. Senseioty generates data analytics applications and workflows
to be pushed as close as possible to the data sources and the devices, hence Agile IoT gateway represents
the perfect match to deploy secure, scalable and reliable Senseioty edge-computing applications.
The overall system resulting from the integration of the Agile IoT stack and Senseioty allows
application developers to rapidly create and deploy innovative IoT applications without the necessity to customize a given IoT platform which in turn,, saves development time and resources.
Moreover, FlairBit, as an IoT platform provider, can now benefit from the Agile IoT ecosystem as a
way to boost its user and developer base and create new revenue streams, since Senseioty can
now be exploited and used in innovative cross-domain applications.
Furthermore, , in accessing the Agile-IoT ecosystem, FlairBit benefits from the different competencies,
technologies, and use cases of the partners in the consortium. From a business perspective, it
allows the generation of partnership to speed-up the go-to-market strategy in new markets for FlairBit.
In fact, Agile-IoT provides an interoperability framework to enable IoT platforms to open up access
to their devices/services in a controlled and secure manner. This pursues the acquisition of new revenue
streams for offering added value services along with receiving missing ingredients that enrich
FlairBit business offerings.
To conclude, the open source software Agile-IoT consortium is developing with a business-friendly license that allows FlairBit’s Senseioty IoT platforms to be Agile-IoT compliant, and at the same time to remain proprietary which allows FlairBit to increase its own product value and unlocking potential businesses in new markets. Simultaneously, FlairBit open sourced software components extend the Agile IoT stack and enables Big-Data Analytics on-top-of Agile IoT gateway, based on open source technologies (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Beam).

Monitoring the Supply Chain of Bottled Wine with AGILE
Posted on
8th December 2018
8th December 2018
Maintaining appropriate conditions in the storage and transport of sensitive products is an age-old problem for
food supply chains
. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.

AGILE Pilot: Enhanced Retail Services
Posted on
3rd June 2016
25th April 2017
In a world where we have instant access to information and where competition is just a click away, it has become crucial to attract customers and to keep them interested. If we put this scenario in the context of an economic crisis and where small retailers are directly competing with large shopping centers or hypermarkets, we can plainly see that it becomes increasingly difficult for the retailers. In this situation, information technology, IoT in particular, can help the sector improve and show what is has to offer. The key is to make the product or service more attractive to customers and differentiate it from the competitors. One approach it so highlight the quality and the possibilities for personalization, which are advantages smaller retailers have that run-of-the-mill superstores typically don’t.
Specifically,
Agile Gateway
can help retailers achieve this goal by orchestrating a network of IoT devices and sensors and by delivering content and personalized promotion directly to customers. This creates new opportunities for retailers and allows them to by study their clientele by tracking and analyzing their behavior.
All in all, the goal is to enhance the customers experience and in turn increase their satisfaction and loyalty. Eventually, retailers will be provided with innovative tools and channels that help them better understand their target customer and their behavior to meet their needs and expectations.

ISTMOS
monitoring platform allows the supply chain stakeholders of bottled wine to monitor the most critical parameters affecting wine quality during its storage and transportation. Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.
In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).
The results of the ISTMOS-AGILE integration have been evaluated through a pilot case study in collaboration with two large Greek wineries.
Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.

Demo Day at TU Graz, Austria
Posted on
24th April 2017
27th April 2017
The AGILE consortium had its quarterly plenary meeting at the end of March in Graz, Austria. FBK / Create-Net, AGILE project leader, took advantage of this opportunity to ask each of the partners to create a demonstration focusing on one aspect of the project for which they were responsible or involved. This resulted in an excellent demo session where we were able to take the pulse of the project.
This post lists and describes most of these demonstrations in order to share with you this excellent feedback.

AirEx – Smart ventilation control to balance energy efficiency with air-exchange
Posted on
28th January 2019
28th January 2019
AirEx
is a novel
smart home technology
that helps reducing the home’s heat demand, without compromising moisture build-up and subsequently damp and indoor air quality. AirEx uses smart sensors to monitor and analyse environmental conditions while its cloud-based algorithms determine the vent state to automatically regulate airflow. It uses AI to predict occupants’ behaviour and weather patterns for more efficient airflow optimisation. Via improved thermal efficiency of the building fabric,
the system can reduce heating energy bills by 15%
, which means 2-3 years payback. AirEx’s key customers are
Social Housing Associations
who have the mandate to improve the energy efficiency of their building stock.
Within the scope of Agile IoT project, we had the opportunity to develop standard APIs using Agile IoT to interact to our product, AirEx and make it therefore
more agnostic
with regards to integration with third party connected devices and infrastructure. During this project the key component we utilised is ‘Connectivity and Communication Protocols’, where we managed to extend this component via implementing agile-rfm69 protocol to communicate using
HopeRF RFM69 module
.
We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.
Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.

Goodbye AGILE… Welcome AGAIL!
Posted on
28th January 2019
1st March 2019
The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the
Eclipse AGAIL open source project
. Don’t hesitate to try it, adopt it and contribute back to it!

Project Coordinator of the AGILE project

The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.
In the future we are keen to continue to use Agile-BLE in order to integrate additional sensors. In addition, once the Agile hub becomes LoRaWAN-enabled we will be very keen to explore the possibility of using Agile hub.
Our Software Lead is presenting some of the key outcomes of the project via this IoT Webinar:

Recommender systems in the Internet of Things
Posted on
22nd June 2018
26th June 2018
Our partner, the
University of Graz,
publishes a very interesting article in
JAXenter magazine
about the added value of “Recommendation Systems” in the world of the Internet of Things.:
Recommender systems in the Internet of Things
.
SMAU 2018 Milan
(Halls 4 of FieramilanoCity).
The main objective of the experiment regards the integration of
Senseioty
, the
FlairBit software platform
to accelerate the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT)
Big Data Analytics
, with the
Agile IoT gateway
and services.
This integration allows
Senseioty
to benefit in flexibility both in terms of data ingestion and edge computing capabilities. Moreover, the Agile Gateway modularity at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired IoT networking technologies and Senseioty benefits from these additional protocols as a way to create new data sources and IoT connectors.
On the other hand, Senseioty offers a usable
Distributed Data Stream Processor
(DDSP), leveraging artificial intelligence to anticipate problems, detect unexpected event patterns and to optimize processes, services and decisions. This component has been integrated with the Agile IoT gateway enabling new innovative services at edge level and making such services available in the Agile IoT market place and ecosystem through Senseioty.

Taking someone else’s place is never easy, especially when you are the project manager of a big H2020 EU project like AGILE (www.agile-iot.eu). However, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the exceptional people that are part of a great consortium (the researchers, developers, biz guys, who I now call friends), I can say that WE did it very well! To be clear, I was already aware of that, but to read the conclusion of the official final review from the EU Commission which says “

Integrate Agile IoT gateways to Watson IoT platform

Sensinov
is a start-up specializing in smart building and industrial IoT setups offering an interoperability as a service which aims at coping with huge device diversity, lifecycle management, and continuous operations of IoT solutions.
The diversity of devices and connectivity networks in smart building can only grow with new and emerging devices that are entering the mainstream. To ensure future proof and sustainable deployment of smart buildings, there is a need to:
Transform the collected data into uniform data formats
ensuring their proper handling by applications and IoT platforms. By doing so, the management of the life cycle (changing device vendor or changing IoT platform provider) becomes an easy task for IoT project owners.
Process the data locally
and send only processed/filtered data to the cloud. Indeed, huge amounts of data sets could be generated. It is neither beneficial nor economically viable to send all the data to the cloud. Processing data locally is an emerging technical and business imperative. It is usually performed through running application logic closer to the IoT devices: i.e. where the data is generated.
Sensinov was selected for an open call of H2020 Agile IoT project. Our role in the project was to integrate Agile IoT gateways in the
Watson IoT platform
. This was an excellent opportunity for Sensinov to demonstrate its interoperability platform in action. Among our findings:
Agile IoT provides us a perfect development environment to cope with industrial IoT requirements from real life projects.
These requirements include
:

This
Virtual Eclipse IoT Meetup
invited the
AGILE
” is priceless!!!
So now you are probably wondering what’s next, right? As I mentioned earlier, it’s time to say goodbye to AGILE ☹
This amazing project has run its course, as it happens to all EU projects. But (now you know that) AGILE is not just another EU project. This is one more thing that makes it unique. AGILE is not dead! It has simply changed its name into ECLIPSE AGAIL. From now on, it will be fully Open Source and hosted by the Eclipse IoT Working group.
Long live ECLIPSE AGAIL!
Feel free to try it, adopt it and contribute back to it here:

Data processing close to the devices
Securing IoT communications
Ensuring system extensibility through the installation of new applications
As a smart building specialist without any plan to build hardware, Agile IoT provides a perfect solution for deployment scenarios where the need to add a gateway is necessary with the absence of local and extensible local processing capabilities. Sensinov is currently considering the inclusion of an Agile IoT compatible gateway in its portfolio, partnering with a hardware player who adheres to the Agile IoT principles. In interest to our roadmap and strategy, Agile IoT offers us several interesting value propositions including:
A rich set of connectors (Enocean, ZWave, ZigBee, BLE, etc)
An open source approach which avoids lock-in for Sensinov as a provider and for our customers
The development of an ecosystem of providers
Modular hardware and software to adapt to different deployment needs

Monitoring the Supply Chain of Bottled Wine with AGILE
Posted on
8th December 2018
8th December 2018
Maintaining appropriate conditions in the storage and transport of sensitive products is an age-old problem for
food supply chains
. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.
ISTMOS
monitoring platform allows the supply chain stakeholders of bottled wine to monitor the most critical parameters affecting wine quality during its storage and transportation. Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.
In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).

Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.

Heptasense: Navigating through the fog to build an understanding
Posted on
4th December 2018
8th December 2018
You always hear: “Data here. Data there.”
It’s funny that almost no one talks about Information, yet everyone is connecting more and more devices to the internet and storing their data.
And if they are not extracting information from that data, why bother storing it in the first place?
Seconds can be the differentiator between fixed and broken, faulty -working, accident-good fortune , life or death.
Fog computing becomes the standard due to firstly having the need of information in real-time but simultaneously , the need of data to be correlated, something that is impossible, if our processing is centered in either our devices or our datacenter.
The Agile Gateway was incredible in assisting us to understand how we could bring this decentralized value to our business and platform which enabled us to offer a better service with better performance and responsiveness.

The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the
Eclipse AGAIL open source project
. Don’t hesitate to try it, adopt it and contribute back to it!

VizLore: Federated IoT blockchain fabric
Posted on
4th December 2018
8th December 2018
The overall objective of the extension project
VizLore Labs Foundation
(VLF) participated in the AGILE IoT second open call extension with the project titled “
Federated IoT blockchain fabric
”.
The main objective of this extension project was to work on integrating
VizLore IoT platform with the AGILE IoT platform
through joint blockchain fabric based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric framework. The result is the first federated IoT blockchain established between two IoT platforms covering various IoT verticals. This integration enhances the AGILE IoT platform with robust blockchain enabled security and privacy policy enforcement framework while simultaneously broadening and enhancing the potential of the VizLore federated IoT blockchain solution.
Motivation behind the extension project
VizLore Labs Foundation
(VLF) participated in the AGILE IoT second open call extension with the project titled “
Federated IoT blockchain fabric
”.
The main objective of this extension project was to work on integrating
VizLore IoT platform with the AGILE IoT platform
through joint blockchain fabric based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric framework. The result is the first federated IoT blockchain established between two IoT platforms covering various IoT verticals. This integration enhances the AGILE IoT platform with robust blockchain enabled security and privacy policy enforcement framework while simultaneously broadening and enhancing the potential of the VizLore federated IoT blockchain solution.
Motivation behind the extension project
What the research community and industry are agreeing on is that IoT systems currently lack blockchain building frameworks which consider specific requirements of a typical IoT system including: a large number of microtransactions, unfeasible proof of work validation, real-time validation, avoiding large transaction fees, IoT specific smart contracts, high node churn in case of hosting ledger on end-user personal devices. To address these challenges, VizLore built the IoT blockchain framework (based on Hyperledger Fabric) which enables federation of blockchains across multiple IoT systems and platforms. In order to properly validate the federation potential, we required collaboration with an IoT platform provider who offers open software stack that is capable of hosting our software agents and focusing on the edge and fog components of IoT systems. The AGILE IoT fulfilled both requirements. IoT gateway software architecture is very similar to that of our IoT controllers and cloud platform. AGILE IoT focuses on building new IoT systems with specific configuration and deployment of IoT gateways. This proved to be an ideal blockchain federation enabler since each new gateway instance (on both AGILE and VizLore Labs end) introduces a new node into the federated blockchain architecture and enhances its distribution span and robustness. The AGILE IoT project pilots require innovative privacy management approaches which do not limit the business potential based on data sharing. The VizLore extension project also focused on producing a set of smart contract templates, specifically tailored for IoT business cases that are automatically stored on the federated blockchain. Therefore, the integration potential was very high and this remained true during the execution of the extension project.
Experience during the implementation of the extension project
During execution of the extension project and porting of the VizLore federated blockchain enablers onto the AGILE SW stack, we have worked most of the AGILE SW components and services (GW SE stack, ramp-up configurator, Node-RED, recommender system). The documentation and examples are excellent and allowed fast validation and prototyping. Together with the AGILE team, we have identified the need for supporting 64-bit OS architectures on AGILE GWs in order to enable full integration of the Hyperledger Fabric components. Integration with the ramp-up configurator and Node-RED environment helped us to validate the role of our Hyperledger Fabric components in fast IoT system prototyping framework. We have identified and addressed all the requirements that our solution needs to fulfill in order to be an integral part of the AGILE fast IoT prototyping framework, thus bringing the blockchain technology closer to the IoT system integrators.
Achieved results and impact
We promote our solution as blockchain as a service (BaaS). Consequently, , “collective IoT” security and privacy management as a service is offered to IoT platform operators and system integrators. The VizLore IoT blockchain fabric can be deployed on IoT platforms (as part of VizLore IoT edge devices or hosted on 3rd party edge devices and servers) regardless whether or not their services actively use the blockchain applications. The VizLore federated Hyperledger fabric for IoT systems is actively being exploited as an integral part of the VizLore’s business strategy and IoT service offerings. Our Smart Access Control IoT service is enhanced with the Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts so that each virtual key is a smart contract stored on the federated blockchain fabric. This significantly enhances security and robustness, while providing solid ground for establishing innovative business models for entrance vouchers and remote access control.
Our Hyperledger agents, blockchain network generator, Node-RED component, and smart contract templates are available as part of the AGILE IoT software stack.

Therefore, the integration potential was very high and this remained true during the execution of the extension project.
Experience during the implementation of the extension project
During execution of the extension project and porting of the VizLore federated blockchain enablers onto the AGILE SW stack, we have worked most of the AGILE SW components and services (GW SE stack, ramp-up configurator, Node-RED, recommender system). The documentation and examples are excellent and allowed fast validation and prototyping. Together with the AGILE team, we have identified the need for supporting 64-bit OS architectures on AGILE GWs in order to enable full integration of the Hyperledger Fabric components. Integration with the ramp-up configurator and Node-RED environment helped us to validate the role of our Hyperledger Fabric components in fast IoT system prototyping framework. We have identified and addressed all the requirements that our solution needs to fulfill in order to be an integral part of the AGILE fast IoT prototyping framework, thus bringing the blockchain technology closer to the IoT system integrators.
Achieved results and impact
We promote our solution as blockchain as a service (BaaS). Consequently, , “collective IoT” security and privacy management as a service is offered to IoT platform operators and system integrators. The VizLore IoT blockchain fabric can be deployed on IoT platforms (as part of VizLore IoT edge devices or hosted on 3rd party edge devices and servers) regardless whether or not their services actively use the blockchain applications. The VizLore federated Hyperledger fabric for IoT systems is actively being exploited as an integral part of the VizLore’s business strategy and IoT service offerings. Our Smart Access Control IoT service is enhanced with the Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts so that each virtual key is a smart contract stored on the federated blockchain fabric. This significantly enhances security and robustness, while providing solid ground for establishing innovative business models for entrance vouchers and remote access control.
Our Hyperledger agents, blockchain network generator, Node-RED component, and smart contract templates are available as part of the AGILE IoT software stack.

The
HAWK
project is about monitoring the
elderly living alone
through off-the-shelve movement sensors, through the development of a model of the elder’s home activity through artificial intelligence technologies. The activity being continuously acquired by the movements of the elder through their home (in his/her daily activities) is compared against the last trained model to provide insights about routines and deviations from “what has been learned”, in order to alert caregivers or professional service providers on warnings or alarms derived from those deviations.

The
HAWK
project is about monitoring the
elderly living alone
through off-the-shelve movement sensors, through the development of a model of the elder’s home activity through artificial intelligence technologies. The activity being continuously acquired by the movements of the elder through their home (in his/her daily activities) is compared against the last trained model to provide insights about routines and deviations from “what has been learned”, in order to alert caregivers or professional service providers on warnings or alarms derived from those deviations.
The architecture of the system is the combination of AGILE gateway and
S&C’s enControl IoT platform
and smart home solution. At the AGILE gateway, we have developed a protocol for a commercial movement detector device (PIR), that one may capture movement events detected to fit the activity model. The protocol has been encapsulated within a dedicated docker container, allowing any other AGILE component to work with the PIR sensor. The protocol pushes PIR events to enControl IoT platform,where the activity model has been developed and deployed. Results from the model evaluation against PIR events are broadcasted using messages in a pub/sub architecture within enControl. This pub/sub connectivity is used to connect this output back to AGILE (GW) by a developed microservice, so it can be exploited by other AGILE components. The microservice is also a docker container, and it opens a persistent connection to enControl by using lightweight web sockets technology allowing real-time server push updates.
enControl is constantly monitoring devices data received from the gateway and, for example, when an anomaly is detected, it’s pushed immediately to the HAWK notifier microservice who then proceeds to parse the data and store it in a local database.

AirEx
is a novel
smart home technology
that helps reducing the home’s heat demand, without compromising moisture build-up and subsequently damp and indoor air quality. AirEx uses smart sensors to monitor and analyse environmental conditions while its cloud-based algorithms determine the vent state to automatically regulate airflow. It uses AI to predict occupants’ behaviour and weather patterns for more efficient airflow optimisation. Via improved thermal efficiency of the building fabric,
the system can reduce heating energy bills by 15%
, which means 2-3 years payback. AirEx’s key customers are
Social Housing Associations
who have the mandate to improve the energy efficiency of their building stock.
Within the scope of Agile IoT project, we had the opportunity to develop standard APIs using Agile IoT to interact to our product, AirEx and make it therefore
more agnostic
with regards to integration with third party connected devices and infrastructure. During this project the key component we utilised is ‘Connectivity and Communication Protocols’, where we managed to extend this component via implementing agile-rfm69 protocol to communicate using
HopeRF RFM69 module
.
We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.
Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.
The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.
In the future we are keen to continue to use Agile-BLE in order to integrate additional sensors. In addition, once the Agile hub becomes LoRaWAN-enabled we will be very keen to explore the possibility of using Agile hub.
Our Software Lead is presenting some of the key outcomes of the project via this IoT Webinar:

Integrate Agile IoT gateways to Watson IoT platform
Posted on
12th December 2018
12th December 2018
Sensinov
is a start-up specializing in smart building and industrial IoT setups offering an interoperability as a service which aims at coping with huge device diversity, lifecycle management, and continuous operations of IoT solutions.
The diversity of devices and connectivity networks in smart building can only grow with new and emerging devices that are entering the mainstream. To ensure future proof and sustainable deployment of smart buildings, there is a need to:
Transform the collected data into uniform data formats
ensuring their proper handling by applications and IoT platforms. By doing so, the management of the life cycle (changing device vendor or changing IoT platform provider) becomes an easy task for IoT project owners.
Process the data locally
and send only processed/filtered data to the cloud. Indeed, huge amounts of data sets could be generated. It is neither beneficial nor economically viable to send all the data to the cloud. Processing data locally is an emerging technical and business imperative. It is usually performed through running application logic closer to the IoT devices: i.e. where the data is generated.
Sensinov was selected for an open call of H2020 Agile IoT project. Our role in the project was to integrate Agile IoT gateways in the
Watson IoT platform
. This was an excellent opportunity for Sensinov to demonstrate its interoperability platform in action. Among our findings:
Agile IoT provides us a perfect development environment to cope with industrial IoT requirements from real life projects.
These requirements include

The enhancement of efficiency through local processing
Device connectivity
Protocol adaptation
Data processing close to the devices
Securing IoT communications
Ensuring system extensibility through the installation of new applications
As a smart building specialist without any plan to build hardware, Agile IoT provides a perfect solution for deployment scenarios where the need to add a gateway is necessary with the absence of local and extensible local processing capabilities. Sensinov is currently considering the inclusion of an Agile IoT compatible gateway in its portfolio, partnering with a hardware player who adheres to the Agile IoT principles. In interest to our roadmap and strategy, Agile IoT offers us several interesting value propositions including:

Monitoring the Supply Chain of Bottled Wine with AGILE
Posted on
8th December 2018
8th December 2018
Maintaining appropriate conditions in the storage and transport of sensitive products is an age-old problem for
food supply chains
. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.
ISTMOS
monitoring platform allows the supply chain stakeholders of bottled wine to monitor the most critical parameters affecting wine quality during its storage and transportation. Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.
In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).
The results of the ISTMOS-AGILE integration have been evaluated through a pilot case study in collaboration with two large Greek wineries.
Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.

reduce the time-to-market for the applications built on-top-of Senseioty. We have also
benchmarked other gateways, but they usually lack the rapid and smooth integration of software components with third party systems.
In fact, at the software level, the Agile IoT stack provides data collection and management
capabilities on the gateway, an intuitive interface for device management, a visual workflow editor
for creating integration patterns with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for releasing the
resulting end-to-end applications. Senseioty generates data analytics applications and workflows
to be pushed as close as possible to the data sources and the devices, hence Agile IoT gateway represents
the perfect match to deploy secure, scalable and reliable Senseioty edge-computing applications.
The overall system resulting from the integration of the Agile IoT stack and Senseioty allows
application developers to rapidly create and deploy innovative IoT applications without the necessity to customize a given IoT platform which in turn,, saves development time and resources.
Moreover, FlairBit, as an IoT platform provider, can now benefit from the Agile IoT ecosystem as a
way to boost its user and developer base and create new revenue streams, since Senseioty can
now be exploited and used in innovative cross-domain applications.
Furthermore, , in accessing the Agile-IoT ecosystem, FlairBit benefits from the different competencies,
technologies, and use cases of the partners in the consortium. From a business perspective, it
allows the generation of partnership to speed-up the go-to-market strategy in new markets for FlairBit.
In fact, Agile-IoT provides an interoperability framework to enable IoT platforms to open up access
to their devices/services in a controlled and secure manner. This pursues the acquisition of new revenue
streams for offering added value services along with receiving missing ingredients that enrich
FlairBit business offerings.
To conclude, the open source software Agile-IoT consortium is developing with a business-friendly license that allows FlairBit’s Senseioty IoT platforms to be Agile-IoT compliant, and at the same time to remain proprietary which allows FlairBit to increase its own product value and unlocking potential businesses in new markets. Simultaneously, FlairBit open sourced software components extend the Agile IoT stack and enables Big-Data Analytics on-top-of Agile IoT gateway, based on open source technologies (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Beam).

Goodbye AGILE… Welcome AGAIL!
Posted on

1st March 2019
The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the

You always hear: “Data here. Data there.”
It’s funny that almost no one talks about Information, yet everyone is connecting more and more devices to the internet and storing their data.
And if they are not extracting information from that data, why bother storing it in the first place?

Using the AGILE framework to implement a Quantified Self application: Advantages and Challenges
Posted on
16th October 2017
16th October 2017
New biosensors are released daily promising to help us monitor important biosignal parameters. Until recently, lower priority has been given to interoperability while emphasis has been put on data collection, many times on remote servers without the level of guarantees that the user’s data will not be misused. The AGILE software stack with the component-based architecture and open source licensing and development model allows for the implementation of a fully-fledged gateway under the user’s control.
The proliferation of a multitude of biosignal sensors and activity trackers to gather user biosignal and wellness attributes poses unique challenges for their effective integration into user-centric applications which will provide valuable insights and promote healthy behaviors. Such sensors include
medical sensors
for biosignals such as heart-rate, oxygen saturation and weight, b)
trackers
measuring activity and steps, and c)
smartwatches
The architecture of the AGILE Software stack allows for the integration of new sensors increasing the usefulness of the Agile Gateway in many applications. In order to ease access to sensors data the Agile –IoT project has defined a set of REST commands which homogenize access to sensors. Unfortunately, due to the great variance of features and access protocols between devices, great effort is needed to integrate them via the implementation of corresponding device drivers but the architecture of the AGILE software stack aims to ease these difficulties. AGILE offers two methods of device integration:

Seconds can be the differentiator between fixed and broken, faulty -working, accident-good fortune , life or death.
Fog computing becomes the standard due to firstly having the need of information in real-time but simultaneously , the need of data to be correlated, something that is impossible, if our processing is centered in either our devices or our datacenter.
The Agile Gateway was incredible in assisting us to understand how we could bring this decentralized value to our business and platform which enabled us to offer a better service with better performance and responsiveness.

VizLore: Federated IoT blockchain fabric
Posted on
4th December 2018
8th December 2018
The overall objective of the extension project
VizLore Labs Foundation
(VLF) participated in the AGILE IoT second open call extension with the project titled “
Federated IoT blockchain fabric
Device based implementation
:
Implementation of device communication using existing AGILE PAN networking protocols. Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee are currently supported.
Sensor values from BLE devices can have various formats depending on the underlying parameter that is being measured. The values sent to the gateways can be sent as:
Single Measurements
:
The information of the measured parameter is fully described in a single transaction. Devices that send data in this way include blood pressure monitors and glucometers.
Multiple Measurements
:
Information is dependent upon a sequence of measured values in a specific timeframe ranging from seconds to hours. Devices which fall in this category include oximeters and ECGs.
Continuous Monitoring
:
In this case, data is sent to the gateway in real-time or stored continuously on the device until connectivity to the gateway is possible. Wearables (activity trackers and smartwatches) as well as sensors that monitor continuously various biosignals belong to this category.
The Quantified Self Application
The Quantified Self application uses the AGILE software stack to access data from the supported sensors. The application allows the user to monitor his activity against predefined goals. Sensor-based and cloud-sourced data can be used to quantify the progress.

The main objective of this extension project was to work on integrating
VizLore IoT platform with the AGILE IoT platform
through joint blockchain fabric based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric framework. The result is the first federated IoT blockchain established between two IoT platforms covering various IoT verticals. This integration enhances the AGILE IoT platform with robust blockchain enabled security and privacy policy enforcement framework while simultaneously broadening and enhancing the potential of the VizLore federated IoT blockchain solution.
Motivation behind the extension project
What the research community and industry are agreeing on is that IoT systems currently lack blockchain building frameworks which consider specific requirements of a typical IoT system including: a large number of microtransactions, unfeasible proof of work validation, real-time validation, avoiding large transaction fees, IoT specific smart contracts, high node churn in case of hosting ledger on end-user personal devices. To address these challenges, VizLore built the IoT blockchain framework (based on Hyperledger Fabric) which enables federation of blockchains across multiple IoT systems and platforms. In order to properly validate the federation potential, we required collaboration with an IoT platform provider who offers open software stack that is capable of hosting our software agents and focusing on the edge and fog components of IoT systems. The AGILE IoT fulfilled both requirements. IoT gateway software architecture is very similar to that of our IoT controllers and cloud platform. AGILE IoT focuses on building new IoT systems with specific configuration and deployment of IoT gateways. This proved to be an ideal blockchain federation enabler since each new gateway instance (on both AGILE and VizLore Labs end) introduces a new node into the federated blockchain architecture and enhances its distribution span and robustness. The AGILE IoT project pilots require innovative privacy management approaches which do not limit the business potential based on data sharing. The VizLore extension project also focused on producing a set of smart contract templates, specifically tailored for IoT business cases that are automatically stored on the federated blockchain. Therefore, the integration potential was very high and this remained true during the execution of the extension project.
Experience during the implementation of the extension project
During execution of the extension project and porting of the VizLore federated blockchain enablers onto the AGILE SW stack, we have worked most of the AGILE SW components and services (GW SE stack, ramp-up configurator, Node-RED, recommender system). The documentation and examples are excellent and allowed fast validation and prototyping. Together with the AGILE team, we have identified the need for supporting 64-bit OS architectures on AGILE GWs in order to enable full integration of the Hyperledger Fabric components. Integration with the ramp-up configurator and Node-RED environment helped us to validate the role of our Hyperledger Fabric components in fast IoT system prototyping framework. We have identified and addressed all the requirements that our solution needs to fulfill in order to be an integral part of the AGILE fast IoT prototyping framework, thus bringing the blockchain technology closer to the IoT system integrators.
Achieved results and impact
We promote our solution as blockchain as a service (BaaS). Consequently, , “collective IoT” security and privacy management as a service is offered to IoT platform operators and system integrators. The VizLore IoT blockchain fabric can be deployed on IoT platforms (as part of VizLore IoT edge devices or hosted on 3rd party edge devices and servers) regardless whether or not their services actively use the blockchain applications. The VizLore federated Hyperledger fabric for IoT systems is actively being exploited as an integral part of the VizLore’s business strategy and IoT service offerings. Our Smart Access Control IoT service is enhanced with the Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts so that each virtual key is a smart contract stored on the federated blockchain fabric. This significantly enhances security and robustness, while providing solid ground for establishing innovative business models for entrance vouchers and remote access control.
Our Hyperledger agents, blockchain network generator, Node-RED component, and smart contract templates are available as part of the AGILE IoT software stack.

HAWK project: monitoring elder people living alone
Posted on
4th December 2018
8th December 2018
The
HAWK
project is about monitoring the
elderly living alone
through off-the-shelve movement sensors, through the development of a model of the elder’s home activity through artificial intelligence technologies. The activity being continuously acquired by the movements of the elder through their home (in his/her daily activities) is compared against the last trained model to provide insights about routines and deviations from “what has been learned”, in order to alert caregivers or professional service providers on warnings or alarms derived from those deviations.
The architecture of the system is the combination of AGILE gateway and
S&C’s enControl IoT platform
and smart home solution. At the AGILE gateway, we have developed a protocol for a commercial movement detector device (PIR), that one may capture movement events detected to fit the activity model. The protocol has been encapsulated within a dedicated docker container, allowing any other AGILE component to work with the PIR sensor. The protocol pushes PIR events to enControl IoT platform,where the activity model has been developed and deployed. Results from the model evaluation against PIR events are broadcasted using messages in a pub/sub architecture within enControl. This pub/sub connectivity is used to connect this output back to AGILE (GW) by a developed microservice, so it can be exploited by other AGILE components. The microservice is also a docker container, and it opens a persistent connection to enControl by using lightweight web sockets technology allowing real-time server push updates.
enControl is constantly monitoring devices data received from the gateway and, for example, when an anomaly is detected, it’s pushed immediately to the HAWK notifier microservice who then proceeds to parse the data and store it in a local database.

An Overview of Research on Computational Resource Management in AGILE
Posted on
7th November 2018
21st November 2018
We would like to take this opportunity to illustrate the challenges related to computational resource consumption such as memory, CPU or networking, in our gateway setup. First and foremost, we must admit the utmost importance of ensuring that services provided by the gateway have reasonable use of the computational resources. This is how we can ensure that there is space available for applications using core services from AGILE. However, this is not the only reason to keep an eye on resource consumption. There are also security implications and economic reasons to monitor and control the use of resources, i.e. especially when computation should be offloaded to the cloud.
We will discuss the release of an open-source component to measure resource consumption in the gateway plus other scenarios. We will then explain how we have used this component in the scope of the project to perform several research tasks. Applications of the resource measurement component have been used to study resource abuse scenarios from the perspective of security, detection of crypto-miners, and evaluation of strategies to balance the computation load between the gateway and the cloud.

Project has delivered exceptional results with significant immediate or potential impact !
Posted on
4th April 2019
4th April 2019
Taking someone else’s place is never easy, especially when you are the project manager of a big H2020 EU project like AGILE (www.agile-iot.eu). However, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the exceptional people that are part of a great consortium (the researchers, developers, biz guys, who I now call friends), I can say that WE did it very well! To be clear, I was already aware of that, but to read the conclusion of the official final review from the EU Commission which says “
Project has delivered exceptional results with significant immediate or potential impact
” is priceless!!!
So now you are probably wondering what’s next, right? As I mentioned earlier, it’s time to say goodbye to AGILE ☹
This amazing project has run its course, as it happens to all EU projects. But (now you know that) AGILE is not just another EU project. This is one more thing that makes it unique. AGILE is not dead! It has simply changed its name into ECLIPSE AGAIL. From now on, it will be fully Open Source and hosted by the Eclipse IoT Working group.
Long live ECLIPSE AGAIL!
Feel free to try it, adopt it and contribute back to it here:

Yeon Sue Park is an anthropologist-artist based between Barcelona and Seoul. Exploration of the crossroads between anthropology and art is the first question of her artwork. Anthropological findings and insights bring to create a narrative, and languages and practices of art join it to represent the story. She uses installation, image, performance and writing in her work in order to investigate new forms of visual research and representation.
Souneil Park is a research scientist at Telefonica Research, working in the area of data mining, human-computer interaction, and information visualization. He was involved in a variety of projects, such as data driven analysis of driving behavior for intelligent car safety features, development of an interactive visual tool for analysing the diffusion of rumors and debunks in social media, design of an online news framework for exposing readers to diverse political perspectives.
Our collaborative work aims to communicate with a larger public, beyond artist groups or academia using a coherent and experimental language of expression.About the project:
About the project:
“Still touchable?” explores our relationships to information. The physical relationships we had with the media, such as letters, postcards, newspapers, CD, which started to disappear as the touch, feel, memories and emotions we had with them are disappearing. Instead, we CLICK. The omnipresence of screens where we click on has not helped us yet figure out the type of substance it has, the data. Are they material or immaterial? Do they truly exist? If so, where and how? Encountering this paradox of existence, we invite people to reflect on our physical relationship to the information: Who replaced our bookstores, record shop and post offices? And how? Can we recuperate our physical relationships with the information nowadays? Can they still be tangible and interactable? The public will ponder these questions in a space where our daily performance of producing and receiving information takes a physical form, and recall the interaction experiences of the past and contrast them.

IVI installation is a prototype of architectural experimental design and fabrication. It is the end-result of the architectural programme that was organized in Chania, Greece, by the Architectural Association, school of architecture in London, in October 2016. The intense programme focused its scientific approach in making use of advanced methodologies for architectural design, interactive spatial systems and digital methods for fabrication through a series of parametric morphologies and manipulation of space. Within a period of 10 days the design team researched, tested and realized the prototype.
Various cultural and environmental elements have been embedded within the design to promote a series of current issues of the contemporary way of thought. The fabrication of the prototype has been realized via a participatory process with a serial of comparative approach methods and multiple alternative experimentations that enabled a family of in-between sketches, drawings and models. The final prototype is made of 45 square meters of kite fabric held together by 400 meters of fiber. It is a light-weight structure, the form of which has been designed through the use of various computer software such as Autodesk Maya, Rhinoceros 5 and Grasshopper. The form is defined by two pumps that inflate it with air. The prototype’s interior is accessible and is where the users experience a series of projection simulations. These digital optical projections derive from the investigation of Chania’s urban fabric and aim to encourage relations of interaction and participation by the visitors, with the use of an AGILE powered Raspberry Pi microcontroller which allows for interaction via smart phone devices that change the projection on the specific mapped area.
AA Greece Programme Head: Alexandros Kallegias. AA VS Director: Christopher Pierce. Tutoring Team: Alexandros Kallegias, Yue Shi ,Pierre Bianchi. Interaction Collaborator: Charalampos Doukas. Fabrication Collaborator: Rallou Nikolaidou Participants: Konstantina Kousari, Evangelia Apostolaki, Paraskevi Malea, Maria Antoniou, Marianna Bagordaki, Styliani Michael, Joanne Spyridi, Kohei Morishita, Ioannis Mitsis, Georgios Sketopoulos, Spyridon Nikolopoulos, Georgios Vlasios Pakalidis, Zhuxi Zeng, Nikoletta Karastathi.

About the project:
The Fountains installation draws on open data sets of water pollution selected from specific locations around the globe to create data visualizations that transform the 3D scanned, virtual skin surfaces of people’s bodies to reflect the quality of their local water sources. The installation features audio recordings of interviews of people adversely affected by water pollution, as well as people living with fair water conditions. The audio of each person’s interview will match up with their corresponding virtual bodies as their skin textures transform.
The virtual bodies take form as sculptural video projections, rotating from one virtual body to the next in harmony with the changing water sources. Real-time turbidity data readings from the Great Lakes region in the US are fed to the AGILE gateway and provide an ever changing sound score.

About the project:
Floral Automaton is a sculptural device that grows flowers digitally. Using various sensors taken from Smart Cities technologies, it reacts and adapts itself to its environment in real time. Sensors are instruments that translate chemical or mechanical stimuli such as light, temperature, gas concentration, speed and vibration across analog and digital sensors into electrical resistors and voltage signal. Using the information collected by several sensors, Floral Automaton interprets our physical ‘decor’ to generate a computational environment. Enclosed within a 2.5 by 2.2 meters frame of steel, various electronic components are attached to a 2.3mm galvanized wire rope. Each of those components is programmed to preserve a balanced meteorological condition in order to display ‘4K time-lapse videos’ of blooming flowers.The information collected by the device becomes a material to mimic biological processes and question the authenticity of our surroundings. Floral Automaton explores the implications when environments become programmable and are made to be operational through sensor technologies.
With the generous help of Frank Kolkman

Category: Quantified-Self
Artists: Luisa Fabrizi (IT), Andre Landwehr (DE)
AGILE support partner: BioAssist
About the artist:
Luisa Fabrizi is an architect, interaction designer and artist based in Hamburg. Her artistic research is a constant speculation on the use of body data as a mean to reflect on human emotion and as an instrument of artistic self-expression. Her works are an effort of bridging between digital and analog, machines and humans, through a constant reflection on the use of space, new technologies and theorizations. She graduated as an architect in Rome (Italy) and as an interaction designer in Malmö (Sweden). Nowadays she is one of the artists in the Honigfabrik ateliers in Hamburg-Wilhemsburg and works as an exhibition designer for a German design office.
Andre Landwehr has a background in engineering and sustainable urban development, with a passion for programming and abstraction of reality into formulas or calculations. He loves to explore digital concepts that interact with the physical world. Together with Luisa he is developing the “E-Camera”.
Portfolio:
http://luisa-fabrizi.com
About the project:
A picture taken with a camera lets us see the world through a photographer’s eyes. But the options of representing the personal involvement with the photograph are restricted by the technical settings of a camera. The sensory extensions of the “E-Camera” allow the artist to add a further much more intimate and immediate component to her work enriching it with her emotions in the moment the picture’s taken.
“E-Camera” is communicating with biometric sensors that are attached to the photographer’s body. These sensors measure the photographer’s heart rate, body-temperature and galvanic value when taking a picture. All of these data strongly reflect the photographer’s emotions. Whenever the photographer takes a picture a software analyses the photographer’s momentary body data and remixes the picture in a way that resembles the original picture. Based on the body data the picture is enriched, almost distorted, by an evocative interpretation of the photographer’s emotional state.The use of “E-Camera” enables the photographer to reflect on her emotions and to actively embody them into the creative process of photography. In this
The use of “E-Camera” enables the photographer to reflect on her emotions and to actively embody them into the creative process of photography. In this way, the project “E-Camera” aspires to become a new way to consider photography and to reveal a new approach to the Quantified Self field. After the Adaptation exhibition, the project will be further developed to give more photographers the opportunity to explore the “E-Camera” for their artwork.
