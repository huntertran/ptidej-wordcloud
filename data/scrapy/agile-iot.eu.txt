AGILE builds a modular and adaptive gateway for IoT devices. Modularity at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired IoT networking technologies (e.g. KNX, ZWave, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, etc.) and allows fast prototyping of IoT solutions for various domains (e.g. home automation, environment monitoring, wearables, etc.). At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally. The AGILE software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps are recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.

Imagine being able to manage all your IoT devices from one place. The AGILE gateway helps you do that. With it you will be able to access and manage to your data locally, or send it to the cloud to check and share it wherever you are in the world!
Still not convinced? What if we told you that the most ambitious makers will also have the opportunity to create and run their own IoT apps through our visual environment and share them with the rest of our community!?
If you are getting started in the IoT world, you may think that this is not for you, since everything seems technical and complicated. Don’t worry, AGILE software can be auto-configured and adapted based on the hardware so that the entire setup is performed automatically for you! Forget about wiring, make it fast and easy, make it AGILE.

Taking someone else’s place is never easy, especially when you are the project manager of a big H2020 EU project like AGILE (www.agile-iot.eu). However, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the exceptional people that are part of a great consortium (the researchers, developers, biz guys, who I now call friends), I can say that WE did it very well! To be clear, I was already aware of that, but to read the conclusion of the official final review from the EU Commission which says “

Why Crowdfunding?
The makers’ world is constantly moving, with various contributors, new creations, new development technologies, and in some cases, smarter devices that improve our daily lives. Crowdfunding campaigns help bring these ideas to life. They are created to help those without enough resources to make their ideas progress and make them successful. This isn’t always an easy path. Reaching an overwhelming victory depends solely on the supporters.
Despite the risk, we, the AGILE consortium members are launching this Kickstarter campaign! Our objective isn’t to fund the project itself, but to bring the Internet of Things (IoT) closer to the makers with the AGILE platform. We aim to put forth a solution that encompasses most of the IoT aspects on the market to impact the future of IoT.

This amazing project has run its course, as it happens to all EU projects. But (now you know that) AGILE is not just another EU project. This is one more thing that makes it unique. AGILE is not dead! It has simply changed its name into ECLIPSE AGAIL. From now on, it will be fully Open Source and hosted by the Eclipse IoT Working group.
Long live ECLIPSE AGAIL!

Open Call #1
1st March 2019
The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the

Taking someone else’s place is never easy, especially when you are the project manager of a big H2020 EU project like AGILE (www.agile-iot.eu). However, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the exceptional people that are part of a great consortium (the researchers, developers, biz guys, who I now call friends), I can say that WE did it very well! To be clear, I was already aware of that, but to read the conclusion of the official final review from the EU Commission which says “

So now you are probably wondering what’s next, right? As I mentioned earlier, it’s time to say goodbye to AGILE ☹
This amazing project has run its course, as it happens to all EU projects. But (now you know that) AGILE is not just another EU project. This is one more thing that makes it unique. AGILE is not dead! It has simply changed its name into ECLIPSE AGAIL. From now on, it will be fully Open Source and hosted by the Eclipse IoT Working group.

Taking someone else’s place is never easy, especially when you are the project manager of a big H2020 EU project like AGILE (www.agile-iot.eu). However, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the exceptional people that are part of a great consortium (the researchers, developers, biz guys, who I now call friends), I can say that WE did it very well! To be clear, I was already aware of that, but to read the conclusion of the official final review from the EU Commission which says “

We have developed a maker-friendly IoT gateway that will help get you to the forefront of IoT communications. This open source device has huge potential and you can now get one by supporting our
Kickstarter campaign
Overview
The AGILE IoT consortium is looking for companies to evolve and enhance their unique gateway software and find new hardware applications for it. The selected applicants will receive a subgrant (equity-free) of 50.000€.

This report forms part of the contractual deliverables of the AGILE H2020 EC-funded project. It documents the results from the analysis of available IoT Standards and protocols (for IoT and Machine-to-Machine communication) that will be integrated within AGILE for maximising the connected device support and interoperability. Support of the selected protocols (for integration in various layers such as the operating system, device management and the userspace) is assessed for features such as device discovery, communication and, additionally, utilisation of external protocols (e.g. for messaging).
In addition, the deliverable illustrates a process for auto-configuring hardware modules within the gateway, focusing on the configuration steps required during the deployment of the gateway and on the resource optimisation at runtime. This will allow the AGILE gateway to be autoconfigured based on the application context and user preferences. A preliminary mechanism to implement the configurator service is documented herein. A more detailed documentation of the configuration, will be presented in deliverable D2.2 (initial version of Gateway Selfconfiguration, IoT Device discovery & Remote gateway management).

D3.3 Application Interfaces (Gateway, Data Management & Developer’s Interface)
This deliverable presents how the AGILE software stack integrates components developed by the consortium and additional open source components into a modular framework, and how this framework is exposed to the user through the AGILE Graphical User Interface (GUI). In addition, it describes some non-GUI related elements that were not documented in previous deliverables, namely: how Kura is integrated with the AGILE framework; the local data storage API; and the JavaScript AGILE SDK. The document has been further edited since version one, to address feedback from AGILE project reviewers.

So now you are probably wondering what’s next, right? As I mentioned earlier, it’s time to say goodbye to AGILE ☹
This amazing project has run its course, as it happens to all EU projects. But (now you know that) AGILE is not just another EU project. This is one more thing that makes it unique. AGILE is not dead! It has simply changed its name into ECLIPSE AGAIL. From now on, it will be fully Open Source and hosted by the Eclipse IoT Working group.
.
We were glad of finding the Agile Open Call. It was a perfect timing for us since we were planning to work on an evolution of our current suite of robots for toddlers with a more intelligent one. It was a perfect match, since we already had a product in the market with some units (about 5,000) upgradeable to be connected to the cloud. By using AGILE stack, we obtained a framework to have things done. The initial learning curve was a bit tough but we quickly take over thanks to the support of the AGILE tech team. We met some challenges regarding the hardware requirements, as to run the Java version of AGILE, since our hardware setup, although powerful, it was tightened by low-price requirements to meet market constrains. The AGILE consortium understood perfectly the situation and both parties agreed to reshape the initial scope of our proposal. We developed a lightweight C++ implementation of AGILE core components, following the same architectural pattern as in the Java version. With this contribution the AGILE project is now able to support more hardware devices as i.e. Raspberry Pi Zero.
Still not convinced? What if we told you that the most ambitious makers will also have the opportunity to create and run their own IoT apps through our visual environment and share them with the rest of our community!?
If you are getting started in the IoT world, you may think that this is not for you, since everything seems technical and complicated. Don’t worry, AGILE software can be auto-configured and adapted based on the hardware so that the entire setup is performed automatically for you! Forget about wiring, make it fast and easy, make it AGILE.

It’s funny that almost no one talks about Information, yet everyone is connecting more and more devices to the internet and storing their data.
And if they are not extracting information from that data, why bother storing it in the first place?
Seconds can be the differentiator between fixed and broken, faulty -working, accident-good fortune , life or death.
The Adaptation Exhibition finally come and gone, and it was GREAT!
I was a little bit nervous when I arrived in Berlin last week. Actually, I knew that when we selected the artistic projects last winter, that we were not really ready to share the AGILE code: the documentation was missing, the code was not stable, and the integration was not really effective. So, sharing the AGILE software in such context was risky, especially sharing it with people without a strong IoT background.

The makers’ world is constantly moving, with various contributors, new creations, new development technologies, and in some cases, smarter devices that improve our daily lives. Crowdfunding campaigns help bring these ideas to life. They are created to help those without enough resources to make their ideas progress and make them successful. This isn’t always an easy path. Reaching an overwhelming victory depends solely on the supporters.
Despite the risk, we, the AGILE consortium members are launching this Kickstarter campaign! Our objective isn’t to fund the project itself, but to bring the Internet of Things (IoT) closer to the makers with the AGILE platform. We aim to put forth a solution that encompasses most of the IoT aspects on the market to impact the future of IoT.

Monitoring the Supply Chain of Bottled Wine with AGILE
Posted on
8th December 2018
Fog computing becomes the standard due to firstly having the need of information in real-time but simultaneously , the need of data to be correlated, something that is impossible, if our processing is centered in either our devices or our datacenter.
The Agile Gateway was incredible in assisting us to understand how we could bring this decentralized value to our business and platform which enabled us to offer a better service with better performance and responsiveness.
All the artists stepped up to the task with great artistic ideas and a technical person on their team. So, not only did they have the support of some AGILE partners like Libelium, BioAssist, or ATOS, but they also received everyday support from colleagues, friends and spouses.

The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the

. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.

. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.

Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.

In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.

Gateway Security, Data Provenance & Access Control (WP5)
D5.3 Secure Data Sharing
Data sharing is a key element of IoT environments; however, security and privacy concerns can diminish the potential of certain applications as users are reluctant to give data to third parties unconditionally. This deliverable describes how the AGILE security framework supports data sharing mechanisms while offering security assurances to users storing information on the gateway or sharing it with external systems.
First of all we explain enforcement mechanisms applied within the gateway. Those include enforcement points to ensure authorised access to container APIs, encryption of data stored within the gateway, and a policy decision point that can be used from applications running within or outside of the gateway.
Afterward, we explain mechanisms supporting use cases when data needs to be sent or received to/from external systems. For instance, AGILE offers a one-time token mechanism allowing external devices to authenticate in a lightweight manner towards the gateway. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in resource constrained devices, we implemented the client-side mechanism to generate tokens on RIOT (an OS for the IoT).
With regard to outsourcing data to external systems, we developed an SQL connector. This connector allows AGILE users to apply policies based on tables and actions performed on them when an application executes database queries. More importantly, when used in combination with CryptDB (an existing encrypted database), this connector can be used to offload data storage and querying computational resources to more powerful servers, yet without letting the external service to see the data in plain text. This is possible because information is encrypted before it is shared with external services.

maximize project impact by engaging external entities (startups and/or SMEs) to build solutions on top of AGILE software and hardware.
The first Agile IoT Open Call aims to foster and further the creation of an ecosystem surrounding the AGILE solutions. In particular from the hardware point of view, applicants will be required to exploit AGILE hardware modularity and extend its capabilities. From a software point of view, applicants will be required to exploit AGILE development environment and implement specific business logic, analytics software, new added value services, management and maintenance solutions, etc., which enhance their core value proposition in the IoT domain while also demonstrating value for usability of AGILE software solutions. Successful applicants may also extend the existing pilots with additional deployments and with the establishment of new-ones.

To offer a wide range of integration possibilities, we do not only describe how to interact with a structured query language in a secure manner; on the contrary, we also include an approach that enables developers to apply policies on any kind of data they need to process. To this end, we created a sample application that is easily extensible and documents how to use the policy decision points from AGILE in different scenarios. These scenarios range from operating on an in-memory array of objects to obtaining information from external HTTP endpoints, e.g. github API, and applying policies on it.

This document discusses the goal of usage control and monitoring of security-sensitive actions executed on the gateway.
This deliverable describes how usage control and monitoring is achieved through the implementation of the AGILE security architecture. To this end, the security architecture is placed in the big picture of the AGILE project, and the location of the enforcement points required to achieve proper access and usage control of the data is covered herein. Additionally, this report illustrates how monitoring of actions to track provenance of data access gives insights to security-aware users on how systems interacting with the gateway APIs act on their behalf and access their data.
From the technical perspective, the policy language used by AGILE and the evaluation of the security policies with their dimensions are discussed. Later sections describe how the desired role-based access control model presented in earlier deliverables has been implemented on top of our generic attribute-based security architecture. More importantly, this document clarifies how the role-based access control currently configured by default for the gateway is realised by explaining entity definitions and their policies. The aforementioned role-based access control mechanisms serve as the foundation to apply policies capable of ensuring proper usage control on the gateway’s data. This takes place through a flexible policy framework implemented based on usage lock policies.

The analysis of collected IoT data allows for early detection of critical situations and health risk factors, wandering beyond facilities, emergency alarms, deviations in physical activity patterns analysis and others. Based on this, inCare Together creates automatic reports for authorized caregivers (family members, nurses, doctors) that can be accessed via web or delivered to their email accounts.
inCare Together is going to be marketed as a monthly/yearly subscription service. Benefits unlocked: Seniors are more well protected and feel more independent while their caregivers gain piece of mind about the seniors’ whereabouts and physical wellbeing, freeing up time and resources for other duties, instantly and accurately being notified about critical events. Also, nursing organizations reduce effort and costs associated to seniors’ everyday monitoring, thus contributing to health system sustainability.

For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.

The EU funded AGILE project is over. Somewhere I read that projects are like villains in horror movies: they just won’t die. Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT! And no, AGILE won’t die, exactly as these villains of horror movies: it will stay alive through the

Maintaining appropriate conditions in the storage and transport of sensitive products is an age-old problem for
food supply chains
. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.

One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.
Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.

Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.
In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.

Motivation behind the extension project
What the research community and industry are agreeing on is that IoT systems currently lack blockchain building frameworks which consider specific requirements of a typical IoT system including: a large number of microtransactions, unfeasible proof of work validation, real-time validation, avoiding large transaction fees, IoT specific smart contracts, high node churn in case of hosting ledger on end-user personal devices. To address these challenges, VizLore built the IoT blockchain framework (based on Hyperledger Fabric) which enables federation of blockchains across multiple IoT systems and platforms. In order to properly validate the federation potential, we required collaboration with an IoT platform provider who offers open software stack that is capable of hosting our software agents and focusing on the edge and fog components of IoT systems. The AGILE IoT fulfilled both requirements. IoT gateway software architecture is very similar to that of our IoT controllers and cloud platform. AGILE IoT focuses on building new IoT systems with specific configuration and deployment of IoT gateways. This proved to be an ideal blockchain federation enabler since each new gateway instance (on both AGILE and VizLore Labs end) introduces a new node into the federated blockchain architecture and enhances its distribution span and robustness. The AGILE IoT project pilots require innovative privacy management approaches which do not limit the business potential based on data sharing. The VizLore extension project also focused on producing a set of smart contract templates, specifically tailored for IoT business cases that are automatically stored on the federated blockchain. Therefore, the integration potential was very high and this remained true during the execution of the extension project.

Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).
The results of the ISTMOS-AGILE integration have been evaluated through a pilot case study in collaboration with two large Greek wineries.

As a smart building specialist without any plan to build hardware, Agile IoT provides a perfect solution for deployment scenarios where the need to add a gateway is necessary with the absence of local and extensible local processing capabilities. Sensinov is currently considering the inclusion of an Agile IoT compatible gateway in its portfolio, partnering with a hardware player who adheres to the Agile IoT principles. In interest to our roadmap and strategy, Agile IoT offers us several interesting value propositions including:

Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.

During execution of the extension project and porting of the VizLore federated blockchain enablers onto the AGILE SW stack, we have worked most of the AGILE SW components and services (GW SE stack, ramp-up configurator, Node-RED, recommender system). The documentation and examples are excellent and allowed fast validation and prototyping. Together with the AGILE team, we have identified the need for supporting 64-bit OS architectures on AGILE GWs in order to enable full integration of the Hyperledger Fabric components. Integration with the ramp-up configurator and Node-RED environment helped us to validate the role of our Hyperledger Fabric components in fast IoT system prototyping framework. We have identified and addressed all the requirements that our solution needs to fulfill in order to be an integral part of the AGILE fast IoT prototyping framework, thus bringing the blockchain technology closer to the IoT system integrators.

We promote our solution as blockchain as a service (BaaS). Consequently, , “collective IoT” security and privacy management as a service is offered to IoT platform operators and system integrators. The VizLore IoT blockchain fabric can be deployed on IoT platforms (as part of VizLore IoT edge devices or hosted on 3rd party edge devices and servers) regardless whether or not their services actively use the blockchain applications. The VizLore federated Hyperledger fabric for IoT systems is actively being exploited as an integral part of the VizLore’s business strategy and IoT service offerings. Our Smart Access Control IoT service is enhanced with the Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts so that each virtual key is a smart contract stored on the federated blockchain fabric. This significantly enhances security and robustness, while providing solid ground for establishing innovative business models for entrance vouchers and remote access control.
Our Hyperledger agents, blockchain network generator, Node-RED component, and smart contract templates are available as part of the AGILE IoT software stack.

Even when you’ve doused them in gasoline, set them on fire, then dumped them in a river…well, they just keep coming back! This is the case of the AGILE project: you can change the Project Officer, the Project Coordinator, some Partners, some Pilot (…or anything else, given it starts with a P 😀 ), but you cannot change the pioneering and outstanding contribution it gave to the definition of a fully open-source and modular gateway for the IoT!

We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.

Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.
The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.

It is the end-result of the architectural programme that was organized in Chania, Greece, by the Architectural Association, school of architecture in London, in October 2016. The intense programme focused its scientific approach in making use of advanced methodologies for architectural design, interactive spatial systems and digital methods for fabrication through a series of parametric morphologies and manipulation of space. Within a period of 10 days the design team researched, tested and realized the prototype.

FlairBit business offerings.
To conclude, the open source software Agile-IoT consortium is developing with a business-friendly license that allows FlairBit’s Senseioty IoT platforms to be Agile-IoT compliant, and at the same time to remain proprietary which allows FlairBit to increase its own product value and unlocking potential businesses in new markets. Simultaneously, FlairBit open sourced software components extend the Agile IoT stack and enables Big-Data Analytics on-top-of Agile IoT gateway, based on open source technologies (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Beam).

Being a software company, one of the key challenges we face on a regular basis is on how to design and develop custom hardware components in order to either explore new services or accommodate specific customer needs. This typically involves specific hardware and IoT devices to be integrated. With the IoT ecosystem comprising many hundreds of new players offering one or two parts of the IoT puzzle, finding the right hardware + software solution is often a time-consuming task, especially for small companies like Thinkinside.
The Agile project allowed us to tackle one of the key pain points of ICT companies working in the IoT+retail sector, and in particular

and smart home solution. At the AGILE gateway, we have developed a protocol for a commercial movement detector device (PIR), that one may capture movement events detected to fit the activity model. The protocol has been encapsulated within a dedicated docker container, allowing any other AGILE component to work with the PIR sensor. The protocol pushes PIR events to enControl IoT platform,where the activity model has been developed and deployed. Results from the model evaluation against PIR events are broadcasted using messages in a pub/sub architecture within enControl. This pub/sub connectivity is used to connect this output back to AGILE (GW) by a developed microservice, so it can be exploited by other AGILE components. The microservice is also a docker container, and it opens a persistent connection to enControl by using lightweight web sockets technology allowing real-time server push updates.

The goal of this deliverable is to provide a baseline for the exploitation management of AGILE. In this first iteration, the focus is on the innovation potential the individual project partners see for AGILE as an opportunity to explore alternative exploitation and monetization paths, or to enhance existing ones. In order to achieve a structured overview, a business model validation tool is introduced and applied to each participating partner in AGILE. The tool identifies each partners’ envisaged customer segments, their common need, the value promise of the solution, the technical aspects involved, the value network of stakeholders, the identifiable competition and the potential financial model. Each of these aspects is briefly explained with the goal of providing a starting point for later iterations of this deliverable.

Challenge
One of the challenges of living in countries with poor infrastructure, human inaccessible places, or areas of natural catastrophes is that more often than not, there is little or no Internet access. This restriction makes it challenging when trying to gather, arrange, and access data. You might ask why this data is important and how it would be used? Well, for starters it would help the residents align their resources, monitor live stock and protect endangered species.

We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.

The initial conclusions show that various partners in the project have compatible customer segments and value propositions that revolve around the AGILE solution. This compatibility is important, as it will allow individual partners to exploit results from the project in their respective businesses: it is clear that the integrated solution that AGILE promises to be will be exploitable as such, but at the same time it will allow several partners to build on and exploit the results even without a further commercialised, integrated platform.

The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.
In the future we are keen to continue to use Agile-BLE in order to integrate additional sensors. In addition, once the Agile hub becomes LoRaWAN-enabled we will be very keen to explore the possibility of using Agile hub.

We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.

Orange, i-Minds and Rombit participate in the Agile European Horizon 2020 project in order to investigate how drones can be used in case of a fire, explosion or other incident in the Antwerp Port regions. How can drones be deployed to get a better insight in the situation even before the emergency services arrive by using sensors and images sent through the Agile gateway and over the Orange 4G network in real time. More use cases in safety and environment are considered, which is one of the AGILE Pilot Projects, Air Quality and Pollution Monitoring.

You always hear: “Data here. Data there.”
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.
Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.

It’s funny that almost no one talks about Information, yet everyone is connecting more and more devices to the internet and storing their data.
And if they are not extracting information from that data, why bother storing it in the first place?
The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.
In the future we are keen to continue to use Agile-BLE in order to integrate additional sensors. In addition, once the Agile hub becomes LoRaWAN-enabled we will be very keen to explore the possibility of using Agile hub.

D2.1 Core requirements specification and IoT protocol integration
This report forms part of the contractual deliverables of the AGILE H2020 EC-funded project. It documents the results from the analysis of available IoT Standards and protocols (for IoT and Machine-to-Machine communication) that will be integrated within AGILE for maximising the connected device support and interoperability. Support of the selected protocols (for integration in various layers such as the operating system, device management and the userspace) is assessed for features such as device discovery, communication and, additionally, utilisation of external protocols (e.g. for messaging).

Seconds can be the differentiator between fixed and broken, faulty -working, accident-good fortune , life or death.
Fog computing becomes the standard due to firstly having the need of information in real-time but simultaneously , the need of data to be correlated, something that is impossible, if our processing is centered in either our devices or our datacenter.
The Agile Gateway was incredible in assisting us to understand how we could bring this decentralized value to our business and platform which enabled us to offer a better service with better performance and responsiveness.

In addition, the deliverable illustrates a process for auto-configuring hardware modules within the gateway, focusing on the configuration steps required during the deployment of the gateway and on the resource optimisation at runtime. This will allow the AGILE gateway to be autoconfigured based on the application context and user preferences. A preliminary mechanism to implement the configurator service is documented herein. A more detailed documentation of the configuration, will be presented in deliverable D2.2 (initial version of Gateway Selfconfiguration, IoT Device discovery & Remote gateway management).

To conclude, the open source software Agile-IoT consortium is developing with a business-friendly license that allows FlairBit’s Senseioty IoT platforms to be Agile-IoT compliant, and at the same time to remain proprietary which allows FlairBit to increase its own product value and unlocking potential businesses in new markets. Simultaneously, FlairBit open sourced software components extend the Agile IoT stack and enables Big-Data Analytics on-top-of Agile IoT gateway, based on open source technologies (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Beam).

The goal of this deliverable is to provide an additional layer for the exploitation management of AGILE and enable exploitation planning. In this second iteration, the focus is put on the exploitation opportunities for each pilot conducted within AGILE to explore avenues for monetization and go-to-market strategies. To build up on the Business Modelling assessment from the first iteration of this deliverable, a stakeholder-based business modelling approach was chosen to define the business model scenarios of the single pilots as archetypes for AGILE exploitation possibilities. The approach defines the stakeholder environment in which the AGILE-driven solutions of the pilots are integrated and then defines which stakeholders could provide revenue to make the solution sustainable and which users would have to cooperate in order for the pilot-specific business models to be sustainable a the targeted market.

The business model solutions were drafted collaboratively in a workshop on the consortium meeting in Q1 2017 and refined afterwards. The initial conclusions from the business modelling exercise and following research show that each pilot has solid exploitation options and a variety of stakeholder that are likely to provide a sustainable inflow of revenue. The diversity of the pilot business models shows how flexibly AGILE can be deployed, without being limited to a specific application or a specific domain.

This deliverable presents how the AGILE software stack integrates components developed by the consortium and additional open source components into a modular framework, and how this framework is exposed to the user through the AGILE Graphical User Interface (GUI). In addition, it describes some non-GUI related elements that were not documented in previous deliverables, namely: how Kura is integrated with the AGILE framework; the local data storage API; and the JavaScript AGILE SDK. The document has been further edited since version one, to address feedback from AGILE project reviewers.

We found that the communications component has a reasonable API and there is existing support for a number of useful technologies. For example, it provides a useful outline for integrating BLE sensors within Linux. During this Agile IoT project we have successfully developed communication protocols with Bluetooth-enabled low energy temperature and humidity sensors, which is a significant step in our development considering the increased need for connected devices.
One of the main benefits of using Agile IoT was that it did not require much effort for actual deployment: once the system is working, deploying new devices via resin.io requires minimal effort, since new devices will pull down the appropriate images automatically.

Furthermore, the use of Agile IoT does not require much memory: containers use limited RAM, some as little as 20MB and hence it works very efficiently on a Raspberry Pi. Nor did we experience any processor issues with using Agile IoT on Raspberry Pi 3 or even on Pi Zero.
The critical requirements are stability of the platform, extensibility and the ability to update remotely – all of which have been successfully managed using Agile IoT.

We would like to take this opportunity to illustrate the challenges related to computational resource consumption such as memory, CPU or networking, in our gateway setup. First and foremost, we must admit the utmost importance of ensuring that services provided by the gateway have reasonable use of the computational resources. This is how we can ensure that there is space available for applications using core services from AGILE. However, this is not the only reason to keep an eye on resource consumption. There are also security implications and economic reasons to monitor and control the use of resources, i.e. especially when computation should be offloaded to the cloud.
We will discuss the release of an open-source component to measure resource consumption in the gateway plus other scenarios. We will then explain how we have used this component in the scope of the project to perform several research tasks. Applications of the resource measurement component have been used to study resource abuse scenarios from the perspective of security, detection of crypto-miners, and evaluation of strategies to balance the computation load between the gateway and the cloud.

D5.3 Secure Data Sharing
Data sharing is a key element of IoT environments; however, security and privacy concerns can diminish the potential of certain applications as users are reluctant to give data to third parties unconditionally. This deliverable describes how the AGILE security framework supports data sharing mechanisms while offering security assurances to users storing information on the gateway or sharing it with external systems.
A set of new presentations are published. They describe the progress and the achievements of the AGILE-IoT project during the last 18 months.

. The reason is usually the lack of dedicated IoT solutions which do not require complex house renovations and high initial investments. The lack of connected home technologies turns out to be a missed opportunity for the owner or manager to save energy, money, and time and to simplify the management of the property.

The main objective of this extension project was to work on integrating
VizLore IoT platform with the AGILE IoT platform
through joint blockchain fabric based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric framework. The result is the first federated IoT blockchain established between two IoT platforms covering various IoT verticals. This integration enhances the AGILE IoT platform with robust blockchain enabled security and privacy policy enforcement framework while simultaneously broadening and enhancing the potential of the VizLore federated IoT blockchain solution.

First of all we explain enforcement mechanisms applied within the gateway. Those include enforcement points to ensure authorised access to container APIs, encryption of data stored within the gateway, and a policy decision point that can be used from applications running within or outside of the gateway.
Afterward, we explain mechanisms supporting use cases when data needs to be sent or received to/from external systems. For instance, AGILE offers a one-time token mechanism allowing external devices to authenticate in a lightweight manner towards the gateway. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in resource constrained devices, we implemented the client-side mechanism to generate tokens on RIOT (an OS for the IoT).

) wants to solve this problem and has developed
ELIO
, an IoT solution which reduces the energy expenses in vacation rental properties thanks to the automation of air-conditioning and heating based on presence detection technology. The system includes two devices developed by Modosmart, namely a window sensor and a room sensor unit which includes presence detection and temperature and humidity sensing. The devices are in pre-commercial state, tested and validated with a set of early adopters. They use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication. In addition, the solution is equipped with an off-the-shelf air-conditioning controller able to control any type of infrared based A/C split machine.
Modosmart was selected as one of the eight startups awarded in the first open call launched by the Agile-IoT project and which had proposed project ideas to integrate the Agile-IoT gateway into existing IoT solutions. Our project aimed to integrate the Agile-IoT gateway hardware and software stack into the Elio solution.

With regard to outsourcing data to external systems, we developed an SQL connector. This connector allows AGILE users to apply policies based on tables and actions performed on them when an application executes database queries. More importantly, when used in combination with CryptDB (an existing encrypted database), this connector can be used to offload data storage and querying computational resources to more powerful servers, yet without letting the external service to see the data in plain text. This is possible because information is encrypted before it is shared with external services.
To offer a wide range of integration possibilities, we do not only describe how to interact with a structured query language in a secure manner; on the contrary, we also include an approach that enables developers to apply policies on any kind of data they need to process. To this end, we created a sample application that is easily extensible and documents how to use the policy decision points from AGILE in different scenarios. These scenarios range from operating on an in-memory array of objects to obtaining information from external HTTP endpoints, e.g. github API, and applying policies on it.

The project started on the 1st of January and ended on the 30th of June. During the first half of the project there has been a thorough analysis of the gateway stack with the aim to allow the gateway to speak with the custom devices developed by Modosmart. The outcome of this phase was a proof of concept demo showing the gateway communicating with an ESP32 board, equipped with BLE communication and using the same Nordic nrf51822 microcontroller used in our custom BLE devices.
During the second three months of the project, the proof of concept board has been replaced by the real devices of the Elio solution. At the end of this phase the gateway was able to collect presence, temperature and humidity data from the room sensor unit, to monitor weather a window is open or close and to control the air-conditioning by speaking to the off-the-shelf controller.

What the research community and industry are agreeing on is that IoT systems currently lack blockchain building frameworks which consider specific requirements of a typical IoT system including: a large number of microtransactions, unfeasible proof of work validation, real-time validation, avoiding large transaction fees, IoT specific smart contracts, high node churn in case of hosting ledger on end-user personal devices. To address these challenges, VizLore built the IoT blockchain framework (based on Hyperledger Fabric) which enables federation of blockchains across multiple IoT systems and platforms. In order to properly validate the federation potential, we required collaboration with an IoT platform provider who offers open software stack that is capable of hosting our software agents and focusing on the edge and fog components of IoT systems. The AGILE IoT fulfilled both requirements. IoT gateway software architecture is very similar to that of our IoT controllers and cloud platform. AGILE IoT focuses on building new IoT systems with specific configuration and deployment of IoT gateways. This proved to be an ideal blockchain federation enabler since each new gateway instance (on both AGILE and VizLore Labs end) introduces a new node into the federated blockchain architecture and enhances its distribution span and robustness. The AGILE IoT project pilots require innovative privacy management approaches which do not limit the business potential based on data sharing. The VizLore extension project also focused on producing a set of smart contract templates, specifically tailored for IoT business cases that are automatically stored on the federated blockchain. Therefore, the integration potential was very high and this remained true during the execution of the extension project.

The aim of this deliverable is to present the results from the analysis of requirements and the design specifications providing a first insight on the utilization and validation of the AGILE solution in the project’s pilots. The cornerstone for the requirements elicitation and the pilots definition has been the early engagement of all the project stakeholders into the pilots execution. The deliverable highlights the initial inputs on pilots and technical deals concerning the components definition and pilot preparation as part of the overall AGILE pilots execution and evaluation methodology.

Thanks to the collaboration with the Agile-IoT project and to the received funding, the Elio solution is now able to rely on a modular, robust and flexible gateway which can accelerate the time-to-market. The modularity, robustness and flexibility is a result of the fact that the Agile-IoT gateway is built on top of a Docker containerized system powered by ResinOS, which is an operating system bringing the containerization approach to embedded systems. The benefits of using a modular containerized framework is demonstrated by the fact that by developing our own container we have been able to connect the Agile-IoT gateway to our devices without any modification to the other parts of the system.
26th January 2018
During execution of the extension project and porting of the VizLore federated blockchain enablers onto the AGILE SW stack, we have worked most of the AGILE SW components and services (GW SE stack, ramp-up configurator, Node-RED, recommender system). The documentation and examples are excellent and allowed fast validation and prototyping. Together with the AGILE team, we have identified the need for supporting 64-bit OS architectures on AGILE GWs in order to enable full integration of the Hyperledger Fabric components. Integration with the ramp-up configurator and Node-RED environment helped us to validate the role of our Hyperledger Fabric components in fast IoT system prototyping framework. We have identified and addressed all the requirements that our solution needs to fulfill in order to be an integral part of the AGILE fast IoT prototyping framework, thus bringing the blockchain technology closer to the IoT system integrators.

This deliverable describes how usage control and monitoring is achieved through the implementation of the AGILE security architecture. To this end, the security architecture is placed in the big picture of the AGILE project, and the location of the enforcement points required to achieve proper access and usage control of the data is covered herein. Additionally, this report illustrates how monitoring of actions to track provenance of data access gives insights to security-aware users on how systems interacting with the gateway APIs act on their behalf and access their data.
From the technical perspective, the policy language used by AGILE and the evaluation of the security policies with their dimensions are discussed. Later sections describe how the desired role-based access control model presented in earlier deliverables has been implemented on top of our generic attribute-based security architecture. More importantly, this document clarifies how the role-based access control currently configured by default for the gateway is realised by explaining entity definitions and their policies. The aforementioned role-based access control mechanisms serve as the foundation to apply policies capable of ensuring proper usage control on the gateway’s data. This takes place through a flexible policy framework implemented based on usage lock policies.

our experience at EclipseCon France 2017
We promote our solution as blockchain as a service (BaaS). Consequently, , “collective IoT” security and privacy management as a service is offered to IoT platform operators and system integrators. The VizLore IoT blockchain fabric can be deployed on IoT platforms (as part of VizLore IoT edge devices or hosted on 3rd party edge devices and servers) regardless whether or not their services actively use the blockchain applications. The VizLore federated Hyperledger fabric for IoT systems is actively being exploited as an integral part of the VizLore’s business strategy and IoT service offerings. Our Smart Access Control IoT service is enhanced with the Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts so that each virtual key is a smart contract stored on the federated blockchain fabric. This significantly enhances security and robustness, while providing solid ground for establishing innovative business models for entrance vouchers and remote access control.

The AGILE consortium had its quarterly plenary meeting at the end of March in Graz, Austria. FBK / Create-Net, AGILE project leader, took advantage of this opportunity to ask each of the partners to create a demonstration focusing on one aspect of the project for which they were responsible or involved. This resulted in an excellent demo session where we were able to take the pulse of the project.

The AGILE team participated in
IoT-EPI Review and TF Meeting in Athens
and discussed the progress and the advancement of the project towards the realization of a modern IoT gateway. Through demonstrations on an AGILE-based Monitoring Station and a Quantified-self application, the unique features of the hardware and software of the AGILE Gateway have been presented to the EC Project officers and reviewers. as well as to participants from other projects of the IoT European Platforms Initiative.
The architecture of the system is the combination of AGILE gateway and
S&C’s enControl IoT platform
and smart home solution. At the AGILE gateway, we have developed a protocol for a commercial movement detector device (PIR), that one may capture movement events detected to fit the activity model. The protocol has been encapsulated within a dedicated docker container, allowing any other AGILE component to work with the PIR sensor. The protocol pushes PIR events to enControl IoT platform,where the activity model has been developed and deployed. Results from the model evaluation against PIR events are broadcasted using messages in a pub/sub architecture within enControl. This pub/sub connectivity is used to connect this output back to AGILE (GW) by a developed microservice, so it can be exploited by other AGILE components. The microservice is also a docker container, and it opens a persistent connection to enControl by using lightweight web sockets technology allowing real-time server push updates.

and send only processed/filtered data to the cloud. Indeed, huge amounts of data sets could be generated. It is neither beneficial nor economically viable to send all the data to the cloud. Processing data locally is an emerging technical and business imperative. It is usually performed through running application logic closer to the IoT devices: i.e. where the data is generated.
Sensinov was selected for an open call of H2020 Agile IoT project. Our role in the project was to integrate Agile IoT gateways in the
Watson IoT platform
. This was an excellent opportunity for Sensinov to demonstrate its interoperability platform in action. Among our findings:

D6.4 Innovation and Exploitation Report 1
The goal of this deliverable is to provide a baseline for the exploitation management of AGILE. In this first iteration, the focus is on the innovation potential the individual project partners see for AGILE as an opportunity to explore alternative exploitation and monetization paths, or to enhance existing ones. In order to achieve a structured overview, a business model validation tool is introduced and applied to each participating partner in AGILE. The tool identifies each partners’ envisaged customer segments, their common need, the value promise of the solution, the technical aspects involved, the value network of stakeholders, the identifiable competition and the potential financial model. Each of these aspects is briefly explained with the goal of providing a starting point for later iterations of this deliverable.
This post lists and describes most of these demonstrations in order to share with you this excellent feedback.

The initial conclusions show that various partners in the project have compatible customer segments and value propositions that revolve around the AGILE solution. This compatibility is important, as it will allow individual partners to exploit results from the project in their respective businesses: it is clear that the integrated solution that AGILE promises to be will be exploitable as such, but at the same time it will allow several partners to build on and exploit the results even without a further commercialised, integrated platform.

Being a software company, one of the key challenges we face on a regular basis is on how to design and develop custom hardware components in order to either explore new services or accommodate specific customer needs. This typically involves specific hardware and IoT devices to be integrated. With the IoT ecosystem comprising many hundreds of new players offering one or two parts of the IoT puzzle, finding the right hardware + software solution is often a time-consuming task, especially for small companies like Thinkinside.
The Agile project allowed us to tackle one of the key pain points of ICT companies working in the IoT+retail sector, and in particular

. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.

New biosensors are released daily promising to help us monitor important biosignal parameters. Until recently, lower priority has been given to interoperability while emphasis has been put on data collection, many times on remote servers without the level of guarantees that the user’s data will not be misused. The AGILE software stack with the component-based architecture and open source licensing and development model allows for the implementation of a fully-fledged gateway under the user’s control.
The proliferation of a multitude of biosignal sensors and activity trackers to gather user biosignal and wellness attributes poses unique challenges for their effective integration into user-centric applications which will provide valuable insights and promote healthy behaviors. Such sensors include

Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.

In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.

D6.5 Innovation and Exploitation Planning and Report
The goal of this deliverable is to provide an additional layer for the exploitation management of AGILE and enable exploitation planning. In this second iteration, the focus is put on the exploitation opportunities for each pilot conducted within AGILE to explore avenues for monetization and go-to-market strategies. To build up on the Business Modelling assessment from the first iteration of this deliverable, a stakeholder-based business modelling approach was chosen to define the business model scenarios of the single pilots as archetypes for AGILE exploitation possibilities. The approach defines the stakeholder environment in which the AGILE-driven solutions of the pilots are integrated and then defines which stakeholders could provide revenue to make the solution sustainable and which users would have to cooperate in order for the pilot-specific business models to be sustainable a the targeted market.
The business model solutions were drafted collaboratively in a workshop on the consortium meeting in Q1 2017 and refined afterwards. The initial conclusions from the business modelling exercise and following research show that each pilot has solid exploitation options and a variety of stakeholder that are likely to provide a sustainable inflow of revenue. The diversity of the pilot business models shows how flexibly AGILE can be deployed, without being limited to a specific application or a specific domain.

In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.

Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.
We have used AGILE Node-RED for reading and collecting information from BLE and LoraWAN channels (sensors) and sending data via WiFi or NB-IoT to the external cloud services used by ISTMOS (based on FIWARE enablers).
The results of the ISTMOS-AGILE integration have been evaluated through a pilot case study in collaboration with two large Greek wineries.
Overall, AGILE offered a good approach for prototyping of devices. The interfaces to Cloud platforms are supportive, while remote fleet management is offering additional possibilities for the offer of custom services. AGILE is a big step in the right direction and has offered us valuable experiences and knowledge that will be further exploited.

In a world where we have instant access to information and where competition is just a click away, it has become crucial to attract customers and to keep them interested. If we put this scenario in the context of an economic crisis and where small retailers are directly competing with large shopping centers or hypermarkets, we can plainly see that it becomes increasingly difficult for the retailers. In this situation, information technology, IoT in particular, can help the sector improve and show what is has to offer. The key is to make the product or service more attractive to customers and differentiate it from the competitors. One approach it so highlight the quality and the possibilities for personalization, which are advantages smaller retailers have that run-of-the-mill superstores typically don’t.

The architecture of the AGILE Software stack allows for the integration of new sensors increasing the usefulness of the Agile Gateway in many applications. In order to ease access to sensors data the Agile –IoT project has defined a set of REST commands which homogenize access to sensors. Unfortunately, due to the great variance of features and access protocols between devices, great effort is needed to integrate them via the implementation of corresponding device drivers but the architecture of the AGILE software stack aims to ease these difficulties. AGILE offers two methods of device integration:

. Many types of goods can be easily damaged by improper variations in temperature while others can be severely affected by shocks or excessive duration of transport. The impact from unsuitable transport and storage for wine is far greater than the mere cost of damaged goods, as it also includes brand damage for companies such as wine producers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics companies. The size of the problem is very large as nearly 5% of bottled wine worldwide is damaged, up to 25% is negatively affected, and the uprise in quality problems due to improper storage settings , along with 20% of the quality wine consumed worldwide is counterfeit.

monitoring platform allows the supply chain stakeholders of bottled wine to monitor the most critical parameters affecting wine quality during its storage and transportation. Delivering traceability information down to the level of each individual bottle, the platform includes complex-event processing, rule and alert management and an analytics engine. We employ monitoring stations (fixed for storage and mobile for transportation) and collect and analyze the information on our own IoT platform which relies on FI-WARE enablers, particularly PERSEO complex event processing and ORION context broker.
Wineries and retailers already have various types of measurement instruments in place to control temperature and humidity in wine storage spaces. Soon, an increasing number of stakeholders in the wine supply chain will be equipped with a plethora of IoT devices from different hardware vendors to measure wine storage environments. These sensors will operate across a wide range of wireless communication protocols, notably BLE and LoRaWAN, where low-power consumption is important, but also WiFi or NB-IoT.

In this market, ISTMOS needs to offer an open architecture solution which doesn’t lock customers into using a restricted set of devices or protocols. The modular, multi-protocol gateway architecture proposed by AGILE represents a promising approach to address the interoperability challenge faced by ISTMOS.
Therefore, we have evaluated AGILE as an interoperability solution for ISTMOS gateways. We ported ISTMOS gateway controller logic to the AGILE architecture by developing the necessary containerized applications that interact with several components of the AGILE stack.

sector. The core objective has been the possibility to offer a tool to produce and purchase food on the market. Farmers are guided, from fields and environments, to follow precise procedures for the production of high quality products, tracing maturity stages. The Farmer Assistant App suggests appropriate treatments and operations that provide the growing of trees and fruits, accurate time to proceed with fruit harvesting and send climate condition notifications. With the enablement to produce more with less, farmers are becoming economically competitive by applying environmentally sustainable techniques.
Through Agile, Holonix has demonstrated how it is achievable to integrate different types of weather stations and new sensors to facilitate and acquire a wider variety of environmental data that influence the fruit treatment.
Our needs, vision, and mission are explained below:
NEEDS
A wider growing percentage of olive oil consumers is becoming extremely cautious and accurate in the selection of the products to consume as well as to high demand in terms of quality. Consumers, buying a food product, want to be assured that the products on their tables are with certified origins, produced accordingly to biological processes, and have a high regard for farmer labor conditions.

And if they are not extracting information from that data, why bother storing it in the first place?
Seconds can be the differentiator between fixed and broken, faulty -working, accident-good fortune , life or death.
Fog computing becomes the standard due to firstly having the need of information in real-time but simultaneously , the need of data to be correlated, something that is impossible, if our processing is centered in either our devices or our datacenter.
The Agile Gateway was incredible in assisting us to understand how we could bring this decentralized value to our business and platform which enabled us to offer a better service with better performance and responsiveness.

New biosensors are released daily promising to help us monitor important biosignal parameters. Until recently, lower priority has been given to interoperability while emphasis has been put on data collection, many times on remote servers without the level of guarantees that the user’s data will not be misused. The AGILE software stack with the component-based architecture and open source licensing and development model allows for the implementation of a fully-fledged gateway under the user’s control.

To start with, the vision of Jolocom aligns with the original idea of the World Wide Web, which was distributed: everyone would have their own node (e.g. home page), everyone would share their content (e.g. blog posts), and everyone would own their own data. The web consisted of nodes connected through links with no center. Jolocom wants to help reclaiming this vision that everyone owns their own node (digital identity) and that every node can communicate with any other node, with no intermediation (e.g. centralized platform).

FlairBit business offerings.
To conclude, the open source software Agile-IoT consortium is developing with a business-friendly license that allows FlairBit’s Senseioty IoT platforms to be Agile-IoT compliant, and at the same time to remain proprietary which allows FlairBit to increase its own product value and unlocking potential businesses in new markets. Simultaneously, FlairBit open sourced software components extend the Agile IoT stack and enables Big-Data Analytics on-top-of Agile IoT gateway, based on open source technologies (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Beam).

The architecture of the AGILE Software stack allows for the integration of new sensors increasing the usefulness of the Agile Gateway in many applications. In order to ease access to sensors data the Agile –IoT project has defined a set of REST commands which homogenize access to sensors. Unfortunately, due to the great variance of features and access protocols between devices, great effort is needed to integrate them via the implementation of corresponding device drivers but the architecture of the AGILE software stack aims to ease these difficulties. AGILE offers two methods of device integration:

(Decentralized Applications) through Access Control Lists (ACLs) and if you’ve given access permission to the requester of the data, the Solid server delivers it.
Here’s a concrete example.You might store data from your IoT devices or sensors in your own PDS: the sort of data about yourself that would normally be uploaded directly from your IoT device to a third party. That way if someone built a new DApp, to offer specialized services to people, you could join it by using your WebID. To share information with others (individuals or organisations), you simply give them permission to access the appropriate information in your PDS. The data in your PDS would remain your own, in every sense of the word: fully under your control, stored where you choose, and usable only by an Organization’s WebID that you’ve given permission to.

In this case, data is sent to the gateway in real-time or stored continuously on the device until connectivity to the gateway is possible. Wearables (activity trackers and smartwatches) as well as sensors that monitor continuously various biosignals belong to this category.
The Quantified Self Application
The Quantified Self application uses the AGILE software stack to access data from the supported sensors. The application allows the user to monitor his activity against predefined goals. Sensor-based and cloud-sourced data can be used to quantify the progress.

What the research community and industry are agreeing on is that IoT systems currently lack blockchain building frameworks which consider specific requirements of a typical IoT system including: a large number of microtransactions, unfeasible proof of work validation, real-time validation, avoiding large transaction fees, IoT specific smart contracts, high node churn in case of hosting ledger on end-user personal devices. To address these challenges, VizLore built the IoT blockchain framework (based on Hyperledger Fabric) which enables federation of blockchains across multiple IoT systems and platforms. In order to properly validate the federation potential, we required collaboration with an IoT platform provider who offers open software stack that is capable of hosting our software agents and focusing on the edge and fog components of IoT systems. The AGILE IoT fulfilled both requirements. IoT gateway software architecture is very similar to that of our IoT controllers and cloud platform. AGILE IoT focuses on building new IoT systems with specific configuration and deployment of IoT gateways. This proved to be an ideal blockchain federation enabler since each new gateway instance (on both AGILE and VizLore Labs end) introduces a new node into the federated blockchain architecture and enhances its distribution span and robustness. The AGILE IoT project pilots require innovative privacy management approaches which do not limit the business potential based on data sharing. The VizLore extension project also focused on producing a set of smart contract templates, specifically tailored for IoT business cases that are automatically stored on the federated blockchain. Therefore, the integration potential was very high and this remained true during the execution of the extension project.

Governments are slowly adapting to this, with the upcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation as the first move towards a market in which businesses will have to adapt with new business models and technical infrastructure. With the decentralized web as an answer to these needs, users will be able to use services they want to interact with, data will be stored in their own private location, and they will be able to switch between them. This will allow and encourage for a market with a significantly lowered barrier to innovate, one in which collaboration between players is much favourable over competition. Without the main competitive advantage of data, network effects and vendor lock-in will become virtually obsolete. We help businesses create and participate in collaborative decentralized ecosystems where the value generated by its services benefits the ecosystem as a whole.

During execution of the extension project and porting of the VizLore federated blockchain enablers onto the AGILE SW stack, we have worked most of the AGILE SW components and services (GW SE stack, ramp-up configurator, Node-RED, recommender system). The documentation and examples are excellent and allowed fast validation and prototyping. Together with the AGILE team, we have identified the need for supporting 64-bit OS architectures on AGILE GWs in order to enable full integration of the Hyperledger Fabric components. Integration with the ramp-up configurator and Node-RED environment helped us to validate the role of our Hyperledger Fabric components in fast IoT system prototyping framework. We have identified and addressed all the requirements that our solution needs to fulfill in order to be an integral part of the AGILE fast IoT prototyping framework, thus bringing the blockchain technology closer to the IoT system integrators.
Achieved results and impact
We promote our solution as blockchain as a service (BaaS). Consequently, , “collective IoT” security and privacy management as a service is offered to IoT platform operators and system integrators. The VizLore IoT blockchain fabric can be deployed on IoT platforms (as part of VizLore IoT edge devices or hosted on 3rd party edge devices and servers) regardless whether or not their services actively use the blockchain applications. The VizLore federated Hyperledger fabric for IoT systems is actively being exploited as an integral part of the VizLore’s business strategy and IoT service offerings. Our Smart Access Control IoT service is enhanced with the Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts so that each virtual key is a smart contract stored on the federated blockchain fabric. This significantly enhances security and robustness, while providing solid ground for establishing innovative business models for entrance vouchers and remote access control.

The architecture of the system is the combination of AGILE gateway and
S&C’s enControl IoT platform
and smart home solution. At the AGILE gateway, we have developed a protocol for a commercial movement detector device (PIR), that one may capture movement events detected to fit the activity model. The protocol has been encapsulated within a dedicated docker container, allowing any other AGILE component to work with the PIR sensor. The protocol pushes PIR events to enControl IoT platform,where the activity model has been developed and deployed. Results from the model evaluation against PIR events are broadcasted using messages in a pub/sub architecture within enControl. This pub/sub connectivity is used to connect this output back to AGILE (GW) by a developed microservice, so it can be exploited by other AGILE components. The microservice is also a docker container, and it opens a persistent connection to enControl by using lightweight web sockets technology allowing real-time server push updates.

enControl is constantly monitoring devices data received from the gateway and, for example, when an anomaly is detected, it’s pushed immediately to the HAWK notifier microservice who then proceeds to parse the data and store it in a local database.

through joint blockchain fabric based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric framework. The result is the first federated IoT blockchain established between two IoT platforms covering various IoT verticals. This integration enhances the AGILE IoT platform with robust blockchain enabled security and privacy policy enforcement framework while simultaneously broadening and enhancing the potential of the VizLore federated IoT blockchain solution.
Motivation behind the extension project
What the research community and industry are agreeing on is that IoT systems currently lack blockchain building frameworks which consider specific requirements of a typical IoT system including: a large number of microtransactions, unfeasible proof of work validation, real-time validation, avoiding large transaction fees, IoT specific smart contracts, high node churn in case of hosting ledger on end-user personal devices. To address these challenges, VizLore built the IoT blockchain framework (based on Hyperledger Fabric) which enables federation of blockchains across multiple IoT systems and platforms. In order to properly validate the federation potential, we required collaboration with an IoT platform provider who offers open software stack that is capable of hosting our software agents and focusing on the edge and fog components of IoT systems. The AGILE IoT fulfilled both requirements. IoT gateway software architecture is very similar to that of our IoT controllers and cloud platform. AGILE IoT focuses on building new IoT systems with specific configuration and deployment of IoT gateways. This proved to be an ideal blockchain federation enabler since each new gateway instance (on both AGILE and VizLore Labs end) introduces a new node into the federated blockchain architecture and enhances its distribution span and robustness. The AGILE IoT project pilots require innovative privacy management approaches which do not limit the business potential based on data sharing. The VizLore extension project also focused on producing a set of smart contract templates, specifically tailored for IoT business cases that are automatically stored on the federated blockchain. Therefore, the integration potential was very high and this remained true during the execution of the extension project.

S&C’s enControl IoT platform
and smart home solution. At the AGILE gateway, we have developed a protocol for a commercial movement detector device (PIR), that one may capture movement events detected to fit the activity model. The protocol has been encapsulated within a dedicated docker container, allowing any other AGILE component to work with the PIR sensor. The protocol pushes PIR events to enControl IoT platform,where the activity model has been developed and deployed. Results from the model evaluation against PIR events are broadcasted using messages in a pub/sub architecture within enControl. This pub/sub connectivity is used to connect this output back to AGILE (GW) by a developed microservice, so it can be exploited by other AGILE components. The microservice is also a docker container, and it opens a persistent connection to enControl by using lightweight web sockets technology allowing real-time server push updates.

This integration allows
Senseioty
to benefit in flexibility both in terms of data ingestion and edge computing capabilities. Moreover, the Agile Gateway modularity at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired IoT networking technologies and Senseioty benefits from these additional protocols as a way to create new data sources and IoT connectors.
On the other hand, Senseioty offers a usable
Distributed Data Stream Processor
(DDSP), leveraging artificial intelligence to anticipate problems, detect unexpected event patterns and to optimize processes, services and decisions. This component has been integrated with the Agile IoT gateway enabling new innovative services at edge level and making such services available in the Agile IoT market place and ecosystem through Senseioty.

An Overview of Research on Computational Resource Management in AGILE
Posted on
7th November 2018
21st November 2018
We would like to take this opportunity to illustrate the challenges related to computational resource consumption such as memory, CPU or networking, in our gateway setup. First and foremost, we must admit the utmost importance of ensuring that services provided by the gateway have reasonable use of the computational resources. This is how we can ensure that there is space available for applications using core services from AGILE. However, this is not the only reason to keep an eye on resource consumption. There are also security implications and economic reasons to monitor and control the use of resources, i.e. especially when computation should be offloaded to the cloud.

We will discuss the release of an open-source component to measure resource consumption in the gateway plus other scenarios. We will then explain how we have used this component in the scope of the project to perform several research tasks. Applications of the resource measurement component have been used to study resource abuse scenarios from the perspective of security, detection of crypto-miners, and evaluation of strategies to balance the computation load between the gateway and the cloud.

Yeon Sue Park is an anthropologist-artist based between Barcelona and Seoul. Exploration of the crossroads between anthropology and art is the first question of her artwork. Anthropological findings and insights bring to create a narrative, and languages and practices of art join it to represent the story. She uses installation, image, performance and writing in her work in order to investigate new forms of visual research and representation.
Souneil Park is a research scientist at Telefonica Research, working in the area of data mining, human-computer interaction, and information visualization. He was involved in a variety of projects, such as data driven analysis of driving behavior for intelligent car safety features, development of an interactive visual tool for analysing the diffusion of rumors and debunks in social media, design of an online news framework for exposing readers to diverse political perspectives.
Our collaborative work aims to communicate with a larger public, beyond artist groups or academia using a coherent and experimental language of expression.About the project:
About the project:
“Still touchable?” explores our relationships to information. The physical relationships we had with the media, such as letters, postcards, newspapers, CD, which started to disappear as the touch, feel, memories and emotions we had with them are disappearing. Instead, we CLICK. The omnipresence of screens where we click on has not helped us yet figure out the type of substance it has, the data. Are they material or immaterial? Do they truly exist? If so, where and how? Encountering this paradox of existence, we invite people to reflect on our physical relationship to the information: Who replaced our bookstores, record shop and post offices? And how? Can we recuperate our physical relationships with the information nowadays? Can they still be tangible and interactable? The public will ponder these questions in a space where our daily performance of producing and receiving information takes a physical form, and recall the interaction experiences of the past and contrast them.

IVI installation is a prototype of architectural experimental design and fabrication. It is the end-result of the architectural programme that was organized in Chania, Greece, by the Architectural Association, school of architecture in London, in October 2016. The intense programme focused its scientific approach in making use of advanced methodologies for architectural design, interactive spatial systems and digital methods for fabrication through a series of parametric morphologies and manipulation of space. Within a period of 10 days the design team researched, tested and realized the prototype.
Various cultural and environmental elements have been embedded within the design to promote a series of current issues of the contemporary way of thought. The fabrication of the prototype has been realized via a participatory process with a serial of comparative approach methods and multiple alternative experimentations that enabled a family of in-between sketches, drawings and models. The final prototype is made of 45 square meters of kite fabric held together by 400 meters of fiber. It is a light-weight structure, the form of which has been designed through the use of various computer software such as Autodesk Maya, Rhinoceros 5 and Grasshopper. The form is defined by two pumps that inflate it with air. The prototype’s interior is accessible and is where the users experience a series of projection simulations. These digital optical projections derive from the investigation of Chania’s urban fabric and aim to encourage relations of interaction and participation by the visitors, with the use of an AGILE powered Raspberry Pi microcontroller which allows for interaction via smart phone devices that change the projection on the specific mapped area.
AA Greece Programme Head: Alexandros Kallegias. AA VS Director: Christopher Pierce. Tutoring Team: Alexandros Kallegias, Yue Shi ,Pierre Bianchi. Interaction Collaborator: Charalampos Doukas. Fabrication Collaborator: Rallou Nikolaidou Participants: Konstantina Kousari, Evangelia Apostolaki, Paraskevi Malea, Maria Antoniou, Marianna Bagordaki, Styliani Michael, Joanne Spyridi, Kohei Morishita, Ioannis Mitsis, Georgios Sketopoulos, Spyridon Nikolopoulos, Georgios Vlasios Pakalidis, Zhuxi Zeng, Nikoletta Karastathi.

About the project:
The Fountains installation draws on open data sets of water pollution selected from specific locations around the globe to create data visualizations that transform the 3D scanned, virtual skin surfaces of people’s bodies to reflect the quality of their local water sources. The installation features audio recordings of interviews of people adversely affected by water pollution, as well as people living with fair water conditions. The audio of each person’s interview will match up with their corresponding virtual bodies as their skin textures transform.

The virtual bodies take form as sculptural video projections, rotating from one virtual body to the next in harmony with the changing water sources. Real-time turbidity data readings from the Great Lakes region in the US are fed to the AGILE gateway and provide an ever changing sound score.

About the project:
Floral Automaton is a sculptural device that grows flowers digitally. Using various sensors taken from Smart Cities technologies, it reacts and adapts itself to its environment in real time. Sensors are instruments that translate chemical or mechanical stimuli such as light, temperature, gas concentration, speed and vibration across analog and digital sensors into electrical resistors and voltage signal. Using the information collected by several sensors, Floral Automaton interprets our physical ‘decor’ to generate a computational environment. Enclosed within a 2.5 by 2.2 meters frame of steel, various electronic components are attached to a 2.3mm galvanized wire rope. Each of those components is programmed to preserve a balanced meteorological condition in order to display ‘4K time-lapse videos’ of blooming flowers.The information collected by the device becomes a material to mimic biological processes and question the authenticity of our surroundings. Floral Automaton explores the implications when environments become programmable and are made to be operational through sensor technologies.

Artists: Luisa Fabrizi (IT), Andre Landwehr (DE)
AGILE support partner: BioAssist
About the artist:
Luisa Fabrizi is an architect, interaction designer and artist based in Hamburg. Her artistic research is a constant speculation on the use of body data as a mean to reflect on human emotion and as an instrument of artistic self-expression. Her works are an effort of bridging between digital and analog, machines and humans, through a constant reflection on the use of space, new technologies and theorizations. She graduated as an architect in Rome (Italy) and as an interaction designer in Malmö (Sweden). Nowadays she is one of the artists in the Honigfabrik ateliers in Hamburg-Wilhemsburg and works as an exhibition designer for a German design office.

AGILE IoT Open Call #2 – AGILE IoT Community website
A picture taken with a camera lets us see the world through a photographer’s eyes. But the options of representing the personal involvement with the photograph are restricted by the technical settings of a camera. The sensory extensions of the “E-Camera” allow the artist to add a further much more intimate and immediate component to her work enriching it with her emotions in the moment the picture’s taken.

“E-Camera” is communicating with biometric sensors that are attached to the photographer’s body. These sensors measure the photographer’s heart rate, body-temperature and galvanic value when taking a picture. All of these data strongly reflect the photographer’s emotions. Whenever the photographer takes a picture a software analyses the photographer’s momentary body data and remixes the picture in a way that resembles the original picture. Based on the body data the picture is enriched, almost distorted, by an evocative interpretation of the photographer’s emotional state.The use of “E-Camera” enables the photographer to reflect on her emotions and to actively embody them into the creative process of photography.

The use of “E-Camera” enables the photographer to reflect on her emotions and to actively embody them into the creative process of photography. In this way, the project “E-Camera” aspires to become a new way to consider photography and to reveal a new approach to the Quantified Self field. After the Adaptation exhibition, the project will be further developed to give more photographers the opportunity to explore the “E-Camera” for their artwork.

AGILE builds a modular and adaptive gateway for IoT devices. Modularity at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired IoT networking technologies (e.g. KNX, ZWave, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, etc.) and allows fast prototyping of IoT solutions for various domains (e.g. home automation, environment monitoring, wearables, etc.). At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally. The AGILE software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps are recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.

WP1 - Gateway HW Design & Implementation
1.1
AGILE will run five pilots by QuantifiedSelf from wearables for self-tracking, and open air crop and livestock monitoring using drones, to smart retail solutions for enhanced shopping experiences. These pilots will both demonstrate the applicability of the hardware and software in managing IoT devices and creating applications and sharing data, and will set the foundations for further commercial exploitation of the Project and innovations.
An IoT Testbed
AGILE will become part of the existing IoT-Lab infrastructure in France managed by INRIA. With more than 2500 sensors deployed in 5 locations, AGILE users will have the opportunity to evaluate their IoT applications in real environments, collect and store sensor data, and interact with real devices.

There are two files used by the agile-security docker container taking care of identity management, policy administration, and policy decision points. The two files are located in the DATA folder under security/agile-idm-core-conf.js and security/agile-ui-conf.js.
In order to get a full reimbursement of your costs, you will need to provide a quarterly overview of expenses in relation to your budget. Expenses not related to the Agile IOT budget will not be allowed. The documentation has to clearly list the delivered features in relation to your proposal, the annex to the contract. The product needs to be delivered in a way, that the Agile IOT project is able to test the developed features. If there is a need to present your source code for review the Agile IOT project will not disclose any intellectual property as far as required by your organisation.

. This is useful for applications that want to implement their own interfaces (graphical or not) on their own and interact with the AGILE API directly. However, there is also a possibility to embed a Web application directly in AGILE OSJS and leverage that AGILE OSJS has already authenticated the user.
For this there is a sample AGILE OSJS application that passes the authentication token to the backend of your application here:

OAuth2 configurations and WebSecurity
Aspects related to authentication providers and Web Security is located on the agile-ui-conf file. To configure CORS domains to generate requests from the browser, enhance the list located under "cors" in the configuration file. This allows browser-side AJAX requests to agile-security from particular domains.
Only costs generated during the lifetime of the project can be eligible. Generally, costs must be actually incurred (actual costs). That means that they must be real and not estimated, budgeted or imputed.
Costs must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting and management principles and practices of the beneficiary. The accounting procedures used in the recording of costs and receipts shall respect the accounting rules of the State in which the beneficiary is established. The beneficiary’s internal accounting and auditing procedures must permit direct reconciliation of the costs and receipts declared in respect of the project with the corresponding financial documents.

Since the security component behaves as an OAuth2 server towards applications using AGILE, it needs to recognize which applications a which users are interacting with the gateway. What makes this hard is that agile-security needes to know the "public" hostname of the gateway to configure these properties. To this end we have enabled a keyword to use a hostname provided by the AGILE_HOST environment variable or by the /etc/hostname file from the host where the agile-security docker image is running (if the hostname file is mounted in the docker-compose file).
The keyword used to specify the security component to take the AGILE_HOST or the /etc/hostname information (with precedence as they have been mentioned) is

A subcontractor (i.e. a third party which has entered into an agreement on business conditions with your organisation) is not considered eligible for realising your planned core work. Since a subcontractor that would carry out part of the work of the project would work without the direct supervision of your organisation and without a relationship of subordination, subcontracting can only be allowed for non-core task (e.g. creating a poster, events, communications) and which are of small amounts.
However, a small travel budget and dissemination material in order to present your project in the AGILE IOT events and Agile IOT project related activities would be eligible.

What are the maximum reimbursement rates of eligible costs?
When planning your project and the related development efforts for realising the app, you can calculate with 100% reimbursement of person efforts (i.e. developer related actual salary plus employers share). On top of the personnel costs you can add 7% of overhead that would also be reimbursed.

Do I need to calculate travel costs and dissemination events?
Yes. Generally, a small budget for travel and dissemination materials shall be taken into account for being able to present your results in AGILE IOT related activities. In accordance with your proposed project, you could also plan for required travels as well as for the dissemination and preparation of app exploitation after your project ends. Moreover, we will also invite selected app developers to larger events for being able to disseminate to a large target audience.

Introduction
You will have to deliver your project as to your product plan. It is not possible to extend your project in time.
If you are not able to deliver in scope and time as to your project plan, you will get the possibility to justify the non-accomplishment in an Executive Project Management Board hearing. If its outcome is negative, you will no longer be eligible neither for further funding nor for participating to Agile IOT open calls and activities.
Can I ask for more information?

D2.1 will deliver the analysis result performed in T2.1 and T2.2. It will contain the main requirements for the AGILE software modules (Ubuntu OS modules and services running on top) and also the description of mechanisms developed/integrated that will enable the automatic configuration of the gateway based on the hardware modules attached every time. In addition, it will present all the IoT protocols and mechanisms that will provide device discovery and M2M interoperability to AGILE, for being integrated into the software components.
D2.2 Initial version of Gateway Self-configuration, IoT Device discovery & Remote gateway management [M09]

On month 9 the initial software modules of AGILE framework is delivered as initial versions for evaluation by pilot stakeholders. Community evaluation will have been already performed by the developer’s community (engaged through the dissemination activities in WP7) through the incremental alpha releases of the software in the open source repositories. All modules and application graphical interfaces (gateway, data, device management and developer’s interface) will be delivered as open source modules.

. This technology consists of a number of capabilities that have been added to the Linux operating system kernel over the last few years, and allow for virtualization without computational overhead. This means that entire virtual machines can be run on a resource-limited device, such as a thermostat or medical device, allowing for easy updates without restarting the device, or risking damage to the ability for further remote operation in case of a faulty update. Linux Containers have become increasingly popular as a virtualization technique in data centers, with the arrival of the

The Docker toolkit however did not support CPUs with the ARM architecture which dominates small and embedded devices. Resin.io’s team made that breakthrough in November 2013 and was recognised by all related parties. We soon followed this breakthrough by achieving cross- compilation of containers on x86 servers, offering the speed and power of a data center, instead of using the slower ARM devices for the compilation step which can take hours depending on the payload. In January we released the first prototype of resin.io, our end-to-end service, which for the first time supports ‘git push’ deployment for embedded devices. This mechanism, invented by Linus Torvalds, author of the Linux OS, is now widespread for deployment to cloud services, but had never been used for embedded devices. We proceeded to adapt the

The company’s involvement will be in achieving both the initial design of the gateway software, e.g. for low-cost embedded devices, and also delivering the software stack and interface (UI and underlying components) for the management of devices and data from devices, as well as a streamlined Web-like development environment. Exploratory components include rule-based definition of notifications and actions, support for arbitrary devices as well as third-party extensions. Both research and development resource will be allocated to AGILE, for the duration of the project.
