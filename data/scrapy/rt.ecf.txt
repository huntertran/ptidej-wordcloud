Project:
Eclipse Communication Framework
Release:
3.10.0
Description:
ECF
release 3.10.0 (Mars) is the first release of Tooling for
Remote Services
. Here is a screenshot of the new Remote Services perspective
3.9.0 Release Review | projects.eclipse.org
Additional screenshots may be found on the
New and Noteworthy
API Certification:
The project leadership certifies that the APIs in this release are "Eclipse Quality".
Architectural Issues:
In keeping with all previous releases, the architectural quality of this release is high. We still implement the OSGi Remote Service and Remote Service Admin v1.1 specifications, and continue to test against and pass the OSGi RSA CT suite.
Security Issues:
No known vulnerabilities.
Non-Code Aspects:
Many tutorials and examples
have been recently added
.
Usability Details:
The newly introduced Remote Service Tooling follows all guidelines and conventions closely. All strings have been externalized to support internationalization. No devitions from the UI guidelines and standards are known to exist.
End of Life:
None.
Standards:
ECF's implementation implements the R6 version of the OSGi Remote Services and Remote Service Admin specification from the enterprise spec. Project lead Scott Lewis participates as an invited researcher on the OSGi Enterprise Experts Group.

Release:
3.9.0
Description:
Add support for OSGi R6 Remote Service Admin 1.1 (chapter 122) specification. The RSA 1.1 specification added support for updating/modifying remote service properties, and this new API in the OSGi classes (in org.osgi.service.remoteserviceadmin.* package), requires adding API in ECF's implementation. New/additional API implies a minor release for ECF, since ECF follows the OSGi Semantic versioning recommendations and the PDE API Tools-enforced versioning policies.

ECF's 3.8.0 release will focus on implementing the lastest OSGi specification for Remote Services (chapter 100 in OSGi Enterprise Specification) and Remote Service Admin (chapter 122 in OSGi Enterprise Specification).
