Keti is a service that was designed to protect RESTfuls API using Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).
The solution itself is implemented as a cloud-native RESTful API that adheres to the guiding principles of the
twelve factor app
. Key characteristics of the service include:
Central management of policies and privileges
The ability to manage hierarchical privileges (e.g. sub-groups) and scoped privileges (e.g. assigning elevated privileges based on the resource accessed)
A policy format tailored for developers who build RESTful APIs
An access control decision engine
Spring Boot
is the primary framework that Keti is built on. Additionally Keti uses the following open source libraries:
JanusGraph
, an implementation of
Apache TinkerPop
, for it's graph data structure
Jedis
as a
Redis
client for caching
Spring Security
to protect it's API
Spring Data JPA
for persistence to RDBMS
An operator deploys Keti in the same datacenter where the web services it protects are deployed. Either a common gateway, or the web service itself, sends requests for authorized access to Keti and enforces the decision received in the response. When deployed, Keti typically has the following service dependencies.
UAA
as an OAuth server
Redis
(optional) for decision caching
Cassandra
through JanusGraph for graph persistence
PostgreSQL
, or
H2
as a RDBMS
Below is a basic diagram of how Keti fits in the interaction between web application and web service.

Keti - Access Control Service
Note: Keti was earlier called ACS. This repository still has references to artifacts with that name and can be treated as synonymous to Keti.
License
This project is licensed under Apache v2.
How to build and run unit tests
To build Keti without support for hierarchical attributes and run unit tests:
Specify the
public-graph
profile to build Keti with support for hierarchical attributes.
Start Keti locally
To run the service locally without support for hierarchical attributes:
To run the service locally with support for hierarchical attributes:
The Keti service requires a UAA (User Account and Authentication:
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa
) service to manage OAuth clients and users that are authorized to access it. When running Keti locally, by default the service is configured to trust the local UAA. You can modify the environment variable
ACS_DEFAULT_ISSUER_ID
and
UAA_CHECK_HEALTH_URL
to correspond to your existing UAA.
Running UAA locally
Clone the UAA repository from the following url:
How to run integration tests
The script below starts UAA and Keti, runs the tests, then stops the Keti and UAA services:
Specify the
-g
option to run integration tests against Keti that supports hierarchical attributes.

To run the service locally with support for hierarchical attributes:
The Keti service requires a UAA (User Account and Authentication:
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa
) service to manage OAuth clients and users that are authorized to access it. When running Keti locally, by default the service is configured to trust the local UAA. You can modify the environment variable
ACS_DEFAULT_ISSUER_ID
and
UAA_CHECK_HEALTH_URL
to correspond to your existing UAA.
Running UAA locally
Clone the UAA repository from the following url:
How to run integration tests
The script below starts UAA and Keti, runs the tests, then stops the Keti and UAA services:
Specify the
-g
option to run integration tests against Keti that supports hierarchical attributes.

Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
Use cases in the industrial internet often have requirements for access control that are not satisfied by standards that are prevalent in the consumer space. For example, standards like OAuth 2.0 model privileges as flat lists of coarse-grained scopes that are granted for the entire user login session. Newer standards like UMA allow for finer-grained access control but do so in ways that require more client-side complexity. Additionally, Neither of these standards define a common way to write policies or manage privileges.
Meanwhile, in the enterprise space, the XACML standard has slowly gained traction. While XACML is a comprehensive standard, our experience has proved that it is costly to implement and comes with a steep learning curve. Thus, we decided to build a service that offered a simplified and comprehensive Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) for RESTful APIs.
Scope:
The Eclipse Keti project provides an access control service that protects RESTful APIs from unauthorized access.
Description:
Keti is a service that was designed to protect RESTfuls API using Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).
The solution itself is implemented as a cloud-native RESTful API that adheres to the guiding principles of the
twelve factor app
. Key characteristics of the service include:
Central management of policies and privileges
The ability to manage hierarchical privileges (e.g. sub-groups) and scoped privileges (e.g. assigning elevated privileges based on the resource accessed)
A policy format tailored for developers who build RESTful APIs
An access control decision engine

Creation Review | projects.eclipse.org
Julien Vermillard is a Mentor for Eclipse Keti | projects.eclipse.org
is the primary framework that Keti is built on. Additionally Keti uses the following open source libraries:
Titan DB
, an implementation of
Apache TinkerPop
, for it's graph data structure
Jedis
as a
Redis
client for caching
Spring Security
to protect it's API
Spring Data JPA
for persistence to RDBMS
An operator deploys Keti in the same datacenter where the web services it protects are deployed. Either a common gateway, or the web service itself, sends requests for authorized access to Keti and enforces the decision received in the response. When deployed, Keti typically has the following service dependencies.
UAA
as an OAuth server
Redis

Below is a basic diagram of how Keti fits in the interaction between web application and web service.
Why Here?:
The context of this work and the resources that it will protect are related to IOT use cases. Eclipse has a nexus of IOT related projects, and companies that support them, and the Keti project fits well together with them.

Hi,
Looks great! Just a question: why limit it to IoT and not put it in "runtime" ? Because after taking a look at the code the scope looks broader than connected objects (a bit like jetty, which is a runtime project).

I agree with Julien, this seems to have a much broader applicability than
just
IoT :-)
