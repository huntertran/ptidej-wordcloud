The Eclipse Thingweb project will start with three sub-projects in the toolkit:
Thingweb node-wot
node-wot is the official reference implementation of the W3C WoT Working Group and implements the so-called "Servient Architecture":
node-wot provides a
WoT Thing Description
parser and serializer, several "Protocol Binding" implementing the
WoT Binding Templates
, as well as a runtime system ("WoT Runtime") providing the
WoT Scripting API
for applications. It is based on Node.js and its fundamental module structure.
Thingweb Directory
A Thing Directory is a directory service for WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs) that provides a Web interface to register TDs (aligned with
draft-ietf-core-resource-directory
) and look them up (e.g., using SPARQL queries or CoRE Link Format). The Thingweb Directory implements this service using the
Apache Jena
triple store and SPARQL endpoint.
Thingweb WebUI
Thingweb also intends to provide tooling around the Web of Things ecosystem. The
WebUI
is an
AngularJS
browser app to visualize TDs and enable the interaction with Things from the Web browser.

Scope:
The Eclipse Thingweb project is intended as
open-source toolkit for the Web of Things ecosystem
with modular implementations of the technological building blocks standardized by the W3C. The toolkit may include implementations of the same building block for different platforms, frameworks, or languages. The initial building blocks currently being standardized are:
Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description
Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates
Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API
Once these documents reach Candidate Recommendation status, the W3C WoT activity intends to re-charter the WoT Working Group to standardize the next set of building blocks. This is being explored and identified by the WoT Interest Group, which operates in parallel to the Working Group. Thingweb intends to grow with new building blocks being defined in the future. This may include early work by the WoT Interest Group that is not part of the standards track yet.
Furthermore, Thingweb shall include auxiliary tools for the WoT ecosystem such as user interfaces or visualizers for Things, converters to the Thing Description and its serializations, semantic processors around the Thing Description, etc.
