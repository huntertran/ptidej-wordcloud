The Eclipse Agail is a language-agnostic, modular software and hardware gateway framework for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT application execution, trusted data sharing and external Cloud communication.
A framework both for developers who wish to quickly prototype IoT solutions but also for end users who want to easily customise their gateway based on their context and have full control of their data and devices.
The hardware framework defines the design of a RaspberryPi shield that comes with various onboard sensors and two Xbee sockets for hosting different wireless communication modules (e.g., ZigBee, LoRaWAN, ZWave, etc.)
The following image visualises the AGAIL software structure:
The Agail software consists of serveral modules that can operate indepdently from each other and implement various features including IoT device discovery and management, data storage & management, IoT workflow development, remote gateway management, communication with external Cloud services and more.
Modularity & Adaptability
At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally.
At the deployment level, the software components packaging & delivery is performed through containerization. This choice gives the developers the flexibility to share and install components without worrying about dependencies and conflicts. The containers utilise the internal AGAIL Project API, so access to gateway resources can be monitored and fully controlled by the user.
The following detailed view illustrates the concept of the containers and the language-agnostic Agail Gateway API for inter-module communication:
The Agail software can auto-configure and adapt the essential components, based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps and workflows can be recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.

Scope:
The goals of the Eclipse Agail project can be summarised as follows:
Provide a design and hardware specifications for a modular RaspberryPi hat (shield) that hosts various sensors and provides Xbee sockets for hosting wireless communication modules;
Provide a modular architecture for implementing IoT Gateways through building blocks that feature communication with IoT devices, data collection, local storage and processing, with focus on data ownership and device interoperability;
Provide IoT application developers with the Agail API, a generic API offering services for device discovery, communication, data management (local and cloud storage), data processing and remote gateway management, accessible as a RESTful interface;
Provide a language-agnostic framework based on containers to implement IoT Gateway services around Agail API (based on DBus), allowing to reuse and integration of existing best-in-class IoT open source packages for device communication using standard IoT protocols (BLE, ZigBee, LoRa, TCP/IP, etc.), user interfaces for device and data management;
Provide gateway management components (for managing connected IoT devices and enabled IoT/M2M protocols, installed applications and components, resource management, etc.);
Deliver reference implementations of the building blocks in a containerized form to simplify deployment and delivery of services and applications on the gateway that implement the core features of the Agail : communication with commercial wireless and wired IoT devices, protocol support (Thread, IoTivity, etc.), local data management and visualization, local and remote gateway management, application workflow design and execution, data exchange and application deployment on external clouds.

Project:
Eclipse Agail
Proposal:
Eclipse Agail
Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
Currently the majority of IoT solutions involve the communication of devices with some cloud service for data management and application execution. In many cases a gateway is involved for providing Internet connectivity to non-IP wireless or wired networks, but mainly it forwards data to the Internet.
The Eclipse Agail framework comes from the collective work of an existing community, in the context of a european H2020 funded IoT project (
AG
AIL). More than 16 entities (research, industrial, startups and nonprofits) in Europe have come together to build and deliver a fully open source modular gateway framework.
Scope:
The goals of the Eclipse Agail project can be summarised as follows:
Provide a modular architecture for implementing IoT Gateways through building blocks that feature communication with IoT devices, data collection, local storage and processing, with focus on data ownership and device interoperability;

We believe that the Eclipse Community will appreciate and embrace the modular concept of containers for building a full IoT gateway stack. We need the support of the Community for helping us test, extend and adopt the Agail framework. The purpose of the Agail project is to extend current Eclipse IoT projects and provide an integrated framework for IoT gateways that offers device management, data storage and handling and language-agnostic application development.
The Agail already has a strong relationship with other Eclipse projects:
Eclipse Paho will be used as an internal broker for extending the Agail RESTful API and allowing developers to communicate with the Agail gateway components using the MQTT protocol for data interaction between applicatons and connected IoT devices and the internal data storage.
Eclipse Vorto will be used as a standardised way for describing the available IoT devices and most importantly enable vendors and developers to easily integrate device support in the future.
Eclipse Smart Home will be investigated for potentially integrating communication with the numerous existing IoT devices the framework already supports.
Agail originates from the H2020 funded
AG
AIL project.
Initial Contribution:
The initial contribution of the Eclipse Agail project will be a large subset of the current code on H2020 AGAIL project GitHub:
https://github.com/Agile-IoT
Which will contain:
Source code for all mentioned interfaces and services of the gateway
Source code of many building blocks for the web-based graphical management interfaces
Documentation of the architecture and its extension points

Examples on how to build applications on top of AGAIL framework and documentation
Legal Issues:
The AGAIL project team will go through the Eclipse legal review process to make sure all Eclipse AGAIL dependencies are eligible for contribution. While AGAIL has selected open-source components with friendly licenses, a detailed review will be conducted with the Eclipse legal team.
Currently the code developed and used/integrated on project's
GitHub
is released under APv2. The software components that will be exclusively developed by the project will be contributed to the Eclipse AGAIL under the Eclipse Public Licence. Reference implementations that include third party open source software (e.g.,
Node-RED
) will retain the original licence and will be published on the original GitHub account.

Recommender and Configurator Docker Service
Maintainer: Seda Polat Erdeniz, TUGraz
This service provides an API to other AGILE Gateway services to access to the recommender and configurator service
API Document
http://54.202.180.98:8080/doc/
Recommender Use Cases
Use Case 1 : App Recommendation
Use Case 2 : Workflow/Node Recommendation
Use Case 3 : Device Recommendation
Use Case 4 : PaaS Provider (Cloud) Recommendation
Configurator Use Cases
Use Case 1 : App Configuration
Goal: Update the configuration of each app on the gateway based on utility maximization for each
Apps support different Data encoding and Connectivity protocols,
Eclipse IoT
Background:
Currently the majority of IoT solutions involve the communication of devices with some cloud service for data management and application execution. In many cases a gateway is involved for providing Internet connectivity to non-IP wireless or wired networks, but mainly it forwards data to the Internet.
The Eclipse Agail framework comes from the collective work of an existing community, in the context of a european H2020 funded IoT project (
AG
AIL). More than 16 entities (research, industrial, startups and nonprofits) in Europe have come together to build and deliver a fully open source modular gateway framework.
Scope:
The goals of the Eclipse Agail project can be summarised as follows:
Provide a modular architecture for implementing IoT Gateways through building blocks that feature communication with IoT devices, data collection, local storage and processing, with focus on data ownership and device interoperability;
Provide IoT application developers with the Agail API, a generic API offering services for device discovery, communication, data management (local and cloud storage), data processing and remote gateway management, accessible as a RESTful interface;
Provide a language-agnostic framework based on containers to implement IoT Gateway services around Agail API (based on DBus), allowing to reuse and integration of existing best-in-class IoT open source packages for device communication using standard IoT protocols (BLE, ZigBee, LoRa, TCP/IP, etc.), user interfaces for device and data management;
Provide gateway management components (for managing connected IoT devices and enabled IoT/M2M protocols, installed applications and components, resource management, etc.);
Deliver reference implementations of the building blocks in a containerized form to simplify deployment and delivery of services and applications on the gateway that implement the core features of the Agail : communication with commercial wireless and wired IoT devices, protocol support (Thread, IoTivity, etc.), local data management and visualization, local and remote gateway management, application workflow design and execution, data exchange and application deployment on external clouds.

Gateway support different Data encoding and Connectivity protocols,
App should be configured to a protocol that is also supported by the gateway
Each protocol has 3 dimensions : performance, reliability and cost,
Cost should be minimized where other dimensions should be maximized in total,
User weights are taken in inputs for each dimension (weight of cost should be given as negative value),
App should be configured to a protocol that has maximum utility based on user weights and the performance/reliability/cost values of the protocols
Configurator returns the configured protocols for each app,
If protocols of app are not supported by the gateway, configured protocol of the app is set to -1 and in the error message it is given as a warning.

The Eclipse Agail is a language-agnostic, modular software gateway framework for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT apps execution, and external Cloud communication.
A framework both for developers who wish to quickly prototype IoT solutions but also for end users who want to easily customise their gateway based on their context and have full control of their data and devices.
The following image visualises the AGAIL structure:
Modularity & Adaptability
At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally.
At the deployment level, the software components packaging & delivery is performed through containerization. This choice gives the developers the flexibility to share and install components without worrying about dependencies and conflicts. The containers utilise the internal AGAIL Project API, so access to gateway resources can be monitored and fully controlled by the user.
The following Development view illustrates the concept of the containers and the language-agnostic Gateway API for inter-module communication:
The Agail software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps and workflows can be recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.
Why Here?:
We believe that the Eclipse Community will appreciate and embrace the modular concept of containers for building a full IoT gateway stack. We need the support of the Community for helping us test, extend and adopt the Agail framework. The purpose of the Agail project is to extend current Eclipse IoT projects and provide an integrated framework for IoT gateways that offers device management, data storage and handling and language-agnostic application development.
The Agail already has a strong relationship with other Eclipse projects:
Eclipse Paho will be used as an internal broker for extending the Agail RESTful API and allowing developers to communicate with the Agail gateway components using the MQTT protocol for data interaction between applicatons and connected IoT devices and the internal data storage.
Eclipse Vorto will be used as a standardised way for describing the available IoT devices and most importantly enable vendors and developers to easily integrate device support in the future.
Eclipse Smart Home will be investigated for potentially integrating communication with the numerous existing IoT devices the framework already supports.
Agail originates from the H2020 funded

- Developer graphical Interface
Status: Ongoing
Future steps:
- Integration of Eclipse Vort for the definition and creation of abstract IoT device bindings
- Integration of Eclipse Paho for the extention of the internal Agail RESTful API and support of MQTT as alternative messaging and data subscription mechanism
First build for testing: Expected in 1st quarter of 2017
First version delivered: Expected in 2nd quarter of 2017
Future Work:
Within the next year we plan to develope and deliver many reference implementations for the support of various IoT standards (e.g., Thread, IoTivity, etc.) and specific support for commercial IoT devices. In addition, the reference implementation of Agail will be used in the context of the AGAIL project for evaluation in real life use cases (e.g., in wearables and outdoor air quality monitoring scenarios and surveliance using drones) while European startups and SMEs will be invited to utilise and contribute to the Agail framework with reference implementations and extentions.

DBus interface path
/org/eclipse/agail/DeviceFactory
The DeviceFactory can also load device implementation from a plugin folder. This plugin folder should be part of the classpath and also specified as the first parameter to the DeviceFactory. Class files with device implementation must implement the org.eclipse.egail.Device interface, and should be placed directly in the org.eclipse.agail.device.instance package. Class files must be placed in the plugin folder structured in a folder hierarchy corresponding to the package, i.e. the usual Java way: /org/eclipse/agail/device/instance/MyNewAgileDevice.class.
HTTP API
The DBus API can be used from the HTTP endpoint exposed by default on port
8080
.
See the
HTTP API reference
for details on the exposed endpoints.
To query the endpoint, we suggest using
Postman
by importing the swagger based
API definition

AGILE-CLI: command line interface
This repository contains the AGILE command line interface, a small tool to simplify deployment, development, and maintenance of the AGILE stack from the command line.
AGILE-CLI is a thin layer on top of agile-stack, simplifying some of the most common operations. For more advanced usage, agile-stack can also be used directly using docker and docker-compose commands.
AGILE-CLI supports two different workflows:
direct deployment on the AGILE Gateway
managing the AGILE Gateway remotely
#Prerequisites
A platform for the Agile GW: Currently supported platforms are:
RaspberryPi 2/3 running ResinOS
RaspberryPi 2/3 running Raspbian with Docker installed
Generic x86_64 running Linux of MacOS with Docker installed
If used in remotely managed mode, a platform to run the CLI with Docker, Docker-compose and bash installed.

directory you can find different scripts to setup and start / stop the modules.
./scripts/start.sh
will install (if not available) all the dependencies required to run and start the modules.
To control which component to start:
./scripts/start.sh ProtocolManager
starts only the Protocol Manager module
./scripts/start.sh DeviceManager
starts only the Device Manager module
./scripts/start.sh http
starts only the HTTP API module
./scripts/stop.sh
will kill all the modules.
To control which component to stop (based on
pkill -f
pattern):
./scripts/stop.sh protocolmanager
stop only the Protocol Manager module
The CLI works on top of agile-stack, therefore both repos are required:
By default AGILE-CLI reads its configuration from
agile.config
, defining the path to agile-stack, the operation mode, and eventually the IP address of the AGILE GW. Configuration examples are available in
agile.config.examples/
.
For simplicity, the tool can self-install the
agile
command in the path with
initializing the GW
First of all, if not yet done, the GW should be initialized with
./agile init
Usage
Use
./agile start
to start the main components, and
./agile stop

Update
Use
./agile update

git pull
, which updates the startup scripts only.
Updating a single component
In most cases, you can update a single coponent while other components keep running. For example, to update agile-osjs without restarting the rest, use the following commands:
