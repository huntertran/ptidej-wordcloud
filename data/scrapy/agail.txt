The Eclipse Agail is a language-agnostic, modular software and hardware gateway framework for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT application execution, trusted data sharing and external Cloud communication.
A framework both for developers who wish to quickly prototype IoT solutions but also for end users who want to easily customise their gateway based on their context and have full control of their data and devices.
The hardware framework defines the design of a RaspberryPi shield that comes with various onboard sensors and two Xbee sockets for hosting different wireless communication modules (e.g., ZigBee, LoRaWAN, ZWave, etc.)
The following image visualises the AGAIL software structure:
The Agail software consists of serveral modules that can operate indepdently from each other and implement various features including IoT device discovery and management, data storage & management, IoT workflow development, remote gateway management, communication with external Cloud services and more.
Modularity & Adaptability
At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally.
At the deployment level, the software components packaging & delivery is performed through containerization. This choice gives the developers the flexibility to share and install components without worrying about dependencies and conflicts. The containers utilise the internal AGAIL Project API, so access to gateway resources can be monitored and fully controlled by the user.
The following detailed view illustrates the concept of the containers and the language-agnostic Agail Gateway API for inter-module communication:
The Agail software can auto-configure and adapt the essential components, based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps and workflows can be recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.

Scope: The goals of the Eclipse Agail project can be summarised as follows:
Provide a design and hardware specifications for a modular RaspberryPi hat (shield) that hosts various sensors and provides Xbee sockets for hosting wireless communication modules;
Provide a modular architecture for implementing IoT Gateways through building blocks that feature communication with IoT devices, data collection, local storage and processing, with focus on data ownership and device interoperability;
Provide IoT application developers with the Agail API, a generic API offering services for device discovery, communication, data management (local and cloud storage), data processing and remote gateway management, accessible as a RESTful interface;
Provide a language-agnostic framework based on containers to implement IoT Gateway services around Agail API (based on DBus), allowing to reuse and integration of existing best-in-class IoT open source packages for device communication using standard IoT protocols (BLE, ZigBee, LoRa, TCP/IP, etc.), user interfaces for device and data management;
Provide gateway management components (for managing connected IoT devices and enabled IoT/M2M protocols, installed applications and components, resource management, etc.);
Deliver reference implementations of the building blocks in a containerized form to simplify deployment and delivery of services and applications on the gateway that implement the core features of the Agail : communication with commercial wireless and wired IoT devices, protocol support (Thread, IoTivity, etc.), local data management and visualization, local and remote gateway management, application workflow design and execution, data exchange and application deployment on external clouds.

Eclipse Agail Creation Review
Type: CreationState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, November 2, 2016Project: Eclipse AgailProposal:
Eclipse Agail
Parent Project: Eclipse IoTBackground: Currently the majority of IoT solutions involve the communication of devices with some cloud service for data management and application execution. In many cases a gateway is involved for providing Internet connectivity to non-IP wireless or wired networks, but mainly it forwards data to the Internet.
The Eclipse Agail framework comes from the collective work of an existing community, in the context of a european H2020 funded IoT project (AGAIL). More than 16 entities (research, industrial, startups and nonprofits) in Europe have come together to build and deliver a fully open source modular gateway framework.
Scope: The goals of the Eclipse Agail project can be summarised as follows:
Provide a modular architecture for implementing IoT Gateways through building blocks that feature communication with IoT devices, data collection, local storage and processing, with focus on data ownership and device interoperability;

Description: The Eclipse Agail is a language-agnostic, modular software gateway framework for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT apps execution, and external Cloud communication.
A framework both for developers who wish to quickly prototype IoT solutions but also for end users who want to easily customise their gateway based on their context and have full control of their data and devices.

At the software level, different components enable new features: data collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device management, visual workflow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding, and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally.
At the deployment level, the software components packaging & delivery is performed through containerization. This choice gives the developers the flexibility to share and install components without worrying about dependencies and conflicts. The containers utilise the internal AGAIL Project API, so access to gateway resources can be monitored and fully controlled by the user.
The following Development view illustrates the concept of the containers and the language-agnostic Gateway API for inter-module communication:
The Agail software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps and workflows can be recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.
Why Here?: We believe that the Eclipse Community will appreciate and embrace the modular concept of containers for building a full IoT gateway stack. We need the support of the Community for helping us test, extend and adopt the Agail framework. The purpose of the Agail project is to extend current Eclipse IoT projects and provide an integrated framework for IoT gateways that offers device management, data storage and handling and language-agnostic application development.
The Agail already has a strong relationship with other Eclipse projects:
Eclipse Paho will be used as an internal broker for extending the Agail RESTful API and allowing developers to communicate with the Agail gateway components using the MQTT protocol for data interaction between applicatons and connected IoT devices and the internal data storage.
Eclipse Vorto will be used as a standardised way for describing the available IoT devices and most importantly enable vendors and developers to easily integrate device support in the future.
Eclipse Smart Home will be investigated for potentially integrating communication with the numerous existing IoT devices the framework already supports.
Agail originates from the H2020 funded AGAIL project.

Initial Contribution: The initial contribution of the Eclipse Agail project will be a large subset of the current code on H2020 AGAIL project GitHub:
https://github.com/Agile-IoT
Which will contain:
Source code for all mentioned interfaces and services of the gateway
Source code of many building blocks for the web-based graphical management interfaces
Documentation of the architecture and its extension points
Build scripts, pre-packaged modules and sample files
Examples on how to build applications on top of AGAIL framework and documentation
Legal Issues: The AGAIL project team will go through the Eclipse legal review process to make sure all Eclipse AGAIL dependencies are eligible for contribution. While AGAIL has selected open-source components with friendly licenses, a detailed review will be conducted with the Eclipse legal team.
Currently the code developed and used/integrated on project's GitHub is released under APv2. The software components that will be exclusively developed by the project will be contributed to the Eclipse AGAIL under the Eclipse Public Licence. Reference implementations that include third party open source software (e.g., Node-RED) will retain the original licence and will be published on the original GitHub account.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 1.0Project Scheduling: Project roadmap:
- Architecture definition
Status: Completed
- Initial implementation of wireless protocols support
Status: BLE, ZigBee completed. Upcoming: ZWave, LoRa
- User Interfaces (Data management, Device & Protocol management, etc.)
Status: Ongoing
- Developer graphical Interface
Status: Ongoing
Future steps:
- Integration of Eclipse Vort for the definition and creation of abstract IoT device bindings
- Integration of Eclipse Paho for the extention of the internal Agail RESTful API and support of MQTT as alternative messaging and data subscription mechanism

The Agail software can auto-configure and adapt based on the hardware configuration so that driver installation and configuration is performed automatically. IoT apps and workflows can be recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the gateway setup and development time significantly.
Why Here?: We believe that the Eclipse Community will appreciate and embrace the modular concept of containers for building a full IoT gateway stack. We need the support of the Community for helping us test, extend and adopt the Agail framework. The purpose of the Agail project is to extend current Eclipse IoT projects and provide an integrated framework for IoT gateways that offers device management, data storage and handling and language-agnostic application development.
The Agail already has a strong relationship with other Eclipse projects:
Eclipse Paho will be used as an internal broker for extending the Agail RESTful API and allowing developers to communicate with the Agail gateway components using the MQTT protocol for data interaction between applicatons and connected IoT devices and the internal data storage.
Eclipse Vorto will be used as a standardised way for describing the available IoT devices and most importantly enable vendors and developers to easily integrate device support in the future.

First build for testing: Expected in 1st quarter of 2017
First version delivered: Expected in 2nd quarter of 2017
Future Work: Within the next year we plan to develope and deliver many reference implementations for the support of various IoT standards (e.g., Thread, IoTivity, etc.) and specific support for commercial IoT devices. In addition, the reference implementation of Agail will be used in the context of the AGAIL project for evaluation in real life use cases (e.g., in wearables and outdoor air quality monitoring scenarios and surveliance using drones) while European startups and SMEs will be invited to utilise and contribute to the Agail framework with reference implementations and extentions.

Eclipse Smart Home will be investigated for potentially integrating communication with the numerous existing IoT devices the framework already supports.
Agail originates from the H2020 funded AGAIL project.
Licenses: Eclipse Public License 1.0Legal Issues: The AGAIL project team will go through the Eclipse legal review process to make sure all Eclipse AGAIL dependencies are eligible for contribution. While AGAIL has selected open-source components with friendly licenses, a detailed review will be conducted with the Eclipse legal team.
Currently the code developed and used/integrated on project's GitHub is released under APv2. The software components that will be exclusively developed by the project will be contributed to the Eclipse AGAIL under the Eclipse Public Licence. Reference implementations that include third party open source software (e.g., Node-RED) will retain the original licence and will be published on the original GitHub account.
Project Scheduling: Project roadmap:
- Architecture definition
Status: Completed
- Initial implementation of wireless protocols support
Status: BLE, ZigBee completed. Upcoming: ZWave, LoRa
- User Interfaces (Data management, Device & Protocol management, etc.)
Status: Ongoing
- Developer graphical Interface
Status: Ongoing
Future steps:
- Integration of Eclipse Vort for the definition and creation of abstract IoT device bindings
- Integration of Eclipse Paho for the extention of the internal Agail RESTful API and support of MQTT as alternative messaging and data subscription mechanism
First build for testing: Expected in 1st quarter of 2017
First version delivered: Expected in 2nd quarter of 2017
Future Work: Within the next year we plan to develope and deliver many reference implementations for the support of various IoT standards (e.g., Thread, IoTivity, etc.) and specific support for commercial IoT devices. In addition, the reference implementation of Agail will be used in the context of the AGAIL project for evaluation in real life use cases (e.g., in wearables and outdoor air quality monitoring scenarios and surveliance using drones) while European startups and SMEs will be invited to utilise and contribute to the Agail framework with reference implementations and extentions.

Agile data service
This service allows users to create workers called subscriptions that consume the agile API and write data to a timeseries database, it also allows users to query, create retention policies and directly write new measurements to the db.
API
Create subscription for device component
method: POST
url: /api/subscription
body: {
deviceID: 'mySensor',
componentID: 'temperature',

Each protocol has 3 dimensions : performance, reliability and cost,
Cost should be minimized where other dimensions should be maximized in total,
User weights are taken in inputs for each dimension (weight of cost should be given as negative value),
App should be configured to a protocol that has maximum utility based on user weights and the performance/reliability/cost values of the protocols
Configurator returns the configured protocols for each app,
If protocols of app are not supported by the gateway, configured protocol of the app is set to -1 and in the error message it is given as a warning.

This modules only responsibility is to init a dbus socket called agile_bus_socket in the host system with agile.conf.
How to use:
docker pull agileiot/agile-dbus-armv7l
Bind-mount the host directory the socket will be created and run:
docker run -v /my/host/fs/.agile_bus
or with docker-compose:
agile-dbus:
image: agileiot/agile-dbus-armv7l
restart: always
volumes:
- $DBUS_SESSION_SOCKET_DIR:/usr/src/app/.agile_bus

AGILE-CLI is a thin layer on top of agile-stack, simplifying some of the most common operations. For more advanced usage, agile-stack can also be used directly using docker and docker-compose commands.
AGILE-CLI supports two different workflows:
direct deployment on the AGILE Gateway
managing the AGILE Gateway remotely
#Prerequisites
A platform for the Agile GW: Currently supported platforms are:
RaspberryPi 2/3 running ResinOS
RaspberryPi 2/3 running Raspbian with Docker installed
Generic x86_64 running Linux of MacOS with Docker installed
If used in remotely managed mode, a platform to run the CLI with Docker, Docker-compose and bash installed.
Installation
The CLI works on top of agile-stack, therefore both repos are required:
git clone https://github.com/Agile-IoT/agile-cli.git
git clone https://github.com/Agile-IoT/agile-stack.git
By default AGILE-CLI reads its configuration from agile.config, defining the path to agile-stack, the operation mode, and eventually the IP address of the AGILE GW. Configuration examples are available in agile.config.examples/.
cd agile-cli
cp agile.config.examples/agile.config.resinOS agile.config
For simplicity, the tool can self-install the agile command in the path with
sudo ./agile install
initializing the GW
First of all, if not yet done, the GW should be initialized with ./agile init
Usage
Use ./agile start to start the main components, and ./agile stop to stop them.
Once components started you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or http://resin.local:8000 or http://agilegw.local:8000, depending on the use case) to access the AGILE user interface and start building your IoT solution.

AGILE API specification documents
Welcome to the AGILE API specifications!
To read the API spec see this page
NOTE: This document is a work in progess that will be properly reviewed and finalized soon
In this repository we are going to define and version the internal API exposed by AGILE core modules via DBus IPC.
Contributing
Create an issue to suggest a modification or propose a change by creating a pull request.
Contributors shall follow those guidelines in order to get their contribution accepted.
##Specification
The model should be a valid YAML document
All method and property names are CamelCased, more precisely PascalCased
All top level definitions may have a group text or text list to aggregate different object in categories. A tags list is used to aggregate different object on various topics.
Methods must indicate a return type, with void if no return is expected and optionally a list of arguments
Methods arguments must be a map with name as key and at least the type field specified as value
Methods arguments and properties may have a default value to indicate a predefined value if non is specified.
Asynchronous Methods must indicate a reference field indicating one or more Properties that receive updates from the call
Properties referencing one object must have a reference field. If it is a list there will be a type Array with the reference field.
Properties can indicate an access field as list of one of read, write, subscribe
Optionally a description can be provided on methods, arguments and properties
Every object can expose an http field containing compliant Swagger 2.0 routes specifications
###Object description example
org.eclipse.agail.ObjectName:

Connect BLE Device(TI SensorTag): The ConnectDevice.java file in org.eclipse.agail.devicemanager.example package demonstrates the usage of Agile org.eclipse.agail.Device Dbus interface to connect a TI SensorTag device.
Read Data: The ReadData.java file in org.eclipse.agail.devicemanager.example package demonstrates the usage of org.eclipse.agail.Device DBus interface in order to read temperature data from TI SensorTag temperature sensor/service.
AGILE Device Factory
Exposes the org.eclipse.agail.DeviceFactory interface
DBus interface name org.eclipse.agail.DeviceFactory
DBus interface path /org/eclipse/agail/DeviceFactory
The DeviceFactory can also load device implementation from a plugin folder. This plugin folder should be part of the classpath and also specified as the first parameter to the DeviceFactory.
Class files with device implementation must implement the org.eclipse.egail.Device interface, and should be placed directly in the org.eclipse.agail.device.instance package. Class files must be placed in the plugin folder structured in a folder hierarchy corresponding to the package, i.e. the usual Java way: /org/eclipse/agail/device/instance/MyNewAgileDevice.class.
HTTP API
The DBus API can be used from the HTTP endpoint exposed by default on port 8080.
See the HTTP API reference for details on the exposed endpoints.
To query the endpoint, we suggest using Postman by importing the swagger based API definition
Launching the API
Under the scripts directory you can find different scripts to setup and start / stop the modules.
./scripts/start.sh will install (if not available) all the dependencies required to run and start the modules.
To control which component to start:
./scripts/start.sh ProtocolManager starts only the Protocol Manager module
./scripts/start.sh DeviceManager starts only the Device Manager module
./scripts/start.sh http starts only the HTTP API module
./scripts/stop.sh will kill all the modules.

Update
Use ./agile update to download the newest version of AGILE component. Note that this is different from git pull, which updates the startup scripts only.
Updating a single component
In most cases, you can update a single coponent while other components keep running.
For example, to update agile-osjs without restarting the rest, use the following commands:
./agile compose stop agile-osjs
./agile compose pull agile-osjs
./agile compose up agile-osjs
Troubleshooting
You can access the logs with ./agile compose logs and view all logs.
To view per component log use ./agile compose logs <component>
To get the list of running components use ./agile compose ps with the pattern compose_<component name>_1

Types:
@NOTE: Subtypes should be added accordingly and mapped to DBus supported types
In case an Object or Array is specified a fields field should be added to describe the content.
Use an * to indicate a complex variable (like Object and Array) has non specified return type, eg. Object*
Enum should be defined in the same document of the object using it, eventually with an unique name inside the whole specs
Enum should be defined as autonomous types with a field enum and a list of fields with keys
void indicates a null value
Primitive types:
Number: eg. 1, 5.9, -0.1
String: eg. "Anything in double quotes :)"
Boolean: eg. true or false
Structured types:
