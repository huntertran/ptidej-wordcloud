Protocols
Ponte allows you to publish and receive the data using any protocol: HTTP, MQTT and CoAP.
You can mix and match: submit with CoAP and subscribe via MQTT.
Thanks to MQTT subscribes and CoAP observe, your devices can get updated in real-time.
Thanks to MQTT-over-Websockets, your users can too!

Data Formats
Ponte aims to convert multiple data formats, you will be able to publish your data in JSON,
MsgPack, Byson, BSON and XML. Need another one? Use HTTP accept queries to get another version.
We are building it..
Security and Privacy
Ponte will help you, the developer, in building a user-driven security solution to support the communication between all these devices.
Thanks to Ponte, there will be no need to prepare a custom authentication for your things, and another for your users.
We are building it..
Architecture
The diagram on the right shows Ponte's architecture.
Ponte bridges three different application protocols:
HTTP, MQTT and CoAP.
The Internet of Things is about real-world events,
so Ponte is based on some of most powerful
publish/subscribe brokers:
RabbitMQ and all implementations of
the AMQP protocol.
Redis, the fabulous key/value store by
@antirez.
Mosquitto and all implementations of the
MQTT protocol.
MongoDB, the documental NoSQL that
is revolutioning how web apps are built.
The Web is about accessing syndicated data: after a payload
is published, it must be retained for supporting standard
HTTP/REST access.
Ponte supports MongoDB,
Redis, and
LevelDB as
storage engines.
HTTP API
HTTP is an implementation of the REST pattern, where a resource can be
manipulated using standard verbs: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.
This allows to syndicate the things resources in a very straighforward way over a
database, by indexing their URIs.
Each thing is available at: http://<your ponte>/resources/<your thing>
MQTT API
MQTT
is an implementation of the publish/subscribe pattern.
Ponte is based on
Mosca
which implements most of the MQTT 3.1 spec.
In order to syndicate a value for HTTP access, publish
with the 'retain' flag.
Subscribe to your things to receive live updates.
Each thing is available at: mqtt://<your ponte>/<your thing>
CoAP API
CoAP
is an implementation of the REST pattern on the UDP protocol,
where a resource can be manipulated using standard verbs: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.
This allows to syndicate the things resources in a very straighforward way over a
database, by indexing their URIs.
Ponte fully supports the observe
spec, to receive live updates from you things.
Each thing is available at: coap://<your ponte>/r/<your thing>
Install
The current implementation of Ponte is built on top of
the Node.js
framework that provides a fast event-loop.
As an Eclipse project, we aim to have multiple implemantions of the same
concepts, and the node.js implementation is the first.
After installing node.js v0.10, just install the latest version from
NPM:
$ npm install ponte -g
$ ponte

Ponte
Ponte is a multi-transport Internet of Things / Machine to Machine broker.
As the current state it supports MQTT and REST
APIs over HTTP and CoAP.
Ponte is under active development, but it should work :).
If you plan to use Ponte in production
let us know, we'll be more than
happy to help you getting started and solve any issue you'll find out.
A test instance of ponte is available at ponte.eclipse.org, on HTTP,
MQTT and CoAP standard ports.
Report bugs at the Eclipse
Bugzilla
and join the mailing list.
Installation
Ponte is a node.js application, so it needs node.js
to run. The currently recommended version is node 4.3.1, which is the Longtime Support Version. Ponte is tested against versions 0.12, 4.3.1 and 5. Attention: you should currently not use ponte with node 5.7
$ npm install ponte bunyan -g
$ ponte -v | bunyan
Then you can connect to it with your preferred MQTT,
CoAP or
HTTP client.
Command Line Options
$ ./bin/ponte --help
Usage: ponte [options]
Options:
-h, --help output usage information
-V, --version output the version number
-m, --mqtt-port <n> the mqtt port to listen to
-p, --http-port <n> the http port to listen to
-a, --coap-port <n> the coap port to listen to
--host <host> the host to listen to
--coap-host <host> the host to listen to for coap requests
--mqtt-host <host> the host to listen to for mqtt requests
--http-host <host> the host to listen to for http requests
-d, --db <path> the path were to store the database
-c, --config <c> the config file to use (override every other option)
-v, --verbose set the bunyan log to INFO
--very-verbose set the bunyan log to DEBUG
Usage Example
Start ponte:
$ ponte -v | bunyan
Publishing from HTTP to MQTT
Publish from HTTP:
$ curl -X PUT -d 'world' http://localhost:3000/resources/hello
The messages from HTTP are retained, which means that are sent to
every new subscriber.
Subscribe using mosquitto_sub (mosquitto):
$ mosquitto_sub -t "hello" -v
hello world
Publishing from MQTT to HTTP
In order to publish a message that can be read from HTTP,
a MQTT client needs to set the retain flag.
This is how it is done using mosquitto_pub:
$ mosquitto_pub -t hello-from-mqtt -m "world" -r
Reading the published value is an HTTP GET away:
$ curl http://localhost:3000/resources/hello-from-mqtt
world
Publishing from CoAP to MQTT
You can send CoAP messages from the command line using coap-cli
In the following example we do a CoAP PUT to a resource:
$ echo -n 'world' | coap put coap://localhost/r/hello
Subscribe using mosquitto_sub (mosquitto):
$ mosquitto_sub -t "hello" -v
hello world
Publishing MQTT to CoAP
In order to publish a message that can be read from CoAP,
a MQTT client needs to set the retain flag.
This is how it is done using mosquitto_pub:
$ mosquitto_pub -t hello-from-mqtt -m "world" -r
In order to receive the live updates with CoAP, we need to
use the observe switch:
$ coap -o coap://localhost/r/hello-from-mqtt
Embedding
Ponte can be run in embbedded mode, by listening to specific events:
var ponte = require("ponte");
var opts = {
logger: {
level: 'info'
},
http: {
port: 3000 // tcp
},
mqtt: {
port: 3001 // tcp
},
coap: {
port: 3000 // udp
},
persistence: {
type: 'level',
path: './db'
}
};
var server = ponte(opts);
console.log("Resource Updated", resource, buffer);
});
// Stop the server after 1 minute
console.log("server stopped");
});
}, 60 * 1000);
Configuration
Configuration with MongoDB
Ponte can be run on top of MongoDB with the following configuration:
module.exports = {
persistence: {
// same as http://mcollina.github.io/mosca/docs/lib/persistence/mongo.js.html
type: "mongo",
url: "mongodb://localhost:27017/ponte"
},
broker: {
// same as https://github.com/mcollina/ascoltatori#mongodb
type: "mongo",
url: "mongodb://localhost:27017/ponte"
},
logger: {
level: 30, // or 20 or 40
name: "MongoPonte"
}
};
Launch it with $ ponte -c config.js.
Configuration with Redis
Ponte can be run on top of Redis with the following configuration:
module.exports = {
persistence: {
// same as http://mcollina.github.io/mosca/docs/lib/persistence/redis.js.html
type: "redis",
host: "localhost"
},
broker: {
// same as https://github.com/mcollina/ascoltatori#redis
type: "redis",
host: "localhost"
},
logger: {
level: 20,
name: "Config Test Logger"
}
};
Launch it with $ ponte -c config.js.
Configuration with MQTT and Redis
Ponte can be run on top of MQTT broker while using Redis (or similarly MongoDB) with the following configuration:
module.exports = {
persistence: {
// same as http://mcollina.github.io/mosca/docs/lib/persistence/redis.js.html
type: "redis",
host: "localhost"
},
broker: {
// same as https://github.com/mcollina/ascoltatori#mqtt
type: "mqtt",
port: "2883",
host: "localhost"
},
logger: {
level: 20,
name: "Config Test Logger"
}
};
Configuration with authentication and authorization callbacks
module.exports = {
coap: {
/**
*/
// Examples:
// Error: callback(error);
// Not authenticated: callback(null, false);
},
/**
*/
// Examples:
// Error: callback(error);
// Authorized: callback(null, true);
// Not authorized: callback(null, false);
},
/**
*/
// Examples:
// Error: callback(error);
// Authorized: callback(null, true);
// Not authorized: callback(null, false);
}
},
http: {
/**
*/
// See coap.authenticate
},
/**
*/
// See coap.authorizeGet
},
/**
*/
// See coap.authorizePut
}
},
mqtt: {
/**
* @link https://github.com/mcollina/mosca/wiki/Authentication-&-Authorization
*/
// ...
},
// ...
},
// ...
}
}
}
Launch it with $ ponte -c config.js.
Pub/Sub Brokers
Ponte is based on
Ascoltatori, so it supports the same backends:
RabbitMQ and all implementations of
the AMQP protocol.
Redis, the fabulous key/value store by
@antirez.
Mosquitto and all implementations of the
MQTT protocol.
MongoDB, the documental NoSQL that
is revolutionizing how web apps are built.
ZeroMQ without a central broker, so
Ascoltatori can also be used in a P2P fashion.
Persistence
Ponte requires a persistent storage for HTTP syndication and MQTT
support.
At the current state, it uses Mosca
persistence layer.
Thus, it offers several persitence options:
Memory,
LevelUp,
Redis,
MongoDB
All of them can be configured from the configuration file, under the
persistence key. The only exception is LevelUp, which can be specified
by using the --db option from the command line.
To do
ponte - npm
These are the new features you should expect in the coming
months:
Add Web Hooks support.
Document configuration options.
Add WebSocket and Server-Sent Events support.
Add a Web App for reading and writing.
Standalone persistence layer.
Any help is very welcome, so feel free to submit a pull-request.

Background
The advent of the World Wide Web revolutionized the way we work, communicate, socialize,
and how business is done: the Internet has become one the most pervasive technology.
Recently, smartphones and mobile broadband enabled us to carry the Internet in our pocket,
seamlessy integrating it in our lives.
However, everyday objects remain disconnected from the virtual world, while the "Internet of Things" (IoT)
movement is exploring how to interconnect them.
This technology shift is supposed to be greater than the advent of mobile phones, and a 2020 scenario
where non-phone interconnected devices will be 10 times the phone devices (50 vs 5 billions) is foreseen.
Billions of interconnected devices is a challenge for the whole Internet and for the objects themselves,
and in order to operate at that scale several major issues should be resolved.

Publishing from MQTT to HTTP
In order to publish a message that can be read from HTTP,
a MQTT client needs to set the retain flag.
This is how it is done using mosquitto_pub:
$ mosquitto_pub -t hello-from-mqtt -m "world" -r
Reading the published value is an HTTP GET away:
$ curl http://localhost:3000/resources/hello-from-mqtt
world
Publishing from CoAP to MQTT
You can send CoAP messages from the command line using coap-cli
In the following example we do a CoAP PUT to a resource:
$ echo -n 'world' | coap put coap://localhost/r/hello
Subscribe using mosquitto_sub (mosquitto):
$ mosquitto_sub -t "hello" -v
hello world
Billions of interconnected devices is a challenge for software developers: every device must be able to
communicate to every other possible device. However, there is no lingua franca between all these devices.
The devices, often called Machines, can be divided into sensors and actuators.
Sensors reacts to events from the real world, while actuators reacts to events from the virtual one.
Thus, event processing is a core feature of every IoT project. Most event processing systems are built
around the popular publish/subscribe pattern. As of today, there exist several protocols for interconnecting machines,
and they all fall under the label Machine-To-Machine (M2M).
The requirements of machines and people are distinctly different, and it may be hard to define a protocol
and the associated best practices to statisfy both of them. However, we can address these compelling requirements
by bridging these protocols, and let developers access the M2M world from within their comfort zone.

Embrace multiple data formats, such as JSON, XML, Msgpack, Bysant and provide ways to automatically convert between them;
eventually, common representation of sensors and actuators data will be defined (or adopted from Paho).
Define and build a user-driven security solution to support the communication between all these devices.
Description
The following are the plan items for the Ponte project:
Build a reusable solution for bridging several M2M protocols to REST:
Formalize a REST API for reading, writing and accessing the history of sensors and actuators.
Expose the MQ Telemetry Transport, also hosted within Eclipse, through the REST API.
Expose the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which is being standardized by the IETF, through the REST API.
Define an internal API for adding new protocols easily, through plugins.
Define a a JSON-based support for message formats, and add converters between them.
The converters API should be exposed to Ponte through plugins.
Study an OAuth 2 solution that can be embedded inside the machines,
to allow the end user, and eventually the owner, to authorize or deny every access.
Why Eclipse?
In recent years, Eclipse has attracted several machine-to-machine projects, such as Paho, Koneki and Mihini. Thanks to all these contributions, the Eclipse Software Foundation has built an thriving community of M2M developers.

The initial contribution of Ponte is based upon QEST, which is developed as part of Matteo Collina's Ph.D. This project has the aim to build a platform to make the developing of new, M2M solution easy for web developers.
Initial Contribution
All the source code of QEST, an initial implementation for bridging REST and MQTT world, which is available at GitHub: http://github.com/mcollina/qest.
QEST is written in CoffeeScript, but it is in the process of migrating to plain Javascript.
Licenses
Ponte will be dual licensed under the Eclipse Public License (EPL) 1.0
and Eclipse Distribution License (EDL) 1.0.
Legal Issues
As QEST is built on top of Node.js, the framework dependency needs to be approved. Moreover, the permission of moving QEST to Eclipse will be needed by the University of Bologna.
Committers
The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:
Matteo Collina, University of Bologna
We welcome additional committers and contributions.

Ponte is a multi-transport Internet of Things / Machine to Machine broker.
As the current state it supports MQTT and REST
APIs over HTTP and CoAP.
Ponte is under active development, but it should work :).
If you plan to use Ponte in production
let us know, we'll be more than
happy to help you getting started and solve any issue you'll find out.
A test instance of ponte is available at ponte.eclipse.org, on HTTP,
MQTT and CoAP standard ports.
Report bugs at the Eclipse
Bugzilla
and join the mailing list.
Installation
Ponte is a node.js application, so it needs node.js
to run. The currently recommended version is node 4.3.1, which is the Longtime Support Version. Ponte is tested against versions 0.12, 4.3.1 and 5. Attention: you should currently not use ponte with node 5.7
$ npm install ponte bunyan -g

Hey @chombium and @mcollina - sorry it took so long. The pull request has been reviewed and approved by our IP Team.
@mcollina can you merge it and proceed with nominating Jovan as a committer on Ponte (see https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#elections-committer, it should take just a minute of your time :-))

The messages from HTTP are retained, which means that are sent to
every new subscriber.
Subscribe using mosquitto_sub (mosquitto):

It should be done

#34
Closed
a MQTT client needs to set the retain flag.
This is how it is done using mosquitto_pub:
$ mosquitto_pub -t hello-from-mqtt -m "world" -r
Reading the published value is an HTTP GET away:
$ curl http://localhost:3000/resources/hello-from-mqtt
world
Publishing from CoAP to MQTT
You can send CoAP messages from the command line using coap-cli
In the following example we do a CoAP PUT to a resource:
$ echo -n 'world' | coap put coap://localhost/r/hello
Subscribe using mosquitto_sub (mosquitto):
$ mosquitto_sub -t "hello" -v
hello world
Publishing MQTT to CoAP
In order to publish a message that can be read from CoAP,
a MQTT client needs to set the retain flag.

Hi @kartben,
now when the changes have been merged and the voting is finished. Should we do something more so that I can get the commit rights?
what does the following mean?
"The next step is for the project lead to return to the portal and fill in the
VCS package and employer information for Jovan Kostovski."
Should @mcollina do something more?
BTW. My employer has nothing to do with Ponte. I am contributing to Ponte in my free time.
Best Regards,
Jovan
$ mosquitto_pub -t hello-from-mqtt -m "world" -r
In order to receive the live updates with CoAP, we need to
use the observe switch:
$ coap -o coap://localhost/r/hello-from-mqtt
Embedding
Ponte can be run in embbedded mode, by listening to specific events:
var ponte = require("ponte");
var opts = {
logger: {
level: 'info'
},
http: {
port: 3000 // tcp
},
mqtt: {
port: 3001 // tcp
},

Pub/Sub Brokers
Ponte is based on
Ascoltatori, so it supports the same backends:
RabbitMQ and all implementations of
the AMQP protocol.
Redis, the fabulous key/value store by
@antirez.
Mosquitto and all implementations of the
MQTT protocol.
MongoDB, the documental NoSQL that
is revolutionizing how web apps are built.
ZeroMQ without a central broker, so
Ascoltatori can also be used in a P2P fashion.
Persistence
Ponte requires a persistent storage for HTTP syndication and MQTT
support.
At the current state, it uses Mosca
persistence layer.
Thus, it offers several persitence options:
Memory,
LevelUp,
Redis,
MongoDB
All of them can be configured from the configuration file, under the
persistence key. The only exception is LevelUp, which can be specified
by using the --db option from the command line.
To do
These are the new features you should expect in the coming
months:
[ ] Add Web Hooks support.
[ ] Document configuration options.
[ ] Add WebSocket and Server-Sent Events support.
[ ] Add a Web App for reading and writing.
[ ] Standalone persistence layer.
Any help is very welcome, so feel free to submit a pull-request.
Eclipse, QEST and Ponte
Ponte is a proposal at Eclipse, and this is a pure-JS rewrite of
QEST in Javascript and on top of
Mosca.

Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
in a future version unintentionally.
Please try not to mess with the Makefile and package.json. If you
want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is
fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around
it.
