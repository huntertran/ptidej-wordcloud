Protocols
Ponte allows you to publish and receive the data using any protocol: HTTP, MQTT and CoAP. You can mix and match: submit with CoAP and subscribe via MQTT. Thanks to MQTT subscribes and CoAP observe, your devices can get updated in real-time. Thanks to MQTT-over-Websockets, your users can too!
Learn more »
Data Formats
Ponte aims to convert multiple data formats, you will be able to publish your data in JSON, MsgPack, Byson, BSON and XML. Need another one? Use HTTP accept queries to get another version.
We are building it..
Security and Privacy
Ponte will help you, the developer, in building a user-driven security solution to support the communication between all these devices. Thanks to Ponte, there will be no need to prepare a custom authentication for your things, and another for your users.
We are building it..
Architecture
The diagram on the right shows Ponte's architecture. Ponte bridges three different application protocols: HTTP, MQTT and CoAP. The Internet of Things is about real-world events, so Ponte is based on some of most powerful publish/subscribe brokers:
RabbitMQ
and all implementations of the
AMQP
protocol.
Redis
, the fabulous key/value store by
@antirez
.
Mosquitto
and all implementations of the
MQTT
protocol.
MongoDB
, the documental NoSQL that is revolutioning how web apps are built.
The Web is about accessing syndicated data: after a payload is published, it must be retained for supporting standard HTTP/REST access. Ponte supports
MongoDB
,
Redis
, and
LevelDB
as storage engines.
HTTP API
HTTP is an implementation of the REST pattern, where a resource can be manipulated using standard verbs: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. This allows to syndicate the things resources in a very straighforward way over a database, by indexing their URIs.
Each thing is available at:
http://<your ponte>/resources/<your thing>
MQTT API
MQTT
is an implementation of the publish/subscribe pattern. Ponte is based on
Mosca
which implements most of the MQTT 3.1 spec. In order to syndicate a value for HTTP access, publish with the 'retain' flag. Subscribe to your things to receive live updates. Each thing is available at:
mqtt://<your ponte>/<your thing>
CoAP API
CoAP
is an implementation of the REST pattern on the UDP protocol, where a resource can be manipulated using standard verbs: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. This allows to syndicate the things resources in a very straighforward way over a database, by indexing their URIs. Ponte fully supports the
observe
spec, to receive live updates from you things. Each thing is available at:
coap://<your ponte>/r/<your thing>
Install
The current implementation of Ponte is built on top of the
Node.js
framework that provides a fast event-loop. As an Eclipse project, we aim to have multiple implemantions of the same concepts, and the node.js implementation is the first.
After installing node.js v0.10, just install the latest version from
NPM
:
$ npm install ponte -g $ ponte

README
for the full docs.

Ponte
is a multi-transport Internet of Things / Machine to Machine broker. As the current state it supports
MQTT
and REST APIs over HTTP and CoAP.
Ponte
is under active development, but it should work :). If you plan to use Ponte in production
let us know
, we'll be more than happy to help you getting started and solve any issue you'll find out.
A test instance of ponte is available at
ponte.eclipse.org
, on HTTP, MQTT and CoAP standard ports.

Ponte - M2M Bridge Framework for REST developers
Ponte - M2M Bridge Framework for REST developers
The Ponte project is a proposed open source project under the
Eclipse Technology Project
.
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse community. Please send all feedback to the
Eclipse Proposals
Forum.
Background
The advent of the World Wide Web revolutionized the way we work, communicate, socialize, and how business is done: the Internet has become one the most pervasive technology. Recently, smartphones and mobile broadband enabled us to carry the Internet in our pocket, seamlessy integrating it in our lives. However, everyday objects remain disconnected from the virtual world, while the "Internet of Things" (IoT) movement is exploring how to interconnect them. This technology shift is supposed to be greater than the advent of mobile phones, and a 2020 scenario where non-phone interconnected devices will be 10 times the phone devices (50 vs 5 billions) is foreseen.
Billions of interconnected devices is a challenge for the whole Internet and for the objects themselves, and in order to operate at that scale several major issues should be resolved. Billions of interconnected devices is a challenge for software developers: every device must be able to communicate to every other possible device. However, there is no lingua franca between all these devices. The devices, often called Machines, can be divided into sensors and actuators. Sensors reacts to events from the real world, while actuators reacts to events from the virtual one. Thus, event processing is a core feature of every IoT project. Most event processing systems are built around the popular publish/subscribe pattern. As of today, there exist several protocols for interconnecting machines, and they all fall under the label Machine-To-Machine (M2M). The requirements of machines and people are distinctly different, and it may be hard to define a protocol and the associated best practices to statisfy both of them. However, we can address these compelling requirements by bridging these protocols, and let developers access the M2M world from within their comfort zone.

Matteo Collina
Scope
The scope of the Ponte project is threefold:
Define a simple REST API to expose the machines needs through REST, exposing multiple protocols (MQTT, CoAP) through the same API.
Embrace multiple data formats, such as JSON, XML, Msgpack, Bysant and provide ways to automatically convert between them; eventually, common representation of sensors and actuators data will be defined (or adopted from Paho).
Define and build a user-driven security solution to support the communication between all these devices.

Description
The following are the plan items for the Ponte project:
Build a reusable solution for bridging several M2M protocols to REST:
Formalize a REST API for reading, writing and accessing the history of sensors and actuators.
Expose the MQ Telemetry Transport, also hosted within Eclipse, through the REST API.
Expose the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which is being standardized by the IETF, through the REST API.
Define an internal API for adding new protocols easily, through plugins.
Define a a JSON-based support for message formats, and add converters between them. The converters API should be exposed to Ponte through plugins.
Study an OAuth 2 solution that can be embedded inside the machines, to allow the end user, and eventually the owner, to authorize or deny every access.
Why Eclipse?
In recent years, Eclipse has attracted several machine-to-machine projects, such as Paho, Koneki and Mihini. Thanks to all these contributions, the Eclipse Software Foundation has built an thriving community of M2M developers. The initial contribution of Ponte is based upon QEST, which is developed as part of Matteo Collina's Ph.D. This project has the aim to build a platform to make the developing of new, M2M solution easy for web developers.
Initial Contribution
All the source code of QEST, an initial implementation for bridging REST and MQTT world, which is available at GitHub:
http://github.com/mcollina/qest
. QEST is written in CoffeeScript, but it is in the process of migrating to plain Javascript.

The Internet of Things Bridge for REST developers
Overview
Browse Files
Ponte
Ponte
is a multi-transport Internet of Things / Machine to Machine broker. As the current state it supports
MQTT
and REST APIs over HTTP and CoAP.
Ponte
is under active development, but it should work :). If you plan to use Ponte in production
let us know
, we'll be more than happy to help you getting started and solve any issue you'll find out.
A test instance of ponte is available at
ponte.eclipse.org
, on HTTP, MQTT and CoAP standard ports.
Report bugs at the
Eclipse Bugzilla
and join the
mailing list
.
Installation
Ponte is a node.js application, so it needs
node.js
to run. The currently recommended version is node 4.3.1, which is the Longtime Support Version. Ponte is tested against versions 0.12, 4.3.1 and 5.
Attention: you should currently not use ponte with node 5.7
Then you can connect to it with your preferred
MQTT
,
CoAP
or
HTTP
client.
Command Line Options
Usage Example
Start ponte:
Publishing from HTTP to MQTT
Publish from HTTP:
The messages from HTTP are
retained
, which means that are sent to every new subscriber.
Subscribe using
mosquitto_sub
(
mosquitto
):
Publishing from MQTT to HTTP
In order to publish a message that can be read from HTTP, a MQTT client needs to set the
retain
flag. This is how it is done using
mosquitto_pub
:
Reading the published value is an HTTP GET away:
Publishing from CoAP to MQTT
You can send CoAP messages from the command line using
coap-cli
In the following example we do a CoAP PUT to a resource:
Subscribe using
mosquitto_sub
(
mosquitto
):
Publishing MQTT to CoAP
In order to publish a message that can be read from CoAP, a MQTT client needs to set the
retain
flag. This is how it is done using
mosquitto_pub
:
In order to receive the live updates with CoAP, we need to use the observe switch:
Embedding
Ponte
can be run in embbedded mode, by listening to specific events:
Configuration
Configuration with MongoDB
Ponte
can be run on top of MongoDB with the following configuration:
Launch it with
$ ponte -c config.js
.
Configuration with Redis
Ponte
can be run on top of Redis with the following configuration:
Launch it with
$ ponte -c config.js
.
Configuration with MQTT and Redis
Ponte
can be run on top of MQTT broker while using Redis (or similarly MongoDB) with the following configuration:
Configuration with authentication and authorization callbacks
Launch it with
$ ponte -c config.js
.
Pub/Sub Brokers
Ponte
is based on
Ascoltatori
, so it supports the same backends:
RabbitMQ
and all implementations of the
AMQP
protocol.
Redis
, the fabulous key/value store by
@antirez
.
Mosquitto
and all implementations of the
MQTT
protocol.
MongoDB
, the documental NoSQL that is revolutionizing how web apps are built.
ZeroMQ
without a central broker, so Ascoltatori can also be used in a P2P fashion.
Persistence
Ponte
requires a persistent storage for HTTP syndication and MQTT support. At the current state, it uses
Mosca
persistence layer. Thus, it offers several persitence options:
Memory
,
LevelUp
,
Redis
,
MongoDB
All of them can be configured from the configuration file, under the
persistence
key. The only exception is LevelUp, which can be specified by using the
--db
option from the command line.
To do
These are the new features you should expect in the coming months:
[ ] Add Web Hooks support.
[ ] Document configuration options.
[ ] Add WebSocket and Server-Sent Events support.
[ ] Add a Web App for reading and writing.
[ ] Standalone persistence layer.
Any help is very welcome, so feel free to submit a pull-request.
Eclipse, QEST and Ponte
Ponte is a proposal at Eclipse, and this is a pure-JS rewrite of
QEST
in Javascript and on top of
Mosca
. You can find the Eclipse Project Proposal here: http://eclipse.org/proposals/technology.ponte/
Contributing to Ponte
Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
Fork the project
Start a feature/bugfix branch
Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
Please try not to mess with the Makefile and package.json. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

Hi
@kartben
,
now when the changes have been merged and the voting is finished. Should we do something more so that I can get the commit rights?
what does the following mean?
"The next step is for the project lead to return to the portal and fill in the
VCS package and employer information for Jovan Kostovski."
Should
@mcollina
do something more?
BTW. My employer has nothing to do with Ponte. I am contributing to Ponte in my free time.
Best Regards,
Jovan
