Hi, why ping requests should be notified with interceptors, which is the use case for an application that embed Moquette to know each ping from every connected client? Il mer 5 giu 2019, 13:23 David Brooks <notifications@github.com> ha scritto:

Hi. The use case is purely from an Application Support view. Operationally these messages don’t do anything, but support teams like to see this sort of thing as confirmation that the client is still connected, still sending data and isn’t in some zombie state. In our app we have a status page for the broker showing the latest messages received and knowing pingreq is still happening is a useful feature for the support team

Hi
@djbr-david
I understand you requirements, we could have 2 solutions, in my opinion:
make the interceptors aware of the ping from client, but in a configurable manner, with a configuration property to switch on startup.
notify only when a client is not anymore alive which means connection closed or failed ping
Personally i prefer the second one, because the broker doesn't flood too much notification to the interceptors.
Would you like to provide an PR with this? In case remember to cover it with unit tests

Expected behavior
Moquette works without exceptions when receive many (1000 for example) messages
Actual behavior
Many exceptions when client (javascript Paho) send 1000 messages in loop.
Some first (300-400 messages) was processed normal, but then exceptions.
Steps to reproduce
Run Moquette.
Run javacript code in browser (Paho lib required)
Part of code:
Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code) or complete log file
Log with exception attached

Hi guys,
I am having some problems with the configuration of
MQTT throw SSL
, below description and useful code.
Description
I am trying to include moquette in my Java Project using SSL (8883), but somethings is wrong. Before checking SSL connection, I have configured standard connection throw 1883 port and tested with Paho Java Client, therefore this work correctly! Instead, SSL seems not listening to 8883 port and every connection is refused. The command
"netstat -aon | grep 8883"
commented
Mar 31, 2019
I ran into this exception when Moquette was running with QoS1 under heavy load.
It looks like Session#resendInflightNotAcked() was triggered, but it dealt with a ByteBuf already freed. After this exception, the channel didn't work at all and I think this is a critical bug.
I reproduced this bug as
ServerLowlevelMessagesIntegrationTests#testResendNotAckedPublishes
and I tried fixing it somehow by retaining the duplicated buffer. It works so far.

Please add the license file to the released artifact.
This makes usage of the broker much easier when using license checkers like WhiteSource.

I noticed Moquette users can't configure the number of Netty worker threads in current Moquette. Increasing Netty worker threads number is important in our use case that handles a lot of MQTT requests.
This PR makes it configurable.

Hi franscesco98,
I think that the problem that you're having is due to the fact that your jks file might not be found. In my own code I give the whole path from the /src folder
(jks_path src\main\java\com\mycompany\myproject\mqtt\broker\config\serverkeystore.jks).
without this path my code did not work for me eather.

Yeah. If you have any concern of memory leak, feel free to give me feedbacks. Thanks.
IMO, this issue occurs 100% when a subscriber takes time and potential memory leak may be better than it.
I think you can easily reproduce this issue by running
testResendNotAckedPublishes()
introduced by this pull request with commenting out the fix.

Hi,
I tested mqtt server with moquette 0.12.1 version with H2.

This is not necessary. Netty used asunch IO an Moquette is essentially IO bound so adding thread only adds threads that do IO waiting. The broker starts and Co figure the number of threads equals to the number of cores - 1, let this configurable to put for example 1000 threads it's a no sense, just adds weight to the scheduler and stole memory for each thread's stack.

I noticed Moquette users can't configure the number of Netty worker threads in current Moquette. Increasing Netty worker threads number is important in our use case that handles a lot of MQTT requests. This PR makes it configurable. ------------------------------ You can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:

When I first started testing, then It was done properly.
But, when all clients are disconnected and restarted testing, It can't use internalPublish methods.
It is the error log below.
I checked the subscription tree trace log.
When the exception occured, the subscription suddenly changed from CNode to TNode.
I added log to check Node type and token value in CTrie.java
Is there any way to solve this situation?

I have just question: Does Moquette support 2-way SSL authentication? I found in documentation section "SSL Configuration" (
https://moquette-io.github.io/moquette/documentation.html#_ssl_configuration
) but if I understand example correctly there is covered only "1-way" SSL authentication and client certificate is not verified by server.

Server
it would be expected that all related threads are closing.
Actual behavior
Invoking
stopServer
from class
Server
does not call to stop
BrokerInterceptor
thus the threads pool it created is never shutdown and some thread is kept in awaiting state. This leads to application hang running.
Steps to reproduce
Start
Server
Connect client to server, publish and subscribe to some topics
Stop server
Server.stopServer
Thread pool created by
BrokerInterceptor

Gradle 4.6 does not work with Java 11.
Update Gradle to newest version (5.6) along with errorprone and spotbugs in order to make moquette buildable with JDK 11. Compatibility with Java 8 is retained.

Hey,
thanks for putting this great work online! I was wondering if someone ever tried to create a broker + cleint on the same (Android) device. My app has a moquette broker app which connects just fine and receives commands sent from a second cellphone. The brokers' debug output is reflecting the topic, but the second device (ESP32) is not receiving anything - even though it's subscribed to this topic. Do you have any idea?
The debug-output is this one:
Any idea? Both devices are visible, but it seems, that the ESP32 is not subscribing to anything,, am I right?
Cheers and thanks for putting this up! :)

The problem is
here
. The "join" method is not implemented for some reason. I changed
this.topic = String.join("/", strTokens);
to
this.topic = "/"+strTokens;
This worked for me.

Is there a way I can disconnect a client(s) that have connected to a certain user/password combination?
I'm trying to dynamically create/remove users whilst the broke is running. If a client has already connected with a given user/password combination and I then remove it, I want to client to be told to disconnect, if this is doable.

You have to write some code to bridge it. Moquette exposes a set of Interceptor callback interfaces, you can implement the one you are interested in (for example a forwarder to Azure using some Azure HTTP endpoint or whatever protocol Azure use) and register in you embedded application.

This PR
fixes
#529
,
#505
.
In high load conditions, TNodes are not removed from the tree fast enough, and are evaluated when matching topics.
This PR moves the check that skips TNodes forward, before child nodes are even considered. As a side effect, no EmptySet is created and added to the matched subscriptions.

Suppose a mqtt client with a specific CLIENT-ID is connected to the server.
Now another mqtt client with the same CLIENT-ID wants to connect to the server.
I expect:
At first, the server disconnects the old client.
And then, the new client can connect to the server.
In implementation:
I expect the new client's thread waits for completing the old client disconnection and then do its task.
Actual behavior
In Actual case, I observed that :
processConnect()
will be called for the new client and because this CLIENT-ID exists in the sessions (due to the old client), So nothing is added to the sessions.
And concurrently the server disconnects the old client and remove it's session from
sessionRegistry
.
And Now when the new client wants to subscribe to a topic (after successfully connection),

Using Interceptor we can only send data to remote. What about to receive messages from remote? I have seen some blogs but there is no configuration here [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/how-to-bridge-mosquitto-mqtt-broker-to-aws-iot/]

This PR:
makes the changes needed for java 11+, mostly copied from
#498
.
Fixes
ServerIntegrationPahoCanPublishOnReadBlockedTopicTest
so it cleans up.
This fixes several following tests breaking.
Fixes the PostOffice throwing a NPE when clientId is null.
This fixes the test
ServerIntegrationSSLClientAuthTest > checkClientAuthenticationFail
.
Update the test certificates, adding the flag CA:true.
This fixes the error

What fixes
If another process is using the MQTT ports the server fails with an exception, now exit with error message. Fixed also the invokation of
readComplete
when a connection is not yet fully bootstrapped with MQTT, like when a connection is opened on an SSL port and the connection is closed without having fully bootstrapped the MQTT settngs.
Added specific handling for BindExcpetion when the port is occupied

There is a latency in the delivery of messages which seems to be from some buffering which flushes the messages only every few seconds. Is there a configuration where this latency can be reduced and the messages processed as soon as they come in?

Though I just noticed they are also missing for 0.12.
0.11 does have sources.

Hi,
I am working with embedded devices which are very limited in resources, and the server certificate verification takes a very long time. The server closes the connection after 10 seconds, far before the client has completed its computation to ask for the key exchange.
This timeout is set by
io.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler
. This handler is created in
NewNettyAcceptor#createSslHandler
. (I am using version 0.12.1, but I see nothing changed in master). When I call
SslHandler#setHandshakeTimeoutMillis

fixed throw NullPointerException when new connection
#519 opened
Mar 2, 2020

luoliangtiger
here, my problem is solved.
So I'd like to have the capability to provide this timeout value as a property for moquette. I believe it would be an interesting feature because MQTT is easily used on embedded devices, and SSL support is somewhat heavy, so my problem could be seen elsewhere.
I am ready to create a Pull Request if necessary, but I would be happy to hear your comments first on the subject.

It seems it does not always happen on my machine, but it's very reproducable on Travis. I've not been able to debug Moquette, since it does not compile on java 11.

I've made a little minimal test project / torture test for this problem that will usually give the above exception in a few seconds:
https://github.com/hylkevds/moquetteTests
What it does is:
It spins up a Moquette
It creates 1 client for publishing
It creates 10 threads for publishing data
each publishes on 1 topic
each publishes as fast as it can
It creates 1 (or more) thread for listening, each with its own client.
In a loop they:
connect,
subscribe to all topics
count received messages for 2000 ms
unsubscribe from all topics

ProTip!
Follow long discussions with
comments:>50
disconnect
sleep for 100 ms
If you increase the listener count to 10 or so, I also see lots of other exceptions and netty weirdness, but with just 1 client I only get the above exception.
I hope that helps you in finding the issue!

I managed to get moquette to compile with the help of PR
#498
and did a bit of debugging.
If the exception happens, it's because it is evaluating on a TNode, and I think TNodes should be excluded when fetching subscriptions from children:
in CTrie.java:86
But I've not fully gone through all details of your CTrie implementation, so I'm not sure this has no side effects.

This seems to be a duplicate of
#505
The solution proposed there is essentially the same: Don't process TNodes.
The test project above is still useful for finding problems though :)

For example, a Contributor might include the
Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this
section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the
other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program

the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program

in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not

Expected behavior
After reconnect of the same client with clean_session = false and subscribing to the same topic with QoS = 1 all missed messages should appear
Actual behavior
Exception is thrown while trying to resend unacked message:
Steps to reproduce
Run moquette broker
Publish messages every second to any topic, e.g. "/test-topic"
Run subscriber with client = "client123", clean_session = false and subscribe to topic "/test-topic" with QoS = 1
Kill subscriber
Rerun subscriber
Retry 4.-5. until you get an exception
Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code) or complete log file
Client using python 3.7

due to a timeout of a message in flight from broker to client. The PubRelMarker is a placeholder class that reppresents the PUBREL message from broker to a subscriber that want to receive messages at QoS2. Please, could you share a complete log file from bootstrap of the broker till the crash moquette.log and messages.logs? It could help a lot to understand/ reproduce, thanks
