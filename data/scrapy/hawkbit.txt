IoT. Update. Device.
Eclipse hawkBit™ is a domain independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking infrastructure.
Interfaces
hawkBit offers a direct device integration via HTTP or a device management federation API which allows to connect devices with different protocol adapter. Users can make use of the graphical user interface and other service can interact with hawkBit through the RESTful management API.
Rollout
hawkBit supports an easy and flexible rollout management which allows you to update a large amount of devices in separated groups.
Cascading start of the deployment groups based on installation status of the previous group.
Emergency shutdown of the rollout in case a group exceeds the defined error threshold.
Rollout progress monitoring for the entire rollout and the individual groups.
Package Model
A software update does not always contain only a single file. The hawkBit meta model allows you to configure your files in virtual software and distribution packages.

Software Modules
What is hawkBit?
Eclipse hawkBit™ is an domain-independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking infrastructure.
Why Software Updates in IoT?
Having software update capabilities ensures a secure IoT by means that it gives IoT projects a fighting chance against pandora’s box that they opened the moment their devices got connected. From that moment on devices are at the forefront of IT security threats many embedded software developers historically never had to face. Shipping for instance a Linux powered device connected to the Internet without any security updates ever applied during its lifetime is kind of a suicidal act these days.
A more charming argument for software update is that it enables agile development for hardware and hardware near development. Concepts like a minimum viable product can be applied for devices as not all features need to be ready at manufacturing time. Changes on the cloud side of the IoT project can be applied to the devices at runtime as well.
Sometimes Software Update is a business model on its own as it makes devices much more attractive to the customer if they are updateable, i.e. they do not only buy a product because of its current feature set but make also a bet on its future capabilities. In addition new revenue streams may arise from the fact that feature extensions can potentially be monetized (e.g. Apps) without the need to design, manufacture and ship a new device (revision).
Why hawkBit?
Updating software
(components) on constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways is as mentioned before a
common requirement
in most IoT scenarios.
At the time being, this process is
usually handled by the IoT solution itself
, sometimes backed by a full fledged device management system. We believe that this approach generates unnecessary
duplicate work
in the IoT space, in particular when considering the challenges of implementing a safe and reliable remote software update process: the software update process must never fail and also must never be compromised as, at the one hand, it can be used to fix almost any issue/problem on the device but at the same time also poses the greatest security threat if mis-used to introduce malicious code to the device.

Hello there noscripter!
CircleCI uses JavaScript pretty heavily to provide a good experience and to allow us to develop code a lot faster. We recognize that the tradeoff is that people using noscript get a worse experience, and we apologize for that.
So let us pitch you quickly on why you should enable JavaScript and view our site. CircleCI is
powerful, fast, and easy-to-use Continuous Integration and Deployment
for web applications.
CircleCI is easy to set up, incredibly fast, allows you to get your code to customers faster, and will even automatically parallelize your tests over many machines to get results to you faster. If that sounds useful, we'd encourage you to whitelist us in noscript and read about it yourself :)
In addition we believe the software update process to be relatively
independent from particular application domains
when seen from the back-end (cloud) perspective. Updating the software for an entire car may differ from updating the firmware of a single sensor with regard to the connectivity of the device to the cloud and also to the complexity of the software package update process on the device. However, the process of rolling out the software, e.g. uploading an artifact to the repository, assigning it to eligible devices, managing the roll out campaign for a large number of devices, orchestrating content delivery networks to distribute the package, monitoring and reporting the progress of the roll-out and last but not least requirements regarding security and reliability are quite similar.
Existing
device management systems
usually
lack
the capability to
efficiently organize roll outs at IoT scale
, e.g. splitting the roll out into sub groups, cascading them, automatically stopping the roll out after a defined error threshold etc. They are also usually restricted to a single device management protocol, either a proprietary one or one of the existing standard protocols like LWM2M, OMA-DM or TR-069. Even if they support more than one such protocol, they are often a result of the device management protocol they started with and restricted in their adoption capabilities to others.
device management system introduces unnecessary (and unwanted) complexity
to many IoT projects. This is particularly true for IoT solutions working with constrained devices where requirements regarding generic device management are often very limited only but a secure & reliable software update process is still mandatory.
As a result we have the need for a domain independent solution
that works for the majority of IoT projects
that goes beyond the pure update and handles more complex

Release
0.2.0
First Eclipse hawkBit release including:
Core features:
DistributionSet
. - Auto-splitting of the input target list into a defined number deployment groups. - Approval workflow - Has to be enabled explicitly in configuration. - Enables a workflow that requires a user with adequate permissions to review any new or updated rollout before it can be started. - Allows integration with 3rd party workflow engines.
Cascading start of the deployment groups based on installation status of the previous group.
Emergency shutdown of the rollout in case a group exceeds the defined error threshold.
Rollout progress monitoring for the entire rollout and the individual groups.
Cascading Deployment Group Execution
The cascading execution of the deployment groups is based on two thresholds that can be defined by the rollout creator. - success condition by means of percentage of successfully installed targets in the current groups triggers. - error condition by means of absolute or percentage of failed installations which triggers an emergency shutdown of the entire rollout.
Rollout state machine
State Machine on Rollout
State Machine on Rollout Deployment Group
Multi-Assignments (beta)
One of the main paradigms of Eclipse hawkBit is, that a Distribution Set represents the currently installed software of a device. Hence, a device can have only one Distribution Set assigned/installed at a time. With
Multi-Assignments
enabled, this paradigm shifts. Multi-Assignments allows to assign multiple Distribution Sets to a device simultaneously, without cancelling each other. As a consequence, an operator can trigger multiple campaigns addressing the same devices in parallel.

Direct Device Integration API
The hawkBit
update server
provides REST resources which are consumed by the device to retrieve software update tasks. This API is based on HTTP standards and a polling mechanism.
In DDI the target is identified using a
controllerId
. Controller is used as a term for the actual service/client on the device. That allows users to have in some cases even multiple clients on the same target for different tasks, e.g. Firmware update and App management.
State Machine Mapping
For historical reasons the DDI has a different state machine and status messages than the
Target State Machine
of the hawkBit update server.
This is kept in order to ensure that
DDI
stays compatible for devices out there in the field. A future version “2” of
DDI
might change that.

That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@Alexco500
This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like
"id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)"
. That means this condition is true if
id
is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator
=OUT=
meaning the condition is true only if the
id
is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

weight
is used. When multi-assignments is enabled every action has a weight value between (and including) 0 and 1000. The higher the weight the more important is the assignment represented by the action. Also when defining a
rollout
or an
auto-assignment
and multi-assignments is enabled a weight value has to be provided. This value is passed to the actions created during the execution of these
rollouts
and
auto-assignments
. If no weight was provided the highest value of 1000 is used instead.
Consequences
While this feature provides more flexibility to the user and enables new use-cases, there are also some consequences one should be aware of:
Critical
This feature is in beta and may change unannounced.
For now, this feature is
opt-in only
. Once activated, it cannot be deactivated.
405 Method Not Allowed
The http request method is not allowed on the resource.
406 Not Acceptable
In case accept header is specified and not application/json.
429 Too Many Request
Too many requests. The server will refuse further attempts and the client has to wait another second.
POST /rest/v1/softwaremodules
Implementation notes
Handles the POST request of creating new software modules within SP. The request body must always be a list of modules. Required Permission: CREATE_REPOSITORY

DDI
also defines more states than the update server, e.g. multiple DDI states are currently mapped by the
DDI
implementation to
RUNNING
state. It is possible that in the future hawkBit will fully leverage these additional states.
The
DDI
API allows the device to provide the following feedback messages:
DDI
status.execution
type
handling by update server
Mapped ActionStatus type
CANCELED
This is send by the target as confirmation of a cancellation request by the update server.
CANCELED

Description
limit
The maximum number of entries in a page (default is 50).
sort
The query parameter sort allows to define the sort order for the result of a query. A sort criteria consists of the name of a field and the sort direction (ASC for ascending and DESC descending). The sequence of the sort criteria (multiple can be used) defines the sort order of the entities in the result.
offset
The paging offset (default is 0).
q
Query fields based on the Feed Item Query Language (FIQL). See Entity Definitions for available fields.

Hi, is there any way to use the result of one filter in another filter? E.g. filter1 returns devices a,b,c and filter2 takes these applies the rules only on a,b,c instead of all devices. Or the opposite, filter2 uses all devices except for a,b,c.
Bondar Bogdan
@bogdan-bondar
@Alexco500
no, there is no relationship/hierarchy between filters, you could however just create a new one composing the predicates as you like with and/or operators, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/ui/#target-filter-management
Additionally, if you create a Rollout you can switch to the “Advanced Group definition” and select the particulat filter for each group that will pick up only the subset of the filter selected for the Rollout

Hello, is it possible to run hawkbit without the UI ? only backend
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Never tried it myself but could be possible with only a small dependency change. There is a dedicated hawkBit UI starter in place (cf.
@Sergey-G-dev
thanks for providing an example!
@Alexco500
it is kind of similar to the

I think I have not fully understood your questions. May I asked you to elaborate a bit more on that?
As far as I understood you’d like to always soft delete a software module?

While on DMF-API a MULTI_ACTION request is sent, DDI-API only exposes the next action which has the highest priority in the list of open actions(according to their weight property).
All information regarding the currently assigned or installed Distribution Set does only respect the last assignment, as well as the last successfully installed Distribution set. This also affects:
Pinning a target or Distribution Set in Deployment View.
Statistics about installed or assigned Distribution Sets.
Auto close running actions, when a new Distribution Set is assigned (
repository.actions.autoclose.enabled
) is deactivated.
Marking a Distribution Set to be a

REJECTED
This is send by the target in case an update of a cancellation is rejected, i.e. cannot be fulfilled at this point in time. Note: the target should send a CLOSED->ERROR if it believes it will not be able to proceed the action at all.
WARNING
CLOSED
Target completes the action either with
status.result.finished
SUCCESS or FAILURE as result. Note: DDI defines also a status NONE which will not be interpreted by the update server and handled like SUCCESS.
ERROR (DDI FAILURE) or FINISHED (DDI SUCCESS or NONE)
PROCEEDING
This can be used by the target to inform that it is working on the action.
RUNNING
SCHEDULED
This can be used by the target to inform that it scheduled on the action.
RUNNING
RESUMED
This can be used by the target to inform that it continued to work on the action.

Anyone know how i could do this, or if it is possible ?

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (
eclipse/hawkbit#1024
). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi, is there any way to use the result of one filter in another filter? E.g. filter1 returns devices a,b,c and filter2 takes these applies the rules only on a,b,c instead of all devices. Or the opposite, filter2 uses all devices except for a,b,c.
Bondar Bogdan
@bogdan-bondar
@Alexco500
no, there is no relationship/hierarchy between filters, you could however just create a new one composing the predicates as you like with and/or operators, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/ui/#target-filter-management
Additionally, if you create a Rollout you can switch to the “Advanced Group definition” and select the particulat filter for each group that will pick up only the subset of the filter selected for the Rollout

Never tried it myself but could be possible with only a small dependency change. There is a dedicated hawkBit UI starter in place (cf.

thanks for sharing your progress. Indeed it looks like that the env variable is not overwriting the pre-defined value hence
protocols
contains more than exected. I wouldn’t expect a difference here but hawkBit is running on
Spring Boot 2.1.x
. However the link you shared points to the latest version. I never tried env variables to overwide the ref. Does same issue occure if you add “-” to the env variable?
1 reply
BTW did you only set one env variable or all of them? rel, protocol, supports, ref and hostname?

Hi, is there any way to use the result of one filter in another filter? E.g. filter1 returns devices a,b,c and filter2 takes these applies the rules only on a,b,c instead of all devices. Or the opposite, filter2 uses all devices except for a,b,c.
Bondar Bogdan
@bogdan-bondar
@Alexco500
no, there is no relationship/hierarchy between filters, you could however just create a new one composing the predicates as you like with and/or operators, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/ui/#target-filter-management
Additionally, if you create a Rollout you can switch to the “Advanced Group definition” and select the particulat filter for each group that will pick up only the subset of the filter selected for the Rollout

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

"id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)"
. That means this condition is true if
id
is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator
=OUT=
meaning the condition is true only if the
id
is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.

This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like

@kwilcox
thanks for sharing your progress. Indeed it looks like that the env variable is not overwriting the pre-defined value hence
protocols
contains more than exected. I wouldn’t expect a difference here but hawkBit is running on
Spring Boot 2.1.x
. However the link you shared points to the latest version. I never tried env variables to overwide the ref. Does same issue occure if you add “-” to the env variable?
1 reply
BTW did you only set one env variable or all of them? rel, protocol, supports, ref and hostname?

@schabdo
We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (
eclipse/hawkbit#1024
). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.

MariaDB
instead of

. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:

Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser
that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.
here
). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as
MariaDB
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Never tried it myself but could be possible with only a small dependency change. There is a dedicated hawkBit UI starter in place (cf.
dependencies
).
hawkbit-boot-starter
is included within the hawkbit-update-server

@jmlups_gitlab
hmm i tried removing the dependencies from the file you mentioned, and another file, but the ui still boots

Hello, is there anything like database hooks on hawkbit ?
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@schabdo
We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (
eclipse/hawkbit#1024
). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

Hi Team, For business requirements sake, we want to force softDelete the softwares irrespective of if it has associated distribution/used. is there any way to force softDelete on softwareModules ?
@Alexco500
it is kind of similar to the
IN

@RajeshReddyKa_twitter
I think I have not fully understood your questions. May I asked you to elaborate a bit more on that?
As far as I understood you’d like to always soft delete a software module?

It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of
org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter
to
DEBUG
should be all you need
You can add the logger
here
. After that you should see one of
this
statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB
This should allow me upload up to 4 GB.
However, upload fails at limit of 1 GB:
2020-10-19 17:00:14.749 INFO 32155 --- [qtp942804532-20] o.e.h.u.a.u.AbstractFileTransferHandler : Upload started for file update-2020.10.14-1.raucb:v:1

If I don't put these values in application.properties upload stops right away, with repeated messages of size exceeding 1024MB
MariaDB
instead of
MySQL
. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to
jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true
will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize
and
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage
in bytes. Default values are

i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi Team, For business requirements sake, we want to force softDelete the softwares irrespective of if it has associated distribution/used. is there any way to force softDelete on softwareModules ?
Alexander Coers
@Alexco500
Hi, I still fail to understand the =IN= parameters in filter definitions. Can someone provide an example with some explanations, please (slightly more than the one in the docs: Use =IN= for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2) :-) )? Thanks in advance.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@Sergey-G-dev
Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?
That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.

This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like

Hello, I´m really new to hawkbit and try to setup oauth2 with AzureAD. I think I got it mostly but I still get a 404 after all the login magic
I guess I´m missing some mapping or something like that. Maybe anyone can give me a hint where to look

This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like
"id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)"
. That means this condition is true if
id
is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator
=OUT=
meaning the condition is true only if the
id
is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:

not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:
You just need a file named

not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:
You just need a file named
myTestFile.txt
within same path as you execute curl

One question regarding
#1024
- after fixing the issues mentioned by the hawkbit-bot, what's the preferred way of pushing them - should I do an amend commit + force push or just another usual commit and push?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev
we don’t enforce a special treatment here. It’s up to you what suits you best :+1:
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@schabdo
Alright, so I've fixed the issues and pushed the changes and requested a review by hawkbit-bot, but the bot hasn't done it yet. Does it need to be triggered manually? If so, how?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev
the bot only obey the owners :wink: So you did the hardest part already.
I’ll take care of the bot … and have a more detailed look as soon as I find time

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

hawkBit offers a direct device integration via HTTP or a device management federation API which allows to connect devices with different protocol adapter. Users can make use of the graphical user interface and other service can interact with hawkBit through the RESTful management API.
Rollout
hawkBit supports an easy and flexible rollout management which allows you to update a large amount of devices in separated groups.
Cascading start of the deployment groups based on installation status of the previous group.
Emergency shutdown of the rollout in case a group exceeds the defined error threshold.
Rollout progress monitoring for the entire rollout and the individual groups.
Package Model
A software update does not always contain only a single file. The hawkBit meta model allows you to configure your files in virtual software and distribution packages.

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB
This should allow me upload up to 4 GB.
However, upload fails at limit of 1 GB:
2020-10-19 17:00:14.749 INFO 32155 --- [qtp942804532-20] o.e.h.u.a.u.AbstractFileTransferHandler : Upload started for file update-2020.10.14-1.raucb:v:1

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser
that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.
here
). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as
MariaDB
instead of
MySQL
. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to
jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true
will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

RAUC hawkBit Client
The RAUC hawkBit client is a simple python-based library and example application that runs on your target and operates as an interface between the
RAUC
D-Bus API and the
hawkBit
DDI API.
Quickstart
Despite the rauc-hawkbit client is primarily meant to be used as a library, it also provides a simple example application that allows you to instantly start with a small configuration file.

@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
… however I filed an issue to support you better in this kind of setup (cf.
eclipse/hawkbit#1036
)
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@mdymov-hayward
nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo
It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser
that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.
here
). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as
MariaDB
instead of
MySQL
. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to
jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true
will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Background
Work on the RAUC hawkBit client started at
Pengutronix
in the middle of 2016 as part of a customer's project and for demonstration purposes. In May 2017 the decision was made to restructure and clean up the code and publish it as Open Source software.
Example Usage
The
RaucDBUSDDIClient
class from the
rauc_hawkbit

thank you !!

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

@mikhailtchernychev
Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB
This should allow me upload up to 4 GB.
not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:
You just need a file named
myTestFile.txt
within same path as you execute curl
Jalal
@jmlups_gitlab
ok i'll try that thanks
@schabdo
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
@bogdan-bondar
Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line:
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296
and it fixed the problem.
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
But still need it application.properties file something like that:
Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

Please help.

this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize
and
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage
in bytes. Default values are
1_073_741_824

We offer a sandbox installation that is free for everyone to try out hawkBit. However, keep in mind that the sandbox database will be reset from time to time. It is also not possible to upload any artifacts into the sandbox. But you can use it to try out the Management UI, Management API and DDI API. Keep in mind as well that you are not permitted to store any kind of personal data in the sandbox.
https://hawkbit.eclipse.org
In addition the following vendors offer free trial accounts for their hawkBit compatible products:
Bosch IoT Rollouts
Kynetics Update Factory
Device Integration
hawkBit does not provide off the shelf clients for devices as part of the project. The long term goal is to provide an
Eclipse hono
integration which will provide connectivity through various IoT protocols and as a result allows a wide range of clients to connect to hawkBit. However, the hawkBit
Direct Device Integration (API) API
is HTTP/JSon based which should allow any update client to integrate quite easily.
There are clients outside of the Eclipse IoT eco system as well, e.g.:
SWupdate
which is a Linux Update agent with focus on a efficient and safe way to update embedded systems.

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of

to

should be all you need
You can add the logger

Refactoring:
Provide interface on top of *management implementations.
Make entities immutable and create proper update methods that state by signature what can be updated.
Introduce builder pattern for EntityFactory create methods and repository update methods.
Use IDs in signatures for searches, not complete entities
Consistent usage of Java 8 Optional in the interfaces (Repo shall never return null!)
Remove TargetInfo interfaces as this does not belong into the API. The very existence of this object is very Spring Data/JPA specific.
Consistent usage of paging (make sure that we never query everything)
Fix DMF model name clashes by means of renaming DMF model in similar pattern to the other APIs.
Check if we really always ned Page or is Slice sufficient
Split management services (e.g. DS and DS type)
Consistent naming of methods (see below)
Remove boiler plate

nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

Eclipse hawkBit™ - Examples collection
Example projects that show how
hawkBit
can be customized or hawkBit compatible APIs leveraged.
API client examples
hawkbit-example-ddi-feign-client
: Example client based on the feign project for hawkBit's
Direct Device Integration API
.
hawkbit-example-mgmt-feign-client
: Example client based on the feign project for hawkBit's
Management API
Simulators
hawkbit-device-simulator
: Simulates device software updates, leveraging the hawkBit device integration options.
module allows you to simply setup an interface between RAUC and hawkBit.
If you only want use the hawkBit interface from your python project, you can use the DDIClient class.
Debugging
When setting the log level to 'debug' the RAUC hawkBit client will print API URLs and JSON payload sent and received. This can be done either by setting
log_level
from the config file
or by providing the
-d
(
--debug
) switch when calling the client.

i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Data Model
The hawkBit data model was designed to have enough flexibility to define complex software structures (e.g. operating system, runtimes, apps, different kind of artifacts) on one side and simplicity compared to the capabilities of a full blown configuration management on the other.
It does define a hierarchy of software that starts with a distribution, which can have (sub-)modules and these may have multiple artifacts. However, it does not consider any kind of dependency definitions between modules or artifacts. As a result dependency checks if necessary have to be done outside hawkBit, i.e. on the device itself or before the entity creation in hawkBit by the origin.

Provisioning Target Definition
A Provisioning Target is a neutral definition that may be an actual real device (e.g. gateway, embedded sensor) or a virtual device (e.g. vehicle, smart home).
The definition in hawkBit might reflect the transactional behavior if necessary on the device side. A vehicle might be updated device by device or as a whole. As a result one way of defining a vehicle in hawkBit could be to have one all inclusive Software Module or one module per (sub-) device.
Software Structure Definition
The structure defines the model of the supported software by the provisioning target
Distribution Set Type: defines a package structure that is supported by certain devices Consists of Software Module Types both for Firmware - device can have only one module of that type (e.g. the operating system) Software - device can have multiple modules of that type (e.g. “Apps”) Software Content Definition
Distribution Set: can be deployed to a provisioning target Software Module: is a sub element of the distribution e.g. OS, application, firmware X, firmware Y Artifact: binaries for a software module. Note: the decision which artifacts have to be downloaded are done on the device side. e.g. Full package, signatures, binary deltas
Entity Relationships
The public defined entities and their relation which are reflected by the Management API.
Deleting and Archiving Software Modules
When a user deletes a Software Module, the update server cannot simply remove all the corresponding data. Because when the Software Module is already assigned to a Distribution Set or was assigned to a Target in the past, the hawkBit server has to make sure that remains a clean and full update history for every target. The history contains all information (e.g. name, version) of the software, which was assigned to a specific Target. Obviously storing the binary data of the artifacts is not necessary for the history purpose.
The delete process which is performed, when there are historical connections to targets is called SoftDelete. This process marks the Software Module as deleted and removes the artifact, but it won’t delete the meta data, which describes the SoftwareModule and the associated Artifacts. SoftwareModules, which are marked as delete won’t be visible for the user, when he is requesting all SoftwareModules.
Just in case there are no connections to Distribution Sets and targets the server will perform a HardDelete. This process deletes all stored data, including all meta information.
In case of of a SoftDelete the unique constraints are still in place, i.e. you cannot create an entity with the same name/key. This constraint might be removed in future versions because of the impact on the user experience (i.e. he does not see the soft deleted module but cannot create a new one).

In a Nutshell, Eclipse hawkBit...
...
has had
2,477 commits
made by
66 contributors
representing
125,764 lines of code
...
Authorization is handled separately for
Direct Device Integration (DDI) API
and
Device Management Federation (DMF) API
(where successful authentication includes full authorization) and
Management API
and
UI
which is based on Spring security
authorities
.
However, keep in mind that hawkBit does not offer an off the shelf authentication provider to leverage these permissions and the underlying multi user/tenant capabilities of hawkBit but it supports authentication providers offering an OpenID Connect interface. Check out
Spring security documentation
for further information. In hawkBit
SecurityAutoConfiguration
is a good starting point for integration.
The default implementation is single user/tenant with basic auth and the logged in user is provided with all permissions. Additionally, the application properties may be configured for multiple static users; see
Multiple Users
for details.

The Management API is a RESTful API that enables to perform Create/Read/Update/Delete operations for provisioning targets (i.e. devices) and repository content (i.e. software).
Based on the Management API you can manage and monitor software update operations via HTTP/HTTPS. The
Management API
supports JSON payload with hypermedia as well as filtering, sorting and paging. Furthermore the Management API provides permission based access control and standard roles as well as custom role creation.
The API is protected and needs authentication and authorization based on the security concept.
API Version
hawkBit provides an consistent Management API interface that guarantees backwards compatibility for future releases by version control.
The current version of the Management API is
version 1 (v1)
with the URI
http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/
API Resources
Supported HTTP-methods are:
GET
This guide provides details about using and creating themes that control the visual look of Eclipse hawkBit Management UI. Theme customization is done using Sass, which is an extension of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
The mechanism described below is the rather simple case by customizing the theme by means of configuring a set of variables as defined by the hawkBit default theme. A full customization be means of copying the hawkBit theme and customize it completely is not described here but of course possible.
Example App
An example application with customized theme can be found
here
.
Overview
Vaadin separates the appearance of the user interface from its logic using themes. Themes can include Sass or CSS style sheets, custom HTML layouts, and any necessary graphics.
Theme resources can also be accessed from application code as ThemeResource objects. Custom themes are placed under the src/main/resources/VAADIN/themes/ folder of the application.
This location is fixed – the VAADIN folder contains static resources that are served by the Vaadin servlet. The servlet augments the files stored in the folder by resources found from corresponding VAADIN folders contained in JARs in the class path.The base theme and all the corresponding custom themes are placed under the above mentioned folder.
If a new custom theme has to be created, it should always be placed under the src/main/resources/VAADIN/themes/ folder.
Every custom theme should always refer the base theme and customization can be done by the use of variables mentioned in the XXXXvariable.scss. For details of the creation of the custom theme please refer the next section.
Procedure to create a theme
Create a new folder
“XXXtheme”
hawkBit is able to run in a cluster with some constraints. This guide provides insights in the basic concepts and how to setup your own cluster. You can find additional information in the
hawkBit runtimes’s README
.
Big picture
Events
Event communication between nodes is based on
Spring Cloud Bus
and
Spring Cloud Stream
. There are different
binder implementations
available. The
hawkbit Update Server
uses RabbitMQ binder. Every node gets his own queue to receive cluster events, the default payload is JSON. If an event is thrown locally at one node, it will be automatically delivered to all other available nodes via the Spring Cloud Bus’s topic exchange:
Via the ServiceMatcher you can check whether an event happened locally at one node or on a different node.
serviceMatcher.isFromSelf(event)
Caching
Every node is maintaining its own caches independent from other nodes. So there is no globally shared/synchronized cache instance within the cluster. In order to keep nodes in sync a TTL (time to live) can be set for all caches to ensure that after some time the cache is refreshed from the database. To enable the TTL just set the property “hawkbit.cache.global.ttl” (value in milliseconds). Of course you can implement a shared cache, e.g. Redis. See

DDI API
An authenticated target is permitted to: - retrieve commands from the server - provide feedback to the the server - download artifacts that are assigned to it
A target might be permitted to download artifacts without authentication (if enabled, see above). Only the download can be permitted to disable the authentication. This can be used in scenarios where the artifacts itself are e.g. signed and secured.
Management API and UI
Multiple Users
hawkBit optionally supports configuring multiple static users through the application properties. In this case, the user and password Spring security properties are ignored. An example configuration is given below.
A permissions value of
ALL
will provide that user with all possible permissions. Passwords need to be specified with the used password encoder in brackets. In this example,
noop
bcrypt
. See this
blog post
for more information on password encoders in Spring Security.

DDI API Authentication Modes
Security Token
hawkBit supports multiple ways to authenticate a target against the server. The different authentication modes can be individual enabled and disabled within hawkBit. Both on system level (with Spring Boot properties) as per individual tenant.
Target Security Token Authentication
There is a 32 alphanumeric character security-token for each created target within IoT hawkBit. This token can be used to authenticate the target at hawkBit through the HTTP-Authorization header with the custom scheme
TargetToken
.
The target security token is provided in
DMF API
as part of the update message in order to allow DMF clients to leverage the feature or can it be manually retrieved per target by
Management API
or in the
Management UI
in the target details.
Note: needs to be enabled in your hawkBit installation
and
in the tenant configuration. That allows both the operator as well as the individual customer (if run in a multi-tenant setup) to enable this access method. See

Status and API stability
hawkBit is currently in '0.X' semantic version. That is due to the need that there is still content in hawkBit that is in need for refactoring. That includes the maven module structure, Spring Boot Properties, Spring Boot auto configuration as well as internal Java APIs (e.g. the
repository API
).
However, the device facing

The update server can in fact be run stand alone. However, only with an embedded H2, no Device Management Federation API and no artifact storage.
System Architecture
This guide describes a target architecture that is more like one that you will expect in a production system.
hawkBit
Update Server
.
MariaDB
for the repository.
RabbitMQ
for DMF communication.
For testing and demonstration purposes we will also use:
hawkBit Device Simulator
.
hawkBit Management API example client
.

Create a folder named as
“customstyles”
.
Create a
XXXvariables.scss
file under

folder, putting all the variables inside the same file. For more details about the variables we recommend to take a look at the
hawkBit defaults
.
Create

Any images should be placed under the sub folder
CacheAutoConfiguration
Schedulers
Every node has multiple schedulers which run after a defined period of time. All schedulers always run on every node. This has to be kept in mind e.g. if the scheduler executes critical code which has to be executed only once.
Known constraints
UI sessions
As of today hawkBit is not storing user sessions in a shared, cluster wide cache. Session is only bound to the node where the login took place. If this node is going down for whatever reason, the session is lost and the user is forced to login again. In case that’s not an option, you can help yourself by introducing a shared session cache based on e.g. Redis. Furthermore hawkBit is not supporting session stickiness out of the box either. However most of the well known load balancer out there can solve this issue.
Caching of download IDs
The downloadId is generated and stored in the DownloadIdCache. It is used for downloading an artifact. In hawkBit exists an interface called “
DownloadIdCache
” and one implementation of it: “DefaultDownloadIdCache”. This default implementation can’t be used within a cluster. Its containing data is only available inside one node and can’t be shared with other nodes. E.g. the downloadId which is stored in this cache after authentication on node A can only be used for downloading the artifact by node A. In a cluster-capable environment this fact can lead to issues as it could happen, that the downloadId is stored on node A and node B would like to download the artifact by means of the downloadId which is not available on node B. To solve this issue you can use a cluster-shared cache e.g. Redis or create a new cluster-aware implementation of the interface “DownloadIdCache”.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) filter
hawkBit owns the feature of guarding itself from DoS attacks, a
DoS filter
. It reduces the maximum number of requests per seconds which can be configured for read and write requests. This mechanism is only working for every node separately, i.e. in a cluster environment the worst-case behaviour would be that the maximum number of requests per seconds will be increased to its product if every request is handled by a different node. The same constraint exists with the validator to check if a user tried too many logins within a defined period of time.

DdiSecurityProperties
for system wide enablement.
The additional activation for the individual tenant:
Gateway Security Token Authentication
Often the targets are connected through a gateway which manages the targets directly and as a result are indirectly connected to the hawkBit update server.
To authenticate this gateway and allow it to manage all target instances under its tenant there is a
GatewayToken
to authenticate this gateway through the HTTP-Authorization header with a custom scheme
GatewayToken
. This is of course also handy during development or for testing purposes. However, we generally recommend to use this token with care as it allows to act
in the name of
any device.
Note: needs to be enabled in your hawkBit installation
and
in the tenant configuration. That allows both the operator as well as the individual customer (if run in a multi-tenant setup) to enable this access method. See
DdiSecurityProperties
for system wide enablement.

DDI client resources
. A small
simulator application
demonstrates how you can interact with the hawkBit via the
Management API
.
Example Management API simulator
In the follow code section, you can a see a feign client resource example. The interface extend the origin api interface to declare the
@FeignClient
. The
@FeignClient
declares that a REST client with that interface should be created.
This interface can be autowired and use as a normal java interface:
At
hawkbit-example-core-feign-client
is a spring configuration to auto configure some beans, which can be reused for a own feign client.
Prerequisites
You have a working
hawkBit core build
.
You have a working
hawkBit examples build
.
Adapt hawkBit Update Server and Device Simulator to your environment.
As mentioned you can create your own application with hawkBit inside or adapt the existing example app. The second option will be shown here.
Set MariaDB dependency to compile in the
update server POM
Configure MariaDB/MySQL connection settings.
For this you can either edit the existing
application.properties
or create a
new profile
.
Configure RabbitMQ connection settings for update server and device simulator (optional).

Anonymous access
Here we offer general anonymous access for all targets (see
DdiSecurityProperties
) which we consider not really sufficient for a production system but it might come in handy to get a project started in the beginning.
However, anonymous download on the other side might be interesting even in production for scenarios where the artifact itself is already encrypted.

This has to be done before the device simulator is started. hawkBit creates the mandatory tenant metadata with first login into either
Management UI
or API (which is done by this client).
However, this is not done by
DMF
which is in fact used by the device simulator, i.e. without calling
Management API
first hawkBit would drop all
DMF
messages as the tenant is unknown.
Compile & Run device simulator (optional)

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB
This should allow me upload up to 4 GB.
However, upload fails at limit of 1 GB:

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB
This should allow me upload up to 4 GB.

not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:
You just need a file named
myTestFile.txt
within same path as you execute curl

Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line:
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296
and it fixed the problem.
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
But still need it application.properties file something like that:
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB

Hello, I´m really new to hawkbit and try to setup oauth2 with AzureAD. I think I got it mostly but I still get a 404 after all the login magic
I guess I´m missing some mapping or something like that. Maybe anyone can give me a hint where to look

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have

spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MB

spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB
This should allow me upload up to 4 GB.
However, upload fails at limit of 1 GB:

RalfMengwasser
@RalfMengwasser

now why is MariaDB 10.5 not supported? where can I read up on that?
RalfMengwasser

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

Hi, I still fail to understand the =IN= parameters in filter definitions. Can someone provide an example with some explanations, please (slightly more than the one in the docs: Use =IN= for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2) :-) )? Thanks in advance.

Hello, I´m really new to hawkbit and try to setup oauth2 with AzureAD. I think I got it mostly but I still get a 404 after all the login magic
I guess I´m missing some mapping or something like that. Maybe anyone can give me a hint where to look

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser
that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.
here
). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as
MariaDB
instead of
MySQL
. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to
jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true
will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!
The maximum number of entries in a page (default is 50).
sort
The query parameter sort allows to define the sort order for the result of a query. A sort criteria consists of the name of a field and the sort direction (ASC for ascending and DESC descending). The sequence of the sort criteria (multiple can be used) defines the sort order of the entities in the result.
offset
The paging offset (default is 0).
q
Query fields based on the Feed Item Query Language (FIQL). See Entity Definitions for available fields.

MySQL 5.6 will reach EOL in 2021. Flyway

is the latest version still supporting MySQL 5.6. We won't be able to upgrade to a more recent version of Flyway until we discontinue support for MySQL 5.6 and move on to MySQL 5.7+.
Furthermore new version of Flyway will have better support for MariaDB by means forcing the JDBC driver to report MariaDB as a MySQL is not required anymore (cf.

MariaDB connector parameters

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (
eclipse/hawkbit#1024
). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

Hello, I´m really new to hawkbit and try to setup oauth2 with AzureAD. I think I got it mostly but I still get a 404 after all the login magic

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

@mdymov-hayward
nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo
It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize
and
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage
in bytes. Default values are
1_073_741_824
(1GB) for max artifact size and

i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have

This should allow me upload up to 4 GB.
However, upload fails at limit of 1 GB:

The technical identifier of the entity
Request query parameter
Parameter
Description
limit
The maximum number of entries in a page (default is 50).
sort
The query parameter sort allows to define the sort order for the result of a query. A sort criteria consists of the name of a field and the sort direction (ASC for ascending and DESC descending). The sequence of the sort criteria (multiple can be used) defines the sort order of the entities in the result.
offset
The paging offset (default is 0).
q

is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (
eclipse/hawkbit#1024

This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like

id
is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator
=OUT=

this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:

Hi, I still fail to understand the =IN= parameters in filter definitions. Can someone provide an example with some explanations, please (slightly more than the one in the docs: Use =IN= for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2) :-) )? Thanks in advance.

that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.
here
). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as
MariaDB
instead of
MySQL
. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to
jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true
will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

@RalfMengwasser
i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of
org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter
to
DEBUG
should be all you need
You can add the logger
here
. After that you should see one of
this
statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.

that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.

A target has a current state which reflects the provisioning status of the device at this point in time. State changes are driven either by the update server by means of starting an update or by the controller on the provisioning target that gives feedback to the update server, e.g. “I am here”, “I am working on a provisioning”, “I have finished a provisioning”.
Defined states

- after fixing the issues mentioned by the hawkbit-bot, what's the preferred way of pushing them - should I do an amend commit + force push or just another usual commit and push?

Alright, so I've fixed the issues and pushed the changes and requested a review by hawkbit-bot, but the bot hasn't done it yet. Does it need to be triggered manually? If so, how?

Yes... But i observe softDelete only happens when softwareModule has distribution. Is there any alternative to always softDelete so we can preserve all softwaremodules ?

this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize
and
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage
in bytes. Default values are
1_073_741_824
(1GB) for max artifact size and
21_474_836_480
(20GB) for max artifact storage

not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:
You just need a file named
myTestFile.txt
within same path as you execute curl

nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of
org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter
to
DEBUG
should be all you need
You can add the logger
here
. After that you should see one of
this
statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo
It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of
org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter
to
DEBUG
should be all you need
You can add the logger

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

You just need a file named

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

@RalfMengwasser
that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.

MariaDB
instead of
MySQL

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',

i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hello, is it possible to run hawkbit without the UI ? only backend
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Never tried it myself but could be possible with only a small dependency change. There is a dedicated hawkBit UI starter in place (cf.
dependencies
).
hawkbit-boot-starter
is included within the hawkbit-update-server

Yes, by default H2 (in memory DB) is used for all the metadata that’s most likely the reason. You better switch to a “real” DB e.g. MySQL

thanks for sharing your progress. Indeed it looks like that the env variable is not overwriting the pre-defined value hence
protocols
contains more than exected. I wouldn’t expect a difference here but hawkBit is running on
Spring Boot 2.1.x
. However the link you shared points to the latest version. I never tried env variables to overwide the ref. Does same issue occure if you add “-” to the env variable?

not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:
You just need a file named
myTestFile.txt
within same path as you execute curl
Jalal
@jmlups_gitlab
ok i'll try that thanks
@schabdo
Please help.

this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize
and
hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage
in bytes. Default values are
1_073_741_824
(1GB) for max artifact size and
21_474_836_480
(20GB) for max artifact storage

Hello, is there anything like database hooks on hawkbit ?
I would like to synchronize a database with hawkbits', and i need some way to be informed whenever hawkbits' database changes .
Anyone know how i could do this, or if it is possible ?

Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
i tried removing the dependencies from the file you mentioned
@jmlups_gitlab
I’ll try-out and let you know the results
It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of
org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter
to
DEBUG
should be all you need
You can add the logger
here
. After that you should see one of
this
statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hi, is there any way to use the result of one filter in another filter? E.g. filter1 returns devices a,b,c and filter2 takes these applies the rules only on a,b,c instead of all devices. Or the opposite, filter2 uses all devices except for a,b,c.
@kwilcox
thanks for sharing your progress. Indeed it looks like that the env variable is not overwriting the pre-defined value hence
protocols
contains more than exected. I wouldn’t expect a difference here but hawkBit is running on
Spring Boot 2.1.x
. However the link you shared points to the latest version. I never tried env variables to overwide the ref. Does same issue occure if you add “-” to the env variable?

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (
eclipse/hawkbit#1024
). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

no, there is no relationship/hierarchy between filters, you could however just create a new one composing the predicates as you like with and/or operators, see:
https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/ui/#target-filter-management
Additionally, if you create a Rollout you can switch to the “Advanced Group definition” and select the particulat filter for each group that will pick up only the subset of the filter selected for the Rollout

nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

Hi, I still fail to understand the =IN= parameters in filter definitions. Can someone provide an example with some explanations, please (slightly more than the one in the docs: Use =IN= for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2) :-) )? Thanks in advance.

Hello, is there anything like database hooks on hawkbit ?
I would like to synchronize a database with hawkbits', and i need some way to be informed whenever hawkbits' database changes .
Anyone know how i could do this, or if it is possible ?

Never tried it myself but could be possible with only a small dependency change. There is a dedicated hawkBit UI starter in place (cf.

is included within the hawkbit-update-server

nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

@RalfMengwasser
that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf.
here
). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as
MariaDB
instead of
MySQL
. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.

Management API
The Management API is a RESTful API that enables to perform Create/Read/Update/Delete operations for provisioning targets (i.e. devices) and repository content (i.e. software).
[...]
Direct Device Integration API
The hawkBit
update server
provides REST resources which are consumed by the device to retrieve software update tasks. This API is based on HTTP standards and a polling mechanism.
[...]
Device Management Federation API
The DMF API provides Java classes which allows that the message body can be deserialized at runtime into a Java object. Also Java classes can be used to serialize Java objects into JSON bodies to send a message to hawkBit. Currently, bodies of messages are based on JSON.

This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like
"id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)"
. That means this condition is true if
id
is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator
=OUT=
meaning the condition is true only if the
id
is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

Restructuring of UI permissions required for reading/changing the metadata according to management permissions definitions. Previously Metadata was not visible under Target Details in Deployment View du to wrongly configured "Create Repository" permission instead of "Read repository". Additionally for creating/deleting the metadata entries "Update Repository" permission are used that corresponds to the Management layer.

We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (

One question regarding

- after fixing the issues mentioned by the hawkbit-bot, what's the preferred way of pushing them - should I do an amend commit + force push or just another usual commit and push?

Hi, I still fail to understand the =IN= parameters in filter definitions. Can someone provide an example with some explanations, please (slightly more than the one in the docs: Use =IN= for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2) :-) )? Thanks in advance.

Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?
That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.

We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (
eclipse/hawkbit#1024
). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

With this change the permission "UPDATE_REPOSITORY" is now sufficient to delete meta data? Is this intended?

. Please revert this anyways to

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MB
hawkbit/CONTRIBUTING.md at master · eclipse/hawkbit · GitHub
Device Management Federation API
The DMF API provides Java classes which allows that the message body can be deserialized at runtime into a Java object. Also Java classes can be used to serialize Java objects into JSON bodies to send a message to hawkBit. Currently, bodies of messages are based on JSON.
Basics
There are three basic concepts of AMQP:
Exchanges - what you publish to.
Queues - what you consume from.
Bindings - configuration that maps an exchange to a queue.
Queues
are just a place for receiving messages.
Bindings determine how messages get put in this place Queues can also be bound to multiple exchanges.
Exchanges
are just publish messages. The user decides who can produce on an exchange and who can create bindings on that exchange for delivery to a specific queue.
hawkBit will create all necessary queues, exchanges and bindings for the user, making it easy to get started. The exchange name for outgoing messages is
dmf.exchange
.

The user has to set a

The following chapter describes the message body, header and properties.
Note: the DMF protocol was intended to be compatible to other use cases by design. As a result, DMF uses the term

Auto assignment
It is possible to assign some distribution set with different action types (
forced
,
soft
, or
download only
) to all targets that belong to the corresponding custom target filter, including the ones, that are registered later on.
In order to activate the auto-assignment, one should first click on
Auto assignment
cell in Custom Filters table, and then check the corresponding checkbox. After that, the action type and distribution set for auto-assignment should be selected and confirmed.
As long as the auto-assignment stays active, the scheduler will try to assign selected distribution set to corresponding custom filter targets, that have never seen it before.

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',
haven't found any issue about this on github,
i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.
In the config/application.properties file I have
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MB
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB
This should allow me upload up to 4 GB.
However, upload fails at limit of 1 GB:
2020-10-19 17:00:14.749 INFO 32155 --- [qtp942804532-20] o.e.h.u.a.u.AbstractFileTransferHandler : Upload started for file update-2020.10.14-1.raucb:v:1

If I don't put these values in application.properties upload stops right away, with repeated messages of size exceeding 1024MB

Utility library usage
hawkBit has currently both
guava
and
Apache commons lang
on the classpath in several of its modules. However, we see introducing too many utility libraries problematic as we force these as transitive dependencies on hawkBit users. We in fact are looking into reducing them in future not adding new ones.
So we kindly ask contributors:
not introduce extra utility library dependencies
keep them out of the core modules (e.g. hawkbit-core, hawkbit-rest-core, hawkbit-http-security) to avoid that all modules have them as transitive dependency
use Spring utility classes if feasible

hawkBit
ist ein Projekt der
Eclipse IoT Working Group
, die eine offene Plattform für das Internet der Dinge schaffen will. Ziel des hawkBit-Projekts ist es, ein Framework bereitzustellen, das es einfach möglich macht, die Funktionalität „Softwareupdate“ in eine IoT-Lösung oder -Plattform zu bringen.
Test types are:
Unit Tests - for single units tests with a mocked environment
Component Tests - for complete components including lower layers, e.g. Spring MVC test on rest API including repository and database.
Integration Tests - including clients, e.g. Selenium UI tests with various browsers.
System Tests - on target environments, e.g. Cloud Foundry.
Examples for hawkBit components:
Management API
Direct Device Integration API
Device Management Federation API
Management UI
Repository
Security

Das Ausrollen von Software auf Embedded-Steuergeräte bis hin zu mächtigeren Gateways ist eine typische Anforderung, die uns in den meisten IoT-Projekten begegnet. Softwareupdates für Geräte abbilden zu können, eröffnet dem jeweiligen Projekt eine Reihe neuer Möglichkeiten: Zunächst einmal einen Weg, um der zunehmenden Anzahl von Sicherheitsproblemen zu begegnen. Sobald ein Gerät „connected“ ist, bietet sich eine komplett neue Angriffsfläche, auf die Embedded-Software- und Hardwareentwickler nun vorbereitet sein müssen.
Erfreulicher ist die Möglichkeit, mit Softwareupdate den Embedded-Software-Entwicklern ein agiles Entwicklungsmodell zu ermöglichen, das nicht mehr verlangt, alle Funktionen des Geräts zum Fertigungszeitpunkt der Hardware komplett ausimplementiert haben zu müssen.
Hier und dort ist Softwareupdate per se auch ein Geschäftsmodell. Es kann ein Produkt für den Konsumenten deutlich attraktiver machen, da er es nicht nur mit einem Umfang X kauft, sondern mit dem Versprechen auf die zukünftige Entwicklung des Produkts. Bei Smartphones oder PCs ist das schon lange selbstverständlich. In traditionellen Branchen, für die das IoT jetzt spannend wird, bisher weniger. Tesla ist ein Beispiel für die Vermarktung des Softwareupdates als Produktfeature aus einer Branche, in der bisher nur wenig „connected“ war. Zusätzlich kann auch das Verkaufen von nachgelieferten Funktionen („Apps“) ein interessantes Geschäftsmodell in den neuen IoT-Domänen sein.
Wir müssen dabei beachten, dass Cloud-gestützte Softwareupdates im IoT-Kontext eine ganze Reihe Herausforderungen mit sich bringen, die wir aus dem Aktualisieren von Servern, PCs oder Smartphones so nicht kennen. Positiv steht dem gegenüber, dass Softwareupdate als Funktion im IoT aus Backend-Sicht relativ unabhängig von der konkreten Domäne ist und daher auch nur einmal implementiert werden muss. Das Aktualisieren eines „Smart Homes“, einer Fertigungsstraße oder eines Fahrzeugs bringt im Kern die gleichen Anforderungen mit sich, unterscheidet sich aber sicherlich zum Beispiel hinsichtlich der Sicherheitsanforderungen und natürlich bei dem, was auf dem Gerät selbst passiert.
Eclipse hawkBit wurde als Projekt gestartet, um genau diesen domänenunabhängigen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden. Dazu stellt hawkBit eine Reihe Fähigkeiten bereit:
Ein Geräte- und Software-Repository
Schnittstellen zur flexiblen Geräteintegration
Benutzeroberfläche und Schnittstellen zum Durchführen der Softwareupdateoperationen und dem Verwalten des Repositories
Eine moderne, auf Spring Boot basierende Architektur, die es einfach ermöglicht, hawkBit an die eigenen Bedürfnisse anzupassen
Nicht funktional geht es dazu noch um:
Schnittstellenstabilität für langlebige Geräte
Schnittstellenflexibilität für die Geräteintegration im Projekt
Funktionale Skalierbarkeit für große Roll-outs im IoT-Kontext
Ende-zu-Ende-Sicherheit im Softwareupdateprozess

Eclipse hawkBit bringt bisher allerdings keine fertigen Geräteclients mit. Hier hofft das Projekt auf die aktive Mitarbeit der Community.
Die Anforderungen
Kommen wir nun zu den Spezialitäten bei den Anforderungen. Sie hängen stark mit der einfachen Wahrheit zusammen, dass der Softwareupdateprozess der eine Prozess ist, der niemals versagen darf. Er kann die größte Rettung für ein IoT-System sein, da mit einem erfolgreichen Update fast jedes Problem auf dem Gerät behoben werden kann. Schnittstellen in die Cloud können zudem angepasst und erweitert werden, um zu dortigen Änderungen kompatibel zu bleiben. Auf der anderen Seite ist das Update aber auch das größte Risiko für das Gerät, da damit praktisch jeder Sicherheitsmechanismus ausgehebelt werden kann.
Auch hängt die Überlebensfähigkeit des Geräts davon ab, dass der Softwareupdatemechanismus stabil über die Lebensdauer des Geräts funktioniert. Dies sind oftmals Jahre oder gar Jahrzehnte. Auch ist das manuelle Eingreifen eines Gerätebenutzers im IoT-Kontext, anders als bei PC und Smarthone, oftmals keine (bezahlbare) Option.
Auf drei der wichtigsten Anforderungen wollen wir etwas detaillierter eingehen. Dazu haben wir noch eine Anforderung in petto, die Eclipse hawkBit bewusst nicht adressiert, die aber nicht minder wichtig ist.
Schnittstellenstabilität
IoT-Geräte haben oftmals eine Lebensdauer, die von einigen Jahren im Consumer-Markt bis hin zu einigen Jahrzenten im industriellen und Automotive-Markt reichen kann. Zu berücksichtigen ist dabei, dass es durchaus Szenarien gibt, in denen vernetzte Geräte sich über lange Zeiträume gar nicht erst im Backend melden. Ein Gerät kann gefertigt sein, wandert dann jedoch für ein oder zwei Jahre ins Lager. Noch länger könnte es bei einem Gerät dauern, das bereits verkauft, installiert, aber nie connected wurde, zum Beispiel weil ein Kunde zwar eine „Cloud-ready“-Heizanlage oder einen Wechselrichter im Haus hat, aber nie dazu gekommen ist, die Internetverkabelung dorthin zu legen.
Im Ergebnis sind wir mit der Situation konfrontiert, dass ein Gerät erst nach Jahren das erste Mal auf eine Cloud treffen kann. Niemand verlangt, dass das fachliche Backend noch mit gleicher Schnittstelle existiert wie zum Fertigungszeitpunkt. Die Funktionalität „Softwareupdate“ muss aber zumindest noch funktionieren.
Schnittstellenflexibilität
Zunächst im Widerspruch zu dem Anspruch an stabile Schnittstellen müssen diese gleichermaßen flexibel sein, da im IoT bis heute kein verbreiteter Standard für die Gerätekonnektivität oder das Devicemanagement existiert. Auf Ebene des Transportprotokolls sehen wir von HTTP über MQTT, AMQP oder CoAP so ziemlich alles im Einsatz. Im Devicemanagement existieren mit OMA-DM, LWM2M oder TR-069 zwar einige Standards, in der Praxis konnte sich aber bisher keiner wirklich domänenübergreifend durchsetzen.
Die Folge ist, dass in vielen Projekten das Devicemanagement tendenziell über ein selbst entwickeltes Protokoll erledigt wird. Zudem wird üblicherweise auch nur ein Kanal verwendet, um Operationen wie das Softwareupdate auf dem Gerät und fachlichem Datentransport vom Gerät in die Cloud zu bewerkstelligen.
Funktionale Skalierbarkeit
Neben der technischen Skalierbarkeit, also der flexiblen Bereitstellung von Rechen- oder Bandbreitenkapazitäten während eines Updates, die uns heutzutage viele Cloud-Plattformen kostengünstig zur Verfügung stellen, ist es auch von elementarer Bedeutung, bei großen IoT-Projekten mit Tausenden oder gar Millionen von Geräten, den gesamtem Update-Roll-out-Prozess fachlich unter Kontrolle zu haben. Dazu gehört die Fähigkeit, die Geräte in mehrere Untergruppen zu unterteilen und den Roll-out dann Gruppe für Gruppe zum Beispiel nacheinander oder auf Basis eines Ablaufplans durchzuführen und im Fehlerfall kontrolliert abzubrechen. Des Weiteren gehört das Überwachen des Roll-outs während der Ausführung bis hin zur Auswertung nach Abschluss dazu.
Das System muss auch damit zurechtkommen, dass viele Geräte in einem Roll-out nur sehr verzögert oder nie ein Update durchführen, beispielsweise weil sie zwar registriert, aber nie online sind. In diesem Sinn ist ein Roll-out in sehr großen Szenarien wahrscheinlich nie „fertig“.

Why do we need to import an auto config within a tests? Isn't
server.servlet.encoding.enabled=true
the default?

I think this won't guarantee that the server actually uses the correct encoding if you manually add it to the test

In einem Softwareupdateprozess brauchen wir zwischen dem Gerät selbst und dem Ersteller der Software Vertrauen. Zwischen diesen beiden Instanzen steht allerdings der Softwareupdateservice; es ist nun einmal seine Aufgabe, die erstellte Software auf das Gerät zu transportieren. Im Ergebnis ist er damit auch die Stelle, die die Gefahr der Korrumpierung birgt. Er sollte als „Man-in-the-Middle“ daher niemals verpflichtet werden, die Authentizität der Softwareartefakte abschließend zu bestätigen. Er kümmert sich um die Verschlüsselung des Transports, um Authentifizierung und Autorisierung von Geräten und Benutzern, aber am Ende des Tages muss das Gerät selbst die Authentizität zum Beispiel durch eine Signatur prüfen. Daher wird die Ende-zu-Ende-Sicherheit bewusst nicht von hawkBit garantiert.

Eclipse hawkBit
Eclipse hawkBit begegnet bereits einigen dieser Herausforderungen. Die Schnittstellenstabilität zum Gerät wird durch das einfache RESTful-Direct-Device-Integration-API ermöglicht, das vom Gerät direkt aufgerufen wird und dort vollkommen auf Softwareupdate fokussiert einfach stabil gehalten werden kann. Eine hohe Flexibilität für die Geräteintegration wird alternativ durch das Device-Management-Federation-API gewährleistet, das es ermöglicht, verschiedene Gerätekonnektoren einzuklinken.
Funktionale Skalierbarkeit ist hingegen noch innerhalb der Community in Arbeit, mehr dazu im Ausblick am Ende dieses Artikels. Wie bereits angedeutet, wird Ende-zu-Ende-Sicherheit bewusst nicht von hawkBit garantiert, hier ist zusätzliche Arbeit im jeweiligen Projekt gefordert.
Neben diesen besonderen Anforderungen muss hawkBit natürlich den heute üblichen Standards genügen. Dazu gehören flexibel nutzbare Schnittstellen, eine moderne „Cloud-ready“-Softwarearchitektur und, besonders wichtig für ein Open-Source-Projekt, ein hoher Grad an Flexibilität in der Nutzung der Software in eigenen Projekten.
Integrationsszenarien
Eclipse hawkBit kann als eigenständige Applikation benutzt werden, um Softwareupdates direkt auf Geräte durchzuführen. In dieser einfachsten Variante nutzt der Administrator das hawkBit-Management-UI, um das Repository zu verwalten und die Updates durchzuführen. Geräte werden hierbei über das Direct-Device-Integration-API an den hawkBit-Server angebunden.

We had to implement a workaround for the tests here as the download Tests were failing when setting server.servlet.encoding.enabled=true for all the tests, due to a bug in MockHttpServletResponse, that will be fixed within 5.2.9. With this test, we want to ensure that charset=utf-8 is still returned in the response, because we can't test it within the other tests right now.

Eine weitergehende Integration ermöglicht das RESTful-Management-API, das featurekompatibel zum Mangement-UI ist. Mögliche Anwendungsfelder sind zum Beispiel:
Eine einfache Statusabfrage des Softwarestands eines Geräts beispielsweise für ein Supportportal
Triggern eines Updates aus einer Workflow-Engine
Betanken des Software-Repositories aus einer Continous Integration Engine mit anschließendem Update auf Testgeräte für Integrationstests
Integration aller Funktionalitäten in eine Geräteverwaltungsapplikation.
Das Device-Management-Federation-API rundet das Bild schließlich ab, da es über einen AMQP (0.9) Broker ermöglicht, Geräte indirekt über (bestehende) Konnektoren anzubinden. Werden beide Schnittstellen voll genutzt, kann hawkBit sich auf das Verwalten des Repositories und das Steuern der Updates konzentrieren.
Abb. 2: hawkBit-Integrationsmöglichkeiten
Ein Softwareupdate ist nicht nur eine Datei
Softwareupdates bestehen oftmals aus mehreren Softwarekomponenten wie Betriebssystem-, Laufzeit- und Applikationskomponenten. Diese Softwarekomponenten bestehen selbst wiederum auch meist aus mehreren Dateien, zum Beispiel dem Vollupdate, verschiedenen Binary-Deltas und Signaturen.
Eclipse hawkBit definiert ein flexibles Datenmodell, um solche komplexen Strukturen inklusive Metadaten wie Versionierung und Beschreibung zu einem Softwareupdate abbilden zu können. Auf Basis dieses Modells können Geräten mehrere Softwarepakete zugewiesen und atomar aktualisiert werden.
Abb. 3: hawkBit-Softwareupdate-Paketemodell
Eclipse hawkBit zum Ausprobieren
Der Quellcode von Eclipse
hawkBit
kann von GitHub geklont und via Maven gebaut werden (Listing 1).
Nach erfolgreichem Bauen des Quellcodes kann die mitgelieferte Beispielanwendung gestartet werden, die das Management-UI bereitstellt, um Software auf Geräte auszurollen. Die grafische Oberfläche kann über die Adresse http://localhost:8080/UI aufgerufen werden, und der Anwender kann sich mit den Credentials „Benutzer: admin“ und „Passwort: admin“ anmelden (Listing 2).
Um nicht einen eigenen Geräteclient zum Testen schreiben zu müssen, gibt es in hawkBit einen Gerätesimulator, der updatefähige Geräte simulieren und über die beiden Schnittstellen an hawkBit anbinden kann (Listing 3).

Um Geräte zu simulieren, kann die grafische Oberfläche oder alternativ das RESTful API des Simulators verwendet werden.
Unter den Beispielen ist auch ein Management-API-Client, der die Benutzung des Management-API demonstriert und auch automatisch einige Beispielsoftwarepakete erstellt, die gleich in der hawkBit-Beispielanwendung verwendbar sind.
Mittels Management-UI der hawkBit-Beispielanwendung können dann die vorgefertigten Softwarepakete auf die simulierten Geräte „ausgerollt“ werden.
Abb. 4: hawkBit: manuelles Softwareupdatebeispiel
Ausblick
Zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung dieses Artikels befindet sich das hawkBit-Projekt in Vorbereitung auf das erste Release 0.1, das die beschriebenen Basisfunktionalitäten und -schnittstellen beinhalten wird. Mit dem Release 0.2 wird die funktionale Komplettierung weiter vorangebracht, um insbesondere dem für hawkBit definierten Anspruch der funktionalen Skalierbarkeit mit der Entwicklung eines Roll-out-Managements gerecht zu werden.
Technisch ist eine weitere Verbesserung von hawkBits Anpassbarkeit, Modularisierung und Integrationsfähigkeiten angestrebt. Interessant erscheint auch die Integration mit weiteren Eclipse-IoT-Projekten wie etwa
Leshan
, um LWM2M-Geräte mit Firmware zu versorgen, Hono, um Geräte leichter an hawkBit anzubinden oder
Tiaki
, um Geräte sicher und automatisch den richtigen hawkBit-Server finden zu lassen.

Software updates in an IoT context
Eclipse hawkBit — Features, requirements, scenarios et al.
May 24, 2016

Implementing software on everything from embedded control units to more powerful gateways is a routine task in just about every IoT project. If device software can be updated, the project is presented with a range of new possibilities, not least the chance to confront the increasing number of security issues. As soon as a device is connected, it is vulnerable to a whole new line of attack – and that is something for which developers of hardware and embedded software must be prepared.
We must be conscious that, in the context of the IoT, cloud-supported updates bring with them a whole series of challenges that we are simply not familiar with from the updating of servers, PCs, or smartphones. On the plus side, from the backend perspective, software updates for the IoT are relatively independent of the specific domain, meaning that they need only be implemented once. In essence, the requirements for updating a smart home, an assembly line, or a car are the same in each case – though of course there will be a difference in the security required and the operations occurring on the device itself.

A device and software repository
Interfaces for flexible device integration
User interface and interfaces for executing software update operations and managing the repository
A modern architecture based on Spring Boot that makes it easy to adapt hawkBit to the user’s individual needs
Interface stability for long-lasting devices
Interface flexibility for device integration in the project
Functional scalability for big IoT rollouts
End-to-end security for the software update process
Note:
Eclipse hawkBit does not currently possess a ready-to-go device client, and is hoping for active collaboration from the Eclipse community.
Requirements
A device’s length of service also depends on keeping the software update mechanism stable throughout the device’s service life. This can often be a period of years or even decades. Furthermore, in contrast to PCs and smartphones, manual intervention from a device’s end user is most often not an (affordable) option in the IoT context.
We would like to take a look at three of the most important requirements in more detail. We also briefly mention a further requirement, which is no less important but which Eclipse hawkBit was not designed to address.
Interface stability
IoT devices have service lives ranging from a few years for the consumer market to a few decades in industrial and automotive contexts. We should not forget that there are scenarios in which connected devices might go for extended periods without contact with the backend. For instance, a device might be produced and then spend one or two years in a warehouse. The time periods for a device that has been bought and installed but never connected are even longer; imagine a customer who possesses a cloud-ready heating system or power inverter and yet has never got round to providing it with internet access.

Interface flexibility
Interfaces must be as flexible as they are stable, since the IoT does not possess any established standard governing device connectivity or device management. There are all sorts of transport protocols currently in use, ranging from HTTP to MQTT, AMQP, and CoAP. In terms of device management, OMA-DM, LWM2M, and TR-069 provide some degree of standardization, though in practice none has yet firmly established itself across domains. As a result, most projects tend to rely on their own protocol for device management. It is also standard practice to use just a single channel for completing operations such as updating the software on the device and transferring data from the device to the cloud.
Functional scalability
The system must also be able to cope with the fact that in a rollout many devices might install the update very late or not at all, perhaps because they are registered but never online. In this sense, it is likely that very large-scale rollouts will never be declared entirely complete.
End-to-end security
The software update process relies on trust between the device itself and the creator of the software. In between is the software update service, whose task is first and foremost to transfer software onto the device. As a result, it is also the point at which the danger of corruption arises. It should never be the duty of the software update service, as the “man in the middle,” to confirm the authenticity of a software artifact. Its job is to encrypt the transfer, and authenticate and authorize devices and users, but at the end of the day it is up to the device itself to verify software authenticity, for instance via a digital signature. That is why hawkBit deliberately gives no guarantee of end-to-end security.

Eclipse Vorto: Interoperability for the Internet of Things
Eclipse hawkBit
Eclipse hawkBit is already addressing some of these challenges. Interface stability with the device is enabled by the simple RESTful API for direct device integration, accessed directly from the device, where it focuses completely on software updates and can easily be kept stable. At the same time, the device management federation API supplies a high level of flexibility for device integration, making it possible to patch in various device connectors.
As well as these specific requirements, hawkBit must of course comply with today’s established standards. These include flexibly applicable interfaces, a modern cloud-ready software architecture, and – of particular importance for an open source project – a high degree of flexibility in using the software for in-house projects.

Eclipse hawkBit can be used as a stand-alone application for implementing software updates directly on a device. In this most basic scenario, the administrator uses the hawkBit management UI to manage the repository and execute updates. Devices are connected to the hawkBit server via the direct device integration API.
Fig. 1: hawkBit, simplest user scenario
More comprehensive integration is enabled by the RESTful management API, the features of which are compatible with the management UI. It can be used to:
Conveniently ascertain a device’s software version, perhaps for a support portal
Trigger an update from a workflow engine
Refill the software repository from a continuous integration engine, with a subsequent update on test devices for integration testing
The final element is the device management federation API, which enables the indirect connection of devices via (existing) connectors using an AMQP (0.9) broker. If both interfaces are fully occupied, hawkBit is able to concentrate on managing the repository and update process.
Fig. 2: The possibilities of hawkBit integration
A software update is more than just a file
Software updates most often consist of multiple software components, including operating system, run-time, and application components. The software components themselves also comprise multiple files, for instance the complete update, various binary deltas, and signatures.
Eclipse hawkBit defines a flexible data model that is capable of combining these complex structures, including metadata such as version and description, into a software update. The model can be used to supply devices with multiple software packages and update them in an atomic process.
Fig. 3: hawkBit software update package model
Trying out Eclipse hawkBit
The source code for Eclipse hawkBit [5] can be cloned from GitHub and installed via Maven (listing 1).
Once you have successfully installed the source code, you can launch the accompanying sample application, which makes the management UI available for rolling out software to devices.

users can log in with the following credentials: user: admin and password: admin (listing 2).
So that the user does not need to write their own device client for testing, hawkBit comes with a device simulator that is capable of simulating update-ready devices and connecting them to hawkBit via both interfaces (listing 3).
For simulating devices, users can choose from either the graphical interface or the simulator’s RESTful API.
The samples also include a management API client that demonstrates the use of the management API as well as automatically generating a few sample software packages for immediate use in the hawkBit sample application.
Using the management UI provided with the hawkBit sample application, users can then roll out the ready-made software packages onto the simulated devices.

Outlook
From a technical standpoint, we are aiming for further improvements with regard to hawkBit’s flexibility, modularity, and capacity for integration. There are also interesting possibilities for integration with other Eclipse IoT projects such as Leshan [6], so as to supply LWM2M devices with firmware, Hono, to make it easier to connect devices to hawkBit, and Tiaki [7], so devices can find the correct hawkBit server securely and automatically.
