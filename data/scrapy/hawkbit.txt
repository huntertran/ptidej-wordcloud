IoT. Update. Device.
Eclipse hawkBit™ is a domain independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates
to constrained
edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking
infrastructure.
Interfaces
hawkBit offers a direct device integration via HTTP or a device management federation API
which allows to connect devices with different protocol adapter. Users can make use of the graphical
user interface
and other service can interact with hawkBit through the RESTful management API.
Rollout
hawkBit supports an easy and flexible rollout management which allows you to update a large
amount of devices in separated groups.
Cascading start of the deployment groups based on installation status of the previous
group.
Emergency shutdown of the rollout in case a group exceeds the defined error threshold.
Rollout progress monitoring for the entire rollout and the individual groups.
Package Model
A software update does not always contain only a single file. The hawkBit meta model allows
you to configure your files in virtual software and distribution packages.

Target State Machine
A target has a current state which reflects the provisioning status of the device at this point in time. State changes are driven either by the update server by means of starting an update or by the controller on the provisioning target that gives feedback to the update server, e.g. “I am here”, “I am working on a provisioning”, “I have finished a provisioning”.
Defined states
State

What is hawkBit?
Eclipse hawkBit™ is an domain-independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking infrastructure.
Why Software Updates in IoT?
Having software update capabilities ensures a secure IoT by means that it gives IoT projects a fighting chance against pandora’s box that they opened the moment their devices got connected. From that moment on devices are at the forefront of IT security threats many embedded software developers historically never had to face. Shipping for instance a Linux powered device connected to the Internet without any security updates ever applied during its lifetime is kind of a suicidal act these days.
A more charming argument for software update is that it enables agile development for hardware and hardware near development. Concepts like a minimum viable product can be applied for devices as not all features need to be ready at manufacturing time. Changes on the cloud side of the IoT project can be applied to the devices at runtime as well.
Sometimes Software Update is a business model on its own as it makes devices much more attractive to the customer if they are updateable, i.e. they do not only buy a product because of its current feature set but make also a bet on its future capabilities. In addition new revenue streams may arise from the fact that feature extensions can potentially be monetized (e.g. Apps) without the need to design, manufacture and ship a new device (revision).
Why hawkBit?
Updating software (components) on constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways is as mentioned before a common requirement in most IoT scenarios.
At the time being, this process is usually handled by the IoT solution itself, sometimes backed by a full fledged device management system. We believe that this approach generates unnecessary duplicate work in the IoT space, in particular when considering the challenges of implementing a safe and reliable remote software update process: the software update process must never fail and also must never be compromised as, at the one hand, it can be used to fix almost any issue/problem on the device but at the same time also poses the greatest security threat if mis-used to introduce malicious code to the device.
In addition we believe the software update process to be relatively independent from particular application domains when seen from the back-end (cloud) perspective. Updating the software for an entire car may differ from updating the firmware of a single sensor with regard to the connectivity of the device to the cloud and also to the complexity of the software package update process on the device. However, the process of rolling out the software, e.g. uploading an artifact to the repository, assigning it to eligible devices, managing the roll out campaign for a large number of devices, orchestrating content delivery networks to distribute the package, monitoring and reporting the progress of the roll-out and last but not least requirements regarding security and reliability are quite similar.
Assigned Distribution Set is installed.
PENDING
Installation of assigned Distribution Set is not yet confirmed.
ERROR
Installation of assigned Distribution Set has failed.
REGISTERED
Target registered at the update server but no Distribution Set assigned. Is the initial starting point for plug-and-play devices.

Existing device management systems usually lack the capability to efficiently organize roll outs at IoT scale, e.g. splitting the roll out into sub groups, cascading them, automatically stopping the roll out after a defined error threshold etc. They are also usually restricted to a single device management protocol, either a proprietary one or one of the existing standard protocols like LWM2M, OMA-DM or TR-069. Even if they support more than one such protocol, they are often a result of the device management protocol they started with and restricted in their adoption capabilities to others.
As a result we have the need for a domain independent solution
that works for the majority of IoT projects
that goes beyond the pure update and handles more complex roll out strategies needed by large scale IoT projects.
that at the same time is focused on software updates in the IoT space
and that is able to work on its own for simple scenarios while having the capability to integrate with existing device management systems and protocols.
Cloud Ready
Technical Scalability: connect millions of devices and ship terabytes of software on a global scale.
Functional Scalability: rollouts with hundreds of thousands of individual devices in it.
Reliability: software update as the last line of defense against device faults and vulnerabilities.
Managed device complexity: device topologies inside each individual provisioning target.
Integration flexibility: connect and integrate through various (non-)standardized device management protocols directly or through federated device managements.

Release notes
Authorization
Authorization is handled separately for Direct Device Integration (DDI) API and Device Management Federation (DMF) API (where successful authentication includes full authorization) and Management API and UI which is based on Spring security authorities.
However, keep in mind that hawkBit does not offer an off the shelf authentication provider to leverage these permissions and the underlying multi user/tenant capabilities of hawkBit but it supports authentication providers offering an OpenID Connect interface. Check out Spring security documentation for further information. In hawkBit SecurityAutoConfiguration is a good starting point for integration.
The default implementation is single user/tenant with basic auth and the logged in user is provided with all permissions. Additionally, the application properties may be configured for multiple static users; see Multiple Users for details.
DDI API
An authenticated target is permitted to:
- retrieve commands from the server
- provide feedback to the the server
- download artifacts that are assigned to it
A target might be permitted to download artifacts without authentication (if enabled, see above). Only the download can be permitted to disable the authentication. This can be used in scenarios where the artifacts itself are e.g. signed and secured.
Management API and UI
Multiple Users
hawkBit optionally supports configuring multiple static users through the application properties. In this case, the user and password Spring security properties are ignored.
An example configuration is given below.
hawkbit.server.im.users[0].username=admin
Clustering
hawkBit is able to run in a cluster with some constraints. This guide provides insights in the basic concepts and how to setup your own cluster. You can find additional information in the hawkBit runtimes’s README.
Big picture
Events
Event communication between nodes is based on Spring Cloud Bus and Spring Cloud Stream. There are different binder implementations available. The hawkbit Update Server uses RabbitMQ binder. Every node gets his own queue to receive cluster events, the default payload is JSON.
If an event is thrown locally at one node, it will be automatically delivered to all other available nodes via the Spring Cloud Bus’s topic exchange:
Via the ServiceMatcher you can check whether an event happened locally at one node or on a different node.
serviceMatcher.isFromSelf(event)
Caching
Every node is maintaining its own caches independent from other nodes. So there is no globally shared/synchronized cache instance within the cluster. In order to keep nodes in sync a TTL (time to live) can be set for all caches to ensure that after some time the cache is refreshed from the database. To enable the TTL just set the property “hawkbit.cache.global.ttl” (value in milliseconds). Of course you can implement a shared cache, e.g. Redis.
See CacheAutoConfiguration
Schedulers
Every node has multiple schedulers which run after a defined period of time. All schedulers always run on every node. This has to be kept in mind e.g. if the scheduler executes critical code which has to be executed only once.
Known constraints
UI sessions
Controller_id_2,targetName2

OpenID Connect
hawkbit supports authentication providers which use the OpenID Connect standard, an authentication layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
An example configuration is given below.
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.oidc.client-id=clientID
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.oidc.client-secret=oidc-client-secret
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.oidc.issuer-uri=https://oidc-provider/issuer-uri
As of today hawkBit is not storing user sessions in a shared, cluster wide cache. Session is only bound to the node where the login took place. If this node is going down for whatever reason, the session is lost and the user is forced to login again.
In case that’s not an option, you can help yourself by introducing a shared session cache based on e.g. Redis.
Furthermore hawkBit is not supporting session stickiness out of the box either. However most of the well known load balancer out there can solve this issue.
Caching of download IDs
The downloadId is generated and stored in the DownloadIdCache. It is used for downloading an artifact.
In hawkBit exists an interface called “DownloadIdCache” and one implementation of it: “DefaultDownloadIdCache”. This default implementation can’t be used within a cluster. Its containing data is only available inside one node and can’t be shared with other nodes. E.g. the downloadId which is stored in this cache after authentication on node A can only be used for downloading the artifact by node A.
In a cluster-capable environment this fact can lead to issues as it could happen, that the downloadId is stored on node A and node B would like to download the artifact by means of the downloadId which is not available on node B. To solve this issue you can use a cluster-shared cache e.g. Redis or create a new cluster-aware implementation of the interface “DownloadIdCache”.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) filter
hawkBit owns the feature of guarding itself from DoS attacks, a DoS filter. It reduces the maximum number of requests per seconds which can be configured for read and write requests.
This mechanism is only working for every node separately, i.e. in a cluster environment the worst-case behaviour would be that the maximum number of requests per seconds will be increased to its product if every request is handled by a different node.
The same constraint exists with the validator to check if a user tried too many logins within a defined period of time.

I'm following these spring boot docs to make the env variable name, but it looks like I should have kept the dash in the name? HAWKBIT_ARTIFACT_URL_PROTOCOLS_DOWNLOAD-HTTP_REF seems to work.
To what value did you set the env variable?

@Sergey-G-dev
@schabdo We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (eclipse/hawkbit#1024). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?

Hi Team, For business requirements sake, we want to force softDelete the softwares irrespective of if it has associated distribution/used. is there any way to force softDelete on softwareModules ?
Alexander Coers
@Alexco500
Hi, I still fail to understand the =IN= parameters in filter definitions. Can someone provide an example with some explanations, please (slightly more than the one in the docs: Use =IN= for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2) :-) )? Thanks in advance.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@Sergey-G-dev Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?
That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@Alexco500 This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like "id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)". That means this condition is true if id is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator =OUT= meaning the condition is true only if the id is NOT equal to any of those in the list.
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev thanks for providing an example! @Alexco500 it is kind of similar to the IN operator known from SQL
@RajeshReddyKa_twitter I think I have not fully understood your questions. May I asked you to elaborate a bit more on that?

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl
Jalal
@jmlups_gitlab
ok i'll try that thanks @schabdo
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
@bogdan-bondar Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line: hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296and it fixed the problem.

Authentication
Gives all targets that do not have the update status In_sync or error and that contains the term SHC1 in their name.
(updatestatus!=error or updatestatus!=pending) and (name==*CCU* or description==*CCU*)
Gives all targets that either have the term ‘CCU’ in their name or their description and that either have the update status not in state error or pending.
Auto assignment
It is possible to assign some distribution set with different action types (forced, soft, or download only) to all targets that belong to the corresponding custom target filter, including the ones, that are registered later on.
In order to activate the auto-assignment, one should first click on Auto assignment cell in Custom Filters table, and then check the corresponding checkbox. After that, the action type and distribution set for auto-assignment should be selected and confirmed.
As long as the auto-assignment stays active, the scheduler will try to assign selected distribution set to corresponding custom filter targets, that have never seen it before.

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
… however I filed an issue to support you better in this kind of setup (cf. eclipse/hawkbit#1036)

@kwilcox About:
I'm following these spring boot docs to make the env variable name, but it looks like I should have kept the dash in the name? HAWKBIT_ARTIFACT_URL_PROTOCOLS_DOWNLOAD-HTTP_REF seems to work.
To what value did you set the env variable?

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo Thank you, will try it. Appreciate quick response!

welcome :+1:
RalfMengwasser
@RalfMengwasser
i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

@Sergey-G-dev
Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Bondar Bogdan
@bogdan-bondar
@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

@schabdo We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (eclipse/hawkbit#1024). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?

Hi together, does anyone know how to mount an Azure File Share to the Hawkbit Pod in AKS? I guess the only way to do it is writing an own helm chart isn't it?
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

@Sergey-G-dev
@Sergey-G-dev Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?
That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@Alexco500 This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like "id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)". That means this condition is true if id is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator =OUT= meaning the condition is true only if the id is NOT equal to any of those in the list.
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev thanks for providing an example! @Alexco500 it is kind of similar to the IN operator known from SQL
@RajeshReddyKa_twitter I think I have not fully understood your questions. May I asked you to elaborate a bit more on that?
As far as I understood you’d like to always soft delete a software module?

@Sergey-G-dev Thanks! Indeed very simple :-)

no i didnt have it running... it was looking for it and didnt find it
RalfMengwasser
@RalfMengwasser
now i get a "Caused by: org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException: Unsupported Database: MariaDB 10.5"
now why is MariaDB 10.5 not supported? where can I read up on that?
RalfMengwasser
@RalfMengwasser
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.

@mdymov-hayward
Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

@schabdo
@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl
Jalal
@jmlups_gitlab
ok i'll try that thanks @schabdo
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
@bogdan-bondar Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line: hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296and it fixed the problem.
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
But still need it application.properties file something like that:spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MBspring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MBspring.servlet.multipart.enabled=truespring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB

@BigFatDog
Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

Yes... But i observe softDelete only happens when softwareModule has distribution. Is there any alternative to always softDelete so we can preserve all softwaremodules ?

@schabdo One question regarding #1024 - after fixing the issues mentioned by the hawkbit-bot, what's the preferred way of pushing them - should I do an amend commit + force push or just another usual commit and push?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev we don’t enforce a special treatment here. It’s up to you what suits you best :+1:
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@schabdo Alright, so I've fixed the issues and pushed the changes and requested a review by hawkbit-bot, but the bot hasn't done it yet. Does it need to be triggered manually? If so, how?
_
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:

Project hawkBit aims to create a domain independent back end solution for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking infrastructure. Devices can be connected to the hawkBit server either directly through an optimized interface or indirectly through federated device management servers.
hawkBit is device and communication channel neutral by means of supporting:
Software and Operating system updates for M2M gateways (typically but not necessarily running Linux) and
Firmware updates for embedded devices
both for
cable or
over the air (OTA) connected devices

@kwilcox About:
I'm following these spring boot docs to make the env variable name, but it looks like I should have kept the dash in the name? HAWKBIT_ARTIFACT_URL_PROTOCOLS_DOWNLOAD-HTTP_REF seems to work.
To what value did you set the env variable?

Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Release notes
IoT. Update. Device.
Eclipse hawkBit™ is a domain independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates
to constrained
edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking
infrastructure.
Interfaces
hawkBit offers a direct device integration via HTTP or a device management federation API
which allows to connect devices with different protocol adapter. Users can make use of the graphical
user interface
and other service can interact with hawkBit through the RESTful management API.
Rollout
hawkBit supports an easy and flexible rollout management which allows you to update a large
amount of devices in separated groups.
Cascading start of the deployment groups based on installation status of the previous

This is an attempt to solve the issue described here: #983
Summary: whenever a target uploads its configuration over REST endpoint '.../configData' a check for Distribution Set assignment is triggered based on existing Target Filters. This makes AutoAssignmentChecker and Scheduler obsolete. The database load is reduced significantly since there is no need to execute the assignment check regularly.

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

@jmlups_gitlab
ok i'll try that thanks @schabdo

@mikhailtchernychev
@bogdan-bondar Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line: hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296and it fixed the problem.

Changes allow to bump Java source level from 8 to 11 passing all tests on JDK 11.
However I do not enforce the switch to Java 11 yet (cf. Java 11 roadmap).
Main changes:
Latest stable EclipseLink version fixing invalid JPA type serialization
Fixed compiler and JPA spec violation which is enforced since Java 9 (cf. JDK-8157181)
Fixed NPE in eclipselink-maven-plugin while parsing JPA annotations

DdiConfigData falsely extended DdiActionFeedback which forced it to add an "status" property to every request although its value was never used within code. This PR removes the unnecessary fields of DdiActionFeedback. As it is set to ignore unknown properties, old requests that contain the "status" property will still work, maintaining backwards compatibility.
All test were also adapted accordingly to not use the "status" property, it was also removed from the documentation tests. In addition a test was added to ensure backwards compatibility is not broken by checking if a request with the "status" property still works as before.

Thanks a lot for your contribution! I have one remark though: "This makes AutoAssignmentChecker and Scheduler obsolete", not really. Target Filter isn't scoped to Target attributes only, this involves Target name, metadata, description, etc. as well. So as an example: if new Target matching the Filter (say by name) comes online and being registered in Hawkbit per plug-and-play mechanism it should receive the DS assignment irregardless of whether it sends attributes or not.
But still need it application.properties file something like that:spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MBspring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MBspring.servlet.multipart.enabled=truespring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB

Hi together, does anyone know how to mount an Azure File Share to the Hawkbit Pod in AKS? I guess the only way to do it is writing an own helm chart isn't it?
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

You are correct, @bogdan-bondar . My choice of words wasn't very precise. By "attributes" I meant not only the actual attributes, but all the relevant fields as defined in the class TargetFields.java, since those are used by the filters. Still, I don't see how the AutoAssignmentScheduler/Checker is usefull after this change, because it does exactly the same thing, just at a scheduled time interval.

now i get a "Caused by: org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException: Unsupported Database: MariaDB 10.5"
now why is MariaDB 10.5 not supported? where can I read up on that?

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

When an action is on canceling mode it is currently possible to override that status if DDI or DMF provide intermediate feedback (either for the cancelation itself or the original update).
In that case the action switches back from canceling to running or one of the other status.
This is wrong of course. The action has to stay on cancelling until the cancel operation is confirmed or rejected or the original update completes.

Refactoring:
Provide interface on top of *management implementations.
Make entities immutable and create proper update methods that state by signature what can be updated.
Introduce builder pattern for EntityFactory create methods and repository update methods.
Use IDs in signatures for searches, not complete entities
Consistent usage of Java 8 Optional in the interfaces (Repo shall never return null!)
Remove TargetInfo interfaces as this does not belong into the API. The very existence of this object is very Spring Data/JPA specific.
Consistent usage of paging (make sure that we never query everything)
Fix DMF model name clashes by means of renaming DMF model in similar pattern to the other APIs.

Release notes
Device Management Federation API
The DMF API provides Java classes which allows that the message body can be deserialized at runtime into a Java object. Also Java classes can be used to serialize Java objects into JSON bodies to send a message to hawkBit.
Currently, bodies of messages are based on JSON.
Basics
There are three basic concepts of AMQP:
Exchanges - what you publish to.
Queues - what you consume from.
Bindings - configuration that maps an exchange to a queue.
Queues are just a place for receiving messages.
Bindings determine how messages get put in this place
Queues can also be bound to multiple exchanges.
Exchanges are just publish messages.

Hi all guys. Our team needs PostgreSQL support for Hawkbit and here is an alpha version of it. It is not yet well-tested but it seems hawkbit runs smoothly. I will improve it until it is ready to be merged. BTW I'm very bad at Java and will appreciate all of your remarks and help :)
Here are steps to run it:
mvn clean install -DskipTests && cp hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server/target/hawkbit-update-server-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar hawkbit-runtime/docker/dev/hawkbit-update-server.jar && docker build hawkbit-runtime/docker/dev -f hawkbit-runtime/docker/dev/Dockerfile --tag hawkbit/hawkbit-update-server:dev && docker build hawkbit-runtime/docker/dev-postgresql/ -f hawkbit-runtime/docker/dev-postgresql/Dockerfile --tag hawkbit/hawkbit-update-server:dev-postgresql && docker-compose -f hawkbit-runtime/docker/docker-compose-pg.yml up

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to hawkBit! We really appreciate this. Make yourself comfortable while I'm looking for a committer to help you with your contribution.
Quickstart
Despite the rauc-hawkbit client is primarily meant to be used as a library,
it also provides a simple example application that allows you to instantly
start with a small configuration file.
To quickly build and start a hawkBit server, follow
this
instruction.
Then setup your configuration file:
[client]
hawkbit_server = 127.0.0.1:8080
ssl = false
tenant_id = DEFAULT
target_name = test-target
auth_token = bhVahL1Il1shie2aj2poojeChee6ahShu
mac_address = 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
bundle_download_location = /tmp/bundle.raucb
Finally start the client application:
Example projects that show how hawkBit can be customized or hawkBit compatible APIs leveraged.
API client examples
hawkbit-example-ddi-feign-client : Example client based on the feign project for hawkBit's Direct Device Integration API.
hawkbit-example-mgmt-feign-client : Example client based on the feign project for hawkBit's Management API
Simulators
hawkbit-device-simulator : Simulates device software updates, leveraging the hawkBit device integration options.
hawkbit-example-mgmt-simulator : Example client simulation for the hawkBit Management API based on Spring Boot and the hawkbit-example-mgmt-feign-client.
Customization examples
hawkbit-custom-theme-example : Example for a customized theme for Management UI.

The user decides who can produce on an exchange and who can create bindings on that exchange for delivery to a specific queue.
hawkBit will create all necessary queues, exchanges and bindings for the user, making it easy to get started.
The exchange name for outgoing messages is dmf.exchange.
The user has to set a reply_to header (see chapter below), in order to specify the exchange to which hawkBit should reply to.
The following chapter describes the message body, header and properties.
Note: the DMF protocol was intended to be compatible to other use cases by design. As a result, DMF uses the term thing and not target but they are actually synonyms in this case.
Messages sent to hawkBit (Client -> hawkBit)

After rebasing this branch on top of the current master, CircleCI complains about 2 failed Unit/Integration tests, but the log messages make no sense to me:
[ERROR] ControllerManagementTest.controllerReportsActionFinishedForDownloadOnlyActionThatIsNotActive Did not receive the expected amount of events form class org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.event.remote.entity.TargetUpdatedEvent Expected: 3 but was: 3
[ERROR] ControllerManagementTest.updateTargetAttributesWithDifferentUpdateModes Did not receive the expected amount of events form class org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.event.remote.entity.TargetCreatedEvent Expected: 1 but was: 1
Running the build on my local machine works fine with all tests passing. Any ideas?

Background
Work on the RAUC hawkBit client started at Pengutronix in the middle of 2016 as part of a customer's project
and for demonstration purposes. In May 2017 the decision was made to restructure
and clean up the code and publish it as Open Source software.
Example Usage
The RaucDBUSDDIClient class from the rauc_hawkbit module allows you to
simply setup an interface between RAUC and hawkBit.
from rauc_hawkbit.rauc_dbus_ddi_client import RaucDBUSDDIClient
...
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
client = RaucDBUSDDIClient(session, HOST, SSL, TENANT_ID, TARGET_NAME,
AUTH_TOKEN, ATTRIBUTES, BUNDLE_DL_LOCATION,

When setting the log level to 'debug' the RAUC hawkBit client will print API

Glad to hear that you're actively using hawkBit even backed by a PostgreSQL database. I wrapped my head around your PR although I have no deep knowledge about PostgreSQL itself. But we'll get this done together :)
Your PR actually looks pretty good. I'd rather integrate PostgreSQL exactly like it is done for SQL-Server (see here). This simplifies configuration, docker setup and could be used locally (without Docker) as well.
<dependency>
<groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
<artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
</dependency>
Just add this to the pom.xml of the hawkbit-update-server near the SQL-Server driver dependency. So we don't need to add the driver later on in the Dockerfile.
Furthermore I totally understand the reason for using a "dev" docker tag since there is no hawkBit release available yet containing the required PostgreSQL setup. However I would avoid having a tag referring a locally build version. We better introduce a temporarily used dockerfile for 0.3.0M6 packaged with config properties (instead of the profile) and driver. As soon as there will be 0.3.0M7 available (containing PostgreSQL driver + config) we'll use hawkbit/hawkbit-update-server:0.3.0M7 as base image for the PostgreSQL image of hawkBit. Having this said I'll provide an example how I think it could work ...

* Fixed handling of action cancellation status updates.
Signed-off-by: kaizimmerm <kai.zimmermann@bosch-si.com>
* added SessionFixationProtectionStrategy for additional protection of UI session authentication
* added VaadinSessionClosingLogoutHandler to logout from all UI sessions
* added AccessDecisionManager to UI security configuration in order to support method security in UI in context of VaadinSharedSecurity
* Changed UI push transport from WEBSOCKET to WEBSOCKET_XHR to solve problems with Spring Security Context
* Suppressed atmosphere IOUtils false-positive warning
* Removed obsolete AsyncVaadinServletConfiguration
* Defined Vaadin4SpringServlet bean instead of plain SpringVaadinServlet for configuration flexibility
* Removed obsolete SpringSecurityAtmosphereInterceptor because the client does not communicate with the server using websocket protocol anymore
* Removed unit test for SpringSecurityAtmosphereInterceptor
* Removed obsolete AuthenticationManagerConfigurer coming from Vaadin Managed Security in InMemoryUserManagementAutoConfiguration
* Removed SessionFixationProtectionStrategy and VaadinSessionClosingLogoutHandler because all wrapper sessions are invalidated when the session managed by Spring gets invalidated together with configured HttpSessionEventPublisher events
* Added call to close the current session before logout redirect
* added comment why we used WEBSOCKET_XHR instead of WEBSOCKET

This PR fixes the quota checks for uploads. It moves the quota check to be executed after the upload. This enables to consider the file size within the check and show a proper error message.
Before the quota was only successfully checked when it was already exceeded before.

Examples and Extensions
Next to the hawkBit core hosted here the project maintains as well examples and extension repositories.
hawkBit sandbox
We offer a sandbox installation that is free for everyone to try out hawkBit. However, keep in mind that the sandbox database will be reset from time to time. It is also not possible to upload any artifacts into the sandbox. But you can use it to try out the Management UI, Management API and DDI API. Keep in mind as well that you are not permitted to store any kind of personal data in the sandbox.
https://hawkbit.eclipse.org
In addition the following vendors offer free trial accounts for their hawkBit compatible products:
Bosch IoT Rollouts
Kynetics Update Factory
Device Integration
hawkBit does not provide off the shelf clients for devices as part of the project. The long term goal is to provide an Eclipse hono integration which will provide connectivity through various IoT protocols and as a result allows a wide range of clients to connect to hawkBit. However, the hawkBit Direct Device Integration (API) API is HTTP/JSon based which should allow any update client to integrate quite easily.
There are clients outside of the Eclipse IoT eco system as well, e.g.:
SWupdate which is a Linux Update agent with focus on a efficient and safe way to update embedded systems.
rauc-hawkbit which is a python-based hawkBit client application and library for the RAUC update framework.

Our rule set can be found here with navigating to the tab "Quality Profiles", selecting "hawkBit", and then selecting "Actions" - "Back up"
Utility library usage
hawkBit has currently both guava and Apache commons lang on the classpath in several of its modules. However, we see introducing too many utility libraries problematic as we force these as transitive dependencies on hawkBit users. We in fact are looking into reducing them in future not adding new ones.
So we kindly ask contributors:
not introduce extra utility library dependencies
keep them out of the core modules (e.g. hawkbit-core, hawkbit-rest-core, hawkbit-http-security) to avoid that all modules have them as transitive dependency
use Spring utility classes if feasible
use guava if feasible
use Apache commons lang if feasible
Examples:
Prefer Arrays.asList(...) from JDK over guava's Lists.newArrayList(...)
Prefer StringUtils from Spring over guava's Strings Apache's StringUtils
Test documentation
content_type=application/json
Payload Template:
{
"attributes": {
"exampleKey1" : "exampleValue1",
"exampleKey2" : "exampleValue2"
},
"mode": "String"
}
The “mode” property specifies the update mode that should be applied. This property is optional. Possible mode values:
Value
Description
MERGE
The target attributes specified in the payload are merged into the existing attributes. This is the default mode that is applied if no “mode” property is specified in the payload.
REPLACE
The existing attributes are replaced with the target attributes specified in the payload.

Thank you so much @schabdo for your review. I'm not sure if I've done everything right from the first try, please do not hesitate to guide me further. Your ecosystem is terra incognita for me, so I can get stuck with the basic things. Thank you for your help again :)

To improve traceability of created actions, it should be possible to track who triggered an action (directly or indirectly).
This PR adds a new field to the Action entity that corresponds to the user who initiated/triggered an assignment, via manual/auto assignment or via a Rollout.

Status and API stability
hawkBit is currently in '0.X' semantic version. That is due to the need that there is still content in hawkBit that is in need for refactoring. That includes the maven module structure, Spring Boot Properties, Spring Boot auto configuration as well as internal Java APIs (e.g. the repository API ).
However, the device facing DDI API is on major version 'v1' and will be kept stable.
Server facing and DMF API are Management API are on v1 as well. However, we cannot fully guarantee the same stability during hawkBit's 0.X development but we will try as best we can.

Eclipse hawkBit ist ein Projekt der Eclipse IoT Working Group, die eine offene Plattform für das Internet der Dinge schaffen will. Ziel des hawkBit-Projekts ist es, ein Framework bereitzustellen, das es einfach möglich macht, die Funktionalität „Softwareupdate“ in eine IoT-Lösung oder -Plattform zu bringen.
Das Ausrollen von Software auf Embedded-Steuergeräte bis hin zu mächtigeren Gateways ist eine typische Anforderung, die uns in den meisten IoT-Projekten begegnet. Softwareupdates für Geräte abbilden zu können, eröffnet dem jeweiligen Projekt eine Reihe neuer Möglichkeiten: Zunächst einmal einen Weg, um der zunehmenden Anzahl von Sicherheitsproblemen zu begegnen. Sobald ein Gerät „connected“ ist, bietet sich eine komplett neue Angriffsfläche, auf die Embedded-Software- und Hardwareentwickler nun vorbereitet sein müssen.
Erfreulicher ist die Möglichkeit, mit Softwareupdate den Embedded-Software-Entwicklern ein agiles Entwicklungsmodell zu ermöglichen, das nicht mehr verlangt, alle Funktionen des Geräts zum Fertigungszeitpunkt der Hardware komplett ausimplementiert haben zu müssen.
Hier und dort ist Softwareupdate per se auch ein Geschäftsmodell. Es kann ein Produkt für den Konsumenten deutlich attraktiver machen, da er es nicht nur mit einem Umfang X kauft, sondern mit dem Versprechen auf die zukünftige Entwicklung des Produkts. Bei Smartphones oder PCs ist das schon lange selbstverständlich. In traditionellen Branchen, für die das IoT jetzt spannend wird, bisher weniger. Tesla ist ein Beispiel für die Vermarktung des Softwareupdates als Produktfeature aus einer Branche, in der bisher nur wenig „connected“ war. Zusätzlich kann auch das Verkaufen von nachgelieferten Funktionen („Apps“) ein interessantes Geschäftsmodell in den neuen IoT-Domänen sein.
Wir müssen dabei beachten, dass Cloud-gestützte Softwareupdates im IoT-Kontext eine ganze Reihe Herausforderungen mit sich bringen, die wir aus dem Aktualisieren von Servern, PCs oder Smartphones so nicht kennen. Positiv steht dem gegenüber, dass Softwareupdate als Funktion im IoT aus Backend-Sicht relativ unabhängig von der konkreten Domäne ist und daher auch nur einmal implementiert werden muss. Das Aktualisieren eines „Smart Homes“, einer Fertigungsstraße oder eines Fahrzeugs bringt im Kern die gleichen Anforderungen mit sich, unterscheidet sich aber sicherlich zum Beispiel hinsichtlich der Sicherheitsanforderungen und natürlich bei dem, was auf dem Gerät selbst passiert.
Eclipse hawkBit wurde als Projekt gestartet, um genau diesen domänenunabhängigen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden. Dazu stellt hawkBit eine Reihe Fähigkeiten bereit:
Ein Geräte- und Software-Repository
Schnittstellen zur flexiblen Geräteintegration
Benutzeroberfläche und Schnittstellen zum Durchführen der Softwareupdateoperationen und dem Verwalten des Repositories
Eine moderne, auf Spring Boot basierende Architektur, die es einfach ermöglicht, hawkBit an die eigenen Bedürfnisse anzupassen
Nicht funktional geht es dazu noch um:

Does it make sense to define the "SearchAwareFilterParams" or something similar, because search text belongs not only to DS, what is your opinion?

Schnittstellenflexibilität für die Geräteintegration im Projekt
Funktionale Skalierbarkeit für große Roll-outs im IoT-Kontext
Ende-zu-Ende-Sicherheit im Softwareupdateprozess
Eclipse hawkBit bringt bisher allerdings keine fertigen Geräteclients mit. Hier hofft das Projekt auf die aktive Mitarbeit der Community.
Die Anforderungen
Kommen wir nun zu den Spezialitäten bei den Anforderungen. Sie hängen stark mit der einfachen Wahrheit zusammen, dass der Softwareupdateprozess der eine Prozess ist, der niemals versagen darf. Er kann die größte Rettung für ein IoT-System sein, da mit einem erfolgreichen Update fast jedes Problem auf dem Gerät behoben werden kann. Schnittstellen in die Cloud können zudem angepasst und erweitert werden, um zu dortigen Änderungen kompatibel zu bleiben. Auf der anderen Seite ist das Update aber auch das größte Risiko für das Gerät, da damit praktisch jeder Sicherheitsmechanismus ausgehebelt werden kann.
Auch hängt die Überlebensfähigkeit des Geräts davon ab, dass der Softwareupdatemechanismus stabil über die Lebensdauer des Geräts funktioniert. Dies sind oftmals Jahre oder gar Jahrzehnte. Auch ist das manuelle Eingreifen eines Gerätebenutzers im IoT-Kontext, anders als bei PC und Smarthone, oftmals keine (bezahlbare) Option.
Auf drei der wichtigsten Anforderungen wollen wir etwas detaillierter eingehen. Dazu haben wir noch eine Anforderung in petto, die Eclipse hawkBit bewusst nicht adressiert, die aber nicht minder wichtig ist.
Schnittstellenstabilität
IoT-Geräte haben oftmals eine Lebensdauer, die von einigen Jahren im Consumer-Markt bis hin zu einigen Jahrzenten im industriellen und Automotive-Markt reichen kann. Zu berücksichtigen ist dabei, dass es durchaus Szenarien gibt, in denen vernetzte Geräte sich über lange Zeiträume gar nicht erst im Backend melden. Ein Gerät kann gefertigt sein, wandert dann jedoch für ein oder zwei Jahre ins Lager. Noch länger könnte es bei einem Gerät dauern, das bereits verkauft, installiert, aber nie connected wurde, zum Beispiel weil ein Kunde zwar eine „Cloud-ready“-Heizanlage oder einen Wechselrichter im Haus hat, aber nie dazu gekommen ist, die Internetverkabelung dorthin zu legen.
Im Ergebnis sind wir mit der Situation konfrontiert, dass ein Gerät erst nach Jahren das erste Mal auf eine Cloud treffen kann. Niemand verlangt, dass das fachliche Backend noch mit gleicher Schnittstelle existiert wie zum Fertigungszeitpunkt. Die Funktionalität „Softwareupdate“ muss aber zumindest noch funktionieren.
Schnittstellenflexibilität
Zunächst im Widerspruch zu dem Anspruch an stabile Schnittstellen müssen diese gleichermaßen flexibel sein, da im IoT bis heute kein verbreiteter Standard für die Gerätekonnektivität oder das Devicemanagement existiert. Auf Ebene des Transportprotokolls sehen wir von HTTP über MQTT, AMQP oder CoAP so ziemlich alles im Einsatz. Im Devicemanagement existieren mit OMA-DM, LWM2M oder TR-069 zwar einige Standards, in der Praxis konnte sich aber bisher keiner wirklich domänenübergreifend durchsetzen.
Die Folge ist, dass in vielen Projekten das Devicemanagement tendenziell über ein selbst entwickeltes Protokoll erledigt wird. Zudem wird üblicherweise auch nur ein Kanal verwendet, um Operationen wie das Softwareupdate auf dem Gerät und fachlichem Datentransport vom Gerät in die Cloud zu bewerkstelligen.

Neben der technischen Skalierbarkeit, also der flexiblen Bereitstellung von Rechen- oder Bandbreitenkapazitäten während eines Updates, die uns heutzutage viele Cloud-Plattformen kostengünstig zur Verfügung stellen, ist es auch von elementarer Bedeutung, bei großen IoT-Projekten mit Tausenden oder gar Millionen von Geräten, den gesamtem Update-Roll-out-Prozess fachlich unter Kontrolle zu haben. Dazu gehört die Fähigkeit, die Geräte in mehrere Untergruppen zu unterteilen und den Roll-out dann Gruppe für Gruppe zum Beispiel nacheinander oder auf Basis eines Ablaufplans durchzuführen und im Fehlerfall kontrolliert abzubrechen. Des Weiteren gehört das Überwachen des Roll-outs während der Ausführung bis hin zur Auswertung nach Abschluss dazu.
Das System muss auch damit zurechtkommen, dass viele Geräte in einem Roll-out nur sehr verzögert oder nie ein Update durchführen, beispielsweise weil sie zwar registriert, aber nie online sind. In diesem Sinn ist ein Roll-out in sehr großen Szenarien wahrscheinlich nie „fertig“.
Ende-zu-Ende-Sicherheit
In einem Softwareupdateprozess brauchen wir zwischen dem Gerät selbst und dem Ersteller der Software Vertrauen. Zwischen diesen beiden Instanzen steht allerdings der Softwareupdateservice; es ist nun einmal seine Aufgabe, die erstellte Software auf das Gerät zu transportieren. Im Ergebnis ist er damit auch die Stelle, die die Gefahr der Korrumpierung birgt. Er sollte als „Man-in-the-Middle“ daher niemals verpflichtet werden, die Authentizität der Softwareartefakte abschließend zu bestätigen. Er kümmert sich um die Verschlüsselung des Transports, um Authentifizierung und Autorisierung von Geräten und Benutzern, aber am Ende des Tages muss das Gerät selbst die Authentizität zum Beispiel durch eine Signatur prüfen. Daher wird die Ende-zu-Ende-Sicherheit bewusst nicht von hawkBit garantiert.

Eclipse hawkBit
Eclipse hawkBit begegnet bereits einigen dieser Herausforderungen. Die Schnittstellenstabilität zum Gerät wird durch das einfache RESTful-Direct-Device-Integration-API ermöglicht, das vom Gerät direkt aufgerufen wird und dort vollkommen auf Softwareupdate fokussiert einfach stabil gehalten werden kann. Eine hohe Flexibilität für die Geräteintegration wird alternativ durch das Device-Management-Federation-API gewährleistet, das es ermöglicht, verschiedene Gerätekonnektoren einzuklinken.
Funktionale Skalierbarkeit ist hingegen noch innerhalb der Community in Arbeit, mehr dazu im Ausblick am Ende dieses Artikels. Wie bereits angedeutet, wird Ende-zu-Ende-Sicherheit bewusst nicht von hawkBit garantiert, hier ist zusätzliche Arbeit im jeweiligen Projekt gefordert.
Neben diesen besonderen Anforderungen muss hawkBit natürlich den heute üblichen Standards genügen. Dazu gehören flexibel nutzbare Schnittstellen, eine moderne „Cloud-ready“-Softwarearchitektur und, besonders wichtig für ein Open-Source-Projekt, ein hoher Grad an Flexibilität in der Nutzung der Software in eigenen Projekten.
Integrationsszenarien
Eclipse hawkBit kann als eigenständige Applikation benutzt werden, um Softwareupdates direkt auf Geräte durchzuführen. In dieser einfachsten Variante nutzt der Administrator das hawkBit-Management-UI, um das Repository zu verwalten und die Updates durchzuführen. Geräte werden hierbei über das Direct-Device-Integration-API an den hawkBit-Server angebunden.

Hint: No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.

we can get rid of the @Query annotation and use the Jpa support for Entities:
long countBySha1HashAndTenantAndSoftwareModuleDeletedIsFalse(@Param("sha1") String sha1, @Param("tenant") String tenant);
We can later just check the count if greater than 1

Eclipse hawkBit — Features, requirements, scenarios et al.
May 24, 2016
Michael Hirsch and Kai Zimmermann
##eclipse
Total solar eclipse image via Shutterstock
Implementing software on everything from embedded control units to more powerful gateways is a routine task in just about every IoT project. If device software can be updated, the project is presented with a range of new possibilities, not least the chance to confront the increasing number of security issues. As soon as a device is connected, it is vulnerable to a whole new line of attack – and that is something for which developers of hardware and embedded software must be prepared.
We must be conscious that, in the context of the IoT, cloud-supported updates bring with them a whole series of challenges that we are simply not familiar with from the updating of servers, PCs, or smartphones. On the plus side, from the backend perspective, software updates for the IoT are relatively independent of the specific domain, meaning that they need only be implemented once. In essence, the requirements for updating a smart home, an assembly line, or a car are the same in each case – though of course there will be a difference in the security required and the operations occurring on the device itself.
SEE ALSO: A simple way to look at Eclipse IoT
Eclipse hawkBit was launched to provide a solution to these exact non-domain-specific requirements. To this end, hawkBit provides a range of features:
A device and software repository
Interfaces for flexible device integration
User interface and interfaces for executing software update operations and managing the repository
A modern architecture based on Spring Boot that makes it easy to adapt hawkBit to the user’s individual needs

Abb. 1: hawkBit, einfachste Variante zur Benutzung
Eine weitergehende Integration ermöglicht das RESTful-Management-API, das featurekompatibel zum Mangement-UI ist. Mögliche Anwendungsfelder sind zum Beispiel:
Eine einfache Statusabfrage des Softwarestands eines Geräts beispielsweise für ein Supportportal
Triggern eines Updates aus einer Workflow-Engine
Betanken des Software-Repositories aus einer Continous Integration Engine mit anschließendem Update auf Testgeräte für Integrationstests
Integration aller Funktionalitäten in eine Geräteverwaltungsapplikation.
Das Device-Management-Federation-API rundet das Bild schließlich ab, da es über einen AMQP (0.9) Broker ermöglicht, Geräte indirekt über (bestehende) Konnektoren anzubinden. Werden beide Schnittstellen voll genutzt, kann hawkBit sich auf das Verwalten des Repositories und das Steuern der Updates konzentrieren.
Abb. 2: hawkBit-Integrationsmöglichkeiten
Ein Softwareupdate ist nicht nur eine Datei
Softwareupdates bestehen oftmals aus mehreren Softwarekomponenten wie Betriebssystem-, Laufzeit- und Applikationskomponenten. Diese Softwarekomponenten bestehen selbst wiederum auch meist aus mehreren Dateien, zum Beispiel dem Vollupdate, verschiedenen Binary-Deltas und Signaturen.
Eclipse hawkBit definiert ein flexibles Datenmodell, um solche komplexen Strukturen inklusive Metadaten wie Versionierung und Beschreibung zu einem Softwareupdate abbilden zu können. Auf Basis dieses Modells können Geräten mehrere Softwarepakete zugewiesen und atomar aktualisiert werden.
Abb. 3: hawkBit-Softwareupdate-Paketemodell
Eclipse hawkBit zum Ausprobieren
Der Quellcode von Eclipse hawkBit kann von GitHub geklont und via Maven gebaut werden (Listing 1).
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit.git
$ mvn clean install
Nach erfolgreichem Bauen des Quellcodes kann die mitgelieferte Beispielanwendung gestartet werden, die das Management-UI bereitstellt, um Software auf Geräte auszurollen. Die grafische Oberfläche kann über die Adresse http://localhost:8080/UI aufgerufen werden, und der Anwender kann sich mit den Credentials „Benutzer: admin“ und „Passwort: admin“ anmelden (Listing 2).

Interface stability for long-lasting devices
Interface flexibility for device integration in the project
Functional scalability for big IoT rollouts
End-to-end security for the software update process
Note: Eclipse hawkBit does not currently possess a ready-to-go device client, and is hoping for active collaboration from the Eclipse community.
Requirements
A device’s length of service also depends on keeping the software update mechanism stable throughout the device’s service life. This can often be a period of years or even decades. Furthermore, in contrast to PCs and smartphones, manual intervention from a device’s end user is most often not an (affordable) option in the IoT context.
We would like to take a look at three of the most important requirements in more detail. We also briefly mention a further requirement, which is no less important but which Eclipse hawkBit was not designed to address.
Interface stability
IoT devices have service lives ranging from a few years for the consumer market to a few decades in industrial and automotive contexts. We should not forget that there are scenarios in which connected devices might go for extended periods without contact with the backend. For instance, a device might be produced and then spend one or two years in a warehouse. The time periods for a device that has been bought and installed but never connected are even longer; imagine a customer who possesses a cloud-ready heating system or power inverter and yet has never got round to providing it with internet access.
Interface flexibility
Interfaces must be as flexible as they are stable, since the IoT does not possess any established standard governing device connectivity or device management. There are all sorts of transport protocols currently in use, ranging from HTTP to MQTT, AMQP, and CoAP. In terms of device management, OMA-DM, LWM2M, and TR-069 provide some degree of standardization, though in practice none has yet firmly established itself across domains. As a result, most projects tend to rely on their own protocol for device management. It is also standard practice to use just a single channel for completing operations such as updating the software on the device and transferring data from the device to the cloud.

$ java –jar ./ examples/hawkbit-example-app/target/hawkbit-example-app-#version#.jar
Um nicht einen eigenen Geräteclient zum Testen schreiben zu müssen, gibt es in hawkBit einen Gerätesimulator, der updatefähige Geräte simulieren und über die beiden Schnittstellen an hawkBit anbinden kann (Listing 3).
$ java –jar ./ examples/hawkbit-device-simulator/target/hawkbit-device-simulator-#version#.jar
Um Geräte zu simulieren, kann die grafische Oberfläche oder alternativ das RESTful API des Simulators verwendet werden.
$ curl http://localhost:8083/start?amount=10&api=ddi
Unter den Beispielen ist auch ein Management-API-Client, der die Benutzung des Management-API demonstriert und auch automatisch einige Beispielsoftwarepakete erstellt, die gleich in der hawkBit-Beispielanwendung verwendbar sind.
$ java –jar ./ examples/hawkbit-mgmt-api-client/target/hawkbit-mgmt-api-client-#version#.jar
Mittels Management-UI der hawkBit-Beispielanwendung können dann die vorgefertigten Softwarepakete auf die simulierten Geräte „ausgerollt“ werden.
Abb. 4: hawkBit: manuelles Softwareupdatebeispiel
Ausblick
Zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung dieses Artikels befindet sich das hawkBit-Projekt in Vorbereitung auf das erste Release 0.1, das die beschriebenen Basisfunktionalitäten und -schnittstellen beinhalten wird. Mit dem Release 0.2 wird die funktionale Komplettierung weiter vorangebracht, um insbesondere dem für hawkBit definierten Anspruch der funktionalen Skalierbarkeit mit der Entwicklung eines Roll-out-Managements gerecht zu werden.
Technisch ist eine weitere Verbesserung von hawkBits Anpassbarkeit, Modularisierung und Integrationsfähigkeiten angestrebt. Interessant erscheint auch die Integration mit weiteren Eclipse-IoT-Projekten wie etwa Leshan, um LWM2M-Geräte mit Firmware zu versorgen, Hono, um Geräte leichter an hawkBit anzubinden oder Tiaki, um Geräte sicher und automatisch den richtigen hawkBit-Server finden zu lassen.

The system must also be able to cope with the fact that in a rollout many devices might install the update very late or not at all, perhaps because they are registered but never online. In this sense, it is likely that very large-scale rollouts will never be declared entirely complete.
End-to-end security
The software update process relies on trust between the device itself and the creator of the software. In between is the software update service, whose task is first and foremost to transfer software onto the device. As a result, it is also the point at which the danger of corruption arises. It should never be the duty of the software update service, as the “man in the middle,” to confirm the authenticity of a software artifact. Its job is to encrypt the transfer, and authenticate and authorize devices and users, but at the end of the day it is up to the device itself to verify software authenticity, for instance via a digital signature. That is why hawkBit deliberately gives no guarantee of end-to-end security.
SEE ALSO: Eclipse Vorto: Interoperability for the Internet of Things
Eclipse hawkBit
Eclipse hawkBit is already addressing some of these challenges. Interface stability with the device is enabled by the simple RESTful API for direct device integration, accessed directly from the device, where it focuses completely on software updates and can easily be kept stable. At the same time, the device management federation API supplies a high level of flexibility for device integration, making it possible to patch in various device connectors.
As well as these specific requirements, hawkBit must of course comply with today’s established standards. These include flexibly applicable interfaces, a modern cloud-ready software architecture, and – of particular importance for an open source project – a high degree of flexibility in using the software for in-house projects.
Integration scenarios
Eclipse hawkBit can be used as a stand-alone application for implementing software updates directly on a device. In this most basic scenario, the administrator uses the hawkBit management UI to manage the repository and execute updates. Devices are connected to the hawkBit server via the direct device integration API.
Fig. 1: hawkBit, simplest user scenario
More comprehensive integration is enabled by the RESTful management API, the features of which are compatible with the management UI. It can be used to:
Conveniently ascertain a device’s software version, perhaps for a support portal
Trigger an update from a workflow engine
Refill the software repository from a continuous integration engine, with a subsequent update on test devices for integration testing

Sorry, I should have told how to reproduce it in the first place. But I'm glad to see that you already fixed it. Thanks! Haven't found any further issues so we're good to go for master. However I have to do some Eclipse Foundation paperwork for the driver but this shouldn't take too long

The final element is the device management federation API, which enables the indirect connection of devices via (existing) connectors using an AMQP (0.9) broker. If both interfaces are fully occupied, hawkBit is able to concentrate on managing the repository and update process.
Fig. 2: The possibilities of hawkBit integration
A software update is more than just a file
Software updates most often consist of multiple software components, including operating system, run-time, and application components. The software components themselves also comprise multiple files, for instance the complete update, various binary deltas, and signatures.
Eclipse hawkBit defines a flexible data model that is capable of combining these complex structures, including metadata such as version and description, into a software update. The model can be used to supply devices with multiple software packages and update them in an atomic process.
Fig. 3: hawkBit software update package model
Trying out Eclipse hawkBit
The source code for Eclipse hawkBit [5] can be cloned from GitHub and installed via Maven (listing 1).
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit.git
$ mvn clean install
Once you have successfully installed the source code, you can launch the accompanying sample application, which makes the management UI available for rolling out software to devices.
The graphical interface can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/UI; users can log in with the following credentials: user: admin and password: admin (listing 2).
$ java –jar ./ examples/hawkbit-example-app/target/hawkbit-example-app-#version#.jar
So that the user does not need to write their own device client for testing, hawkBit comes with a device simulator that is capable of simulating update-ready devices and connecting them to hawkBit via both interfaces (listing 3).

$ java –jar ./ examples/hawkbit-device-simulator/target/hawkbit-device-simulator-#version#.jar
For simulating devices, users can choose from either the graphical interface or the simulator’s RESTful API.
$ curl http://localhost:8083/start?amount=10&api=ddi
The samples also include a management API client that demonstrates the use of the management API as well as automatically generating a few sample software packages for immediate use in the hawkBit sample application.
$ java –jar ./ examples/hawkbit-mgmt-api-client/target/hawkbit-mgmt-api-client-#version#.jar
Using the management UI provided with the hawkBit sample application, users can then roll out the ready-made software packages onto the simulated devices.

Outlook
From a technical standpoint, we are aiming for further improvements with regard to hawkBit’s flexibility, modularity, and capacity for integration. There are also interesting possibilities for integration with other Eclipse IoT projects such as Leshan [6], so as to supply LWM2M devices with firmware, Hono, to make it easier to connect devices to hawkBit, and Tiaki [7], so devices can find the correct hawkBit server securely and automatically.

@Antiarchitect I think you can remove the "draft version" from the PR title. What do you think?

remove the throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, not thrown in this context.
Could you please also double check in the whole file, there are many redundant throws declarations like this (from before) that need to be cleaned up.

maybe here we can add another assertion for the binary file contents
try (final InputStream inputStream = artifactManagement.loadArtifactBinary(artifact2.getSha1Hash()).get()
.getFileInputStream()) {
assertTrue("The stored binary matches the given binary",
IOUtils.contentEquals(new ByteArrayInputStream(randomBytes), inputStream));
}
Btw, this assertion is used in other places in this class, so maybe you can extract it to an own method, maybe with the name assertEqualFileContents(Optional<AbstractDBArtifact> artifact, byte[] randomBytes)

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
… however I filed an issue to support you better in this kind of setup (cf. eclipse/hawkbit#1036)
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Added mysql config to hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server/src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties:
spring.jpa.database=MYSQL
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hawkbit
spring.datasource.username=hawkbit
spring.datasource.password=hawkbit123
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
Built hawkbit :
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
when I run hawkbit as follow:
java -jar ./hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server/target/hawkbit-update-server-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
It run alright but there is no persistence.
when I run it with mysql profile:
java -jar ./hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server/target/hawkbit-update-server-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=mysql

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

Software update operations in large scale IoT scenarios with hundreds of thousands of devices require special handling.
That includes:
- Technical Scalability by means of horizontal scale of the hawkBit server cluster in the cloud.
- Global artifact content delivery capacities.
- Functional Scalability by means of:
- Secure handling of large volumes of devices at rollout creation time.
- Monitoring of the rollout progress.
- Emergency rollout shutdown in case of problems on to many devices.
Reporting capabilities for a complete understanding of the rollout progress at each point in time.
Eclipse hawkBit sees these capabilities under the term Rollout Management.
The following capabilities are currently supported by the Rollout Management:
- Create, update and start of rollouts.
- Selection of a DistributionSet.
- Auto-splitting of the input target list into a defined number deployment groups.
- Approval workflow
- Has to be enabled explicitly in configuration.
- Enables a workflow that requires a user with adequate permissions to review any new or updated rollout before it
Data Model
The hawkBit data model was designed to have enough flexibility to define complex software structures (e.g. operating system, runtimes, apps, different kind of artifacts) on one side and simplicity compared to the capabilities of a full blown configuration management on the other.
It does define a hierarchy of software that starts with a distribution, which can have (sub-)modules and these may have multiple artifacts. However, it does not consider any kind of dependency definitions between modules or artifacts. As a result dependency checks if necessary have to be done outside hawkBit, i.e. on the device itself or before the entity creation in hawkBit by the origin.
Provisioning Target Definition
A Provisioning Target is a neutral definition that may be an actual real device (e.g. gateway, embedded sensor) or a virtual device (e.g. vehicle, smart home).
The definition in hawkBit might reflect the transactional behavior if necessary on the device side. A vehicle might be updated device by device or as a whole. As a result one way of defining a vehicle in hawkBit could be to have one all inclusive Software Module or one module per (sub-) device.
Software Structure Definition
The structure defines the model of the supported software by the provisioning target
Distribution Set Type: defines a package structure that is supported by certain devices
Consists of Software Module Types both for
Firmware - device can have only one module of that type (e.g. the operating system)
Software - device can have multiple modules of that type (e.g. “Apps”)
Software Content Definition
Distribution Set: can be deployed to a provisioning target
Software Module: is a sub element of the distribution
e.g. OS, application, firmware X, firmware Y
Artifact: binaries for a software module. Note: the decision which artifacts have to be downloaded are done on the device side.

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@schabdo
@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’

@schabdo
@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Hi together, does anyone know how to mount an Azure File Share to the Hawkbit Pod in AKS? I guess the only way to do it is writing an own helm chart isn't it?

@Sergey-G-dev
Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

- Allows integration with 3rd party workflow engines.
Cascading start of the deployment groups based on installation status of the previous group.
Emergency shutdown of the rollout in case a group exceeds the defined error threshold.
Rollout progress monitoring for the entire rollout and the individual groups.
Cascading Deployment Group Execution
The cascading execution of the deployment groups is based on two thresholds that can be defined by the rollout creator.
- success condition by means of percentage of successfully installed targets in the current groups triggers.
- error condition by means of absolute or percentage of failed installations which triggers an emergency shutdown of the entire rollout.

Multi-Assignments (beta)
One of the main paradigms of Eclipse hawkBit is, that a Distribution Set represents the currently installed software of a device. Hence, a device can have only one Distribution Set assigned/installed at a time. With Multi-Assignments enabled, this paradigm shifts. Multi-Assignments allows to assign multiple Distribution Sets to a device simultaneously, without cancelling each other. As a consequence, an operator can trigger multiple campaigns addressing the same devices in parallel.
Action weight
To differentiate between important and less important updates a property called weight is used. When multi-assignments is enabled every action has a weight value between (and including) 0 and 1000. The higher the weight the more important is the assignment represented by the action. Also when defining a rollout or an auto-assignment and multi-assignments is enabled a weight value has to be provided. This value is passed to the actions created during the execution of these rollouts and auto-assignments. If no weight was provided the highest value of 1000 is used instead.

Entity Relationships
The public defined entities and their relation which are reflected by the Management API.
Deleting and Archiving Software Modules
When a user deletes a Software Module, the update server cannot simply remove all the corresponding data. Because when the Software Module is already assigned to a Distribution Set or was assigned to a Target in the past, the hawkBit server has to make sure that remains a clean and full update history for every target. The history contains all information (e.g. name, version) of the software, which was assigned to a specific Target. Obviously storing the binary data of the artifacts is not necessary for the history purpose.
The delete process which is performed, when there are historical connections to targets is called SoftDelete. This process marks the Software Module as deleted and removes the artifact, but it won’t delete the meta data, which describes the SoftwareModule and the associated Artifacts. SoftwareModules, which are marked as delete won’t be visible for the user, when he is requesting all SoftwareModules.
Just in case there are no connections to Distribution Sets and targets the server will perform a HardDelete. This process deletes all stored data, including all meta information.
In case of of a SoftDelete the unique constraints are still in place, i.e. you cannot create an entity with the same name/key. This constraint might be removed in future versions because of the impact on the user experience (i.e. he does not see the soft deleted module but cannot create a new one).

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl
Jalal
@jmlups_gitlab
ok i'll try that thanks @schabdo
Mikhail Tchernychev
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

@Holger-Seemueller
Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

Consequences
While this feature provides more flexibility to the user and enables new use-cases, there are also some consequences one should be aware of:
Critical
This feature is in beta and may change unannounced.
For now, this feature is opt-in only. Once activated, it cannot be deactivated.
Minor
While on DMF-API a MULTI_ACTION request is sent, DDI-API only exposes the next action which has the highest priority in the list of open actions(according to their weight property).
All information regarding the currently assigned or installed Distribution Set does only respect the last assignment, as well as the last successfully installed Distribution set. This also affects:
Pinning a target or Distribution Set in Deployment View.
Statistics about installed or assigned Distribution Sets.
Auto close running actions, when a new Distribution Set is assigned (repository.actions.autoclose.enabled) is deactivated.
Marking a Distribution Set to be a Required Migration Step is deactivated.

@RalfMengwasser
now i get a "Caused by: org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException: Unsupported Database: MariaDB 10.5"
now why is MariaDB 10.5 not supported? where can I read up on that?
RalfMengwasser
@RalfMengwasser
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider

@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
… however I filed an issue to support you better in this kind of setup (cf. eclipse/hawkbit#1036)
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
… however I filed an issue to support you better in this kind of setup (cf. eclipse/hawkbit#1036)
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

@Sergey-G-dev
Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Hi together, does anyone know how to mount an Azure File Share to the Hawkbit Pod in AKS? I guess the only way to do it is writing an own helm chart isn't it?

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

I would still propose my previous solution (with 2 return statements and final AbstractDbArtifact) in order to get rid of conditional here

Yes, but then we have "multiple return statements" and we still have to do the null check anyway.
I could move the check to an own line to make it simpler maybe. What do you think?
artifact = (artifact == null) ? storeArtifact(artifactUpload) : artifact;

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

@schabdo
@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hey,In the docs signature hosting is supported : https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/features/However i couldn't find any other information on artifact signature, any information would be appreciated

@BigFatDog
Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged?

hawkBit Update Server
The hawkBit Update Server is a standalone spring-boot application with an embedded servlet container .
On your own workstation
Run
java -jar hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server/target/hawkbit-update-server-*-SNAPSHOT.jar
(Note: you have to add the JDBC driver also to your class path if you intend to use another database than H2.)
Or:
run org.eclipse.hawkbit.app.Start

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

@RalfMengwasser
i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

Usage
The Management UI can be accessed via http://localhost:8080/UI
The Management API can be accessed via http://localhost:8080/rest/v1
Enable Clustering (experimental)
Clustering in hawkBit is based on Spring Cloud Bus. It is not enabled in the example app by default.
Add to your application.properties :
spring.cloud.bus.enabled=true
Add to your pom.xml :
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
Optional as well is the addition of Protostuff based message payload serialization for improved performance.
Add to your application.properties :
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.springCloudBusInput.content-type=application/binary+protostuff
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.springCloudBusOutput.content-type=application/binary+protostuff

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

@jmlups_gitlab
ok i'll try that thanks @schabdo
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
@bogdan-bondar Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line: hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296and it fixed the problem.

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

Hey,In the docs signature hosting is supported : https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/features/However i couldn't find any other information on artifact signature, any information would be appreciated

@BigFatDog
Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

hi... have just run the docker image, which I thought is standalone.... but it fails badly looking for an MQTT server!?

@mikhailtchernychev
Do you mean rarbbitmq? I had and issue if rabbitmq is already running on host. Then I had to stop it before using container
RalfMengwasser
@RalfMengwasser
no i didnt have it running... it was looking for it and didnt find it
RalfMengwasser
@RalfMengwasser
now i get a "Caused by: org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException: Unsupported Database: MariaDB 10.5"
now why is MariaDB 10.5 not supported? where can I read up on that?
RalfMengwasser
@RalfMengwasser
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
Hi, I have upload size problem with hawkbit.In the config/application.properties file I havespring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MBspring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MBspring.servlet.multipart.enabled=truespring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MBThis should allow me upload up to 4 GB.However, upload fails at limit of 1 GB:2020-10-19 17:00:14.749 INFO 32155 --- [qtp942804532-20] o.e.h.u.a.u.AbstractFileTransferHandler : Upload started for file update-2020.10.14-1.raucb:v:12020-10-19 17:02:09.113 INFO 32155 --- [qtp942804532-20] o.e.h.u.a.u.AbstractFileTransferHandler : Upload failed for file update-2020.10.14-1.raucb:v:1 due to reason: Maximum artifact size (1024 MB) exceededIf I don't put these values in application.properties upload stops right away, with repeated messages of size exceeding 1024MBPlease help.

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl
Jalal
@jmlups_gitlab
ok i'll try that thanks @schabdo
Mikhail Tchernychev
@mikhailtchernychev
@bogdan-bondar Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line: hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296and it fixed the problem.

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

MySQL 5.6 will reach EOL in 2021. Flyway 5.2.4 is the latest version still supporting MySQL 5.6. We won't be able to upgrade to a more recent version of Flyway until we discontinue support for MySQL 5.6 and move on to MySQL 5.7+.
Furthermore new version of Flyway will have better support for MariaDB by means forcing the JDBC driver to report MariaDB as a MySQL is not required anymore (cf. useMysqlMetadata in MariaDB connector parameters) in order to get it running:

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
… however I filed an issue to support you better in this kind of setup (cf. eclipse/hawkbit#1036)
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hi together, does anyone know how to mount an Azure File Share to the Hawkbit Pod in AKS? I guess the only way to do it is writing an own helm chart isn't it?

@RalfMengwasser
i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

fix bug: change sql-query in localArtifactRepository (eclipse#820)

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

Hi together, does anyone know how to mount an Azure File Share to the Hawkbit Pod in AKS? I guess the only way to do it is writing an own helm chart isn't it?

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

@BigFatDog
Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

I'm following these spring boot docs to make the env variable name, but it looks like I should have kept the dash in the name? HAWKBIT_ARTIFACT_URL_PROTOCOLS_DOWNLOAD-HTTP_REF seems to work.
To what value did you set the env variable?

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

@Sergey-G-dev
@Alexco500 This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like "id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)". That means this condition is true if id is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator =OUT= meaning the condition is true only if the id is NOT equal to any of those in the list.
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev thanks for providing an example! @Alexco500 it is kind of similar to the IN operator known from SQL

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

@Sergey-G-dev Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?
That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.

There is also an opposite operator =OUT= meaning the condition is true only if the id is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

Hi, I still fail to understand the =IN= parameters in filter definitions. Can someone provide an example with some explanations, please (slightly more than the one in the docs: Use =IN= for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2) :-) )? Thanks in advance.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@Sergey-G-dev Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?
That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

ok i'll try that thanks @schabdo

@bogdan-bondar Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line: hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296and it fixed the problem.

@schabdo We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (eclipse/hawkbit#1024). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo

@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:

@Sergey-G-dev thanks for providing an example! @Alexco500 it is kind of similar to the IN operator known from SQL
@RajeshReddyKa_twitter I think I have not fully understood your questions. May I asked you to elaborate a bit more on that?
As far as I understood you’d like to always soft delete a software module?

Yes... But i observe softDelete only happens when softwareModule has distribution. Is there any alternative to always softDelete so we can preserve all softwaremodules ?

The query parameter sort allows to define the sort order for the result of a query. A sort criteria consists of the name of a field and the sort direction (ASC for ascending and DESC descending). The sequence of the sort criteria (multiple can be used) defines the sort order of the entities in the result.
offset
The paging offset (default is 0).
q
Query fields based on the Feed Item Query Language (FIQL). See Entity Definitions for available fields.
Request query parameter example
GET /rest/v1/distributionsets?offset=1&limit=2&sort=version%3ADESC&q=name%3D%3DtestDS* HTTP/1.1

@Alexco500 This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like "id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)". That means this condition is true if id is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator =OUT= meaning the condition is true only if the id is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

Hi, I still fail to understand the =IN= parameters in filter definitions. Can someone provide an example with some explanations, please (slightly more than the one in the docs: Use =IN= for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2) :-) )? Thanks in advance.
Sergey Gerasimov
@Sergey-G-dev
@Sergey-G-dev Cool, I’ll have a look and provide feedback. Do I understand correctly that you focused on DDI API with your approach?
That's correct, since our devices use DDI API to communicate with hawkBit.

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo

@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
… however I filed an issue to support you better in this kind of setup (cf. eclipse/hawkbit#1036)

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Cleanup UI code after Vaadin mi… (compare)
Nov 05 08:59
@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?

I guess I´m missing some mapping or something like that. Maybe anyone can give me a hint where to look

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

@Sergey-G-dev
@schabdo We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (eclipse/hawkbit#1024). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Hi together, does anyone know how to mount an Azure File Share to the Hawkbit Pod in AKS? I guess the only way to do it is writing an own helm chart isn't it?

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

@bogdan-bondar Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line: hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296and it fixed the problem.

But still need it application.properties file something like that:spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4096MBspring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4096MBspring.servlet.multipart.enabled=truespring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=4096MB
Custom Theme
This guide provides details about using and creating themes that control the visual look of Eclipse hawkBit Management UI. Theme customization is done using Sass, which is an extension of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
The mechanism described below is the rather simple case by customizing the theme by means of configuring a set of variables as defined by the hawkBit default theme. A full customization be means of copying the hawkBit theme and customize it completely is not described here but of course possible.
Example App
An example application with customized theme can be found here.
Overview
Vaadin separates the appearance of the user interface from its logic using themes. Themes can include Sass or CSS style sheets, custom HTML layouts, and any necessary graphics.
Theme resources can also be accessed from application code as ThemeResource objects. Custom themes are placed under the src/main/resources/VAADIN/themes/ folder of the application.
This location is fixed – the VAADIN folder contains static resources that are served by the Vaadin servlet. The servlet augments the files stored in the folder by resources found from corresponding VAADIN folders contained in JARs in the class path.The base theme and all the corresponding custom themes are placed under the above mentioned folder.
If a new custom theme has to be created, it should always be placed under the src/main/resources/VAADIN/themes/ folder.
Every custom theme should always refer the base theme and customization can be done by the use of variables mentioned in the XXXXvariable.scss. For details of the creation of the custom theme please refer the next section.

A hawkBit update server can be accessed in four different ways:
Direct Device Integration (DDI) API by targets.
Management API by 3rd party applications.
Device Management Federation (DMF) API by 3rd party applications through AMQP.
Management UI by users.

Run hawkBit
In this guide we describe how to run a full featured hawkBit setup based on a production ready infrastructure. It is based on the hawkBit example modules and update server.
The update server can in fact be run stand alone. However, only with an embedded H2, no Device Management Federation API and no artifact storage.
System Architecture
This guide describes a target architecture that is more like one that you will expect in a production system.
hawkBit Update Server.
MariaDB for the repository.
RabbitMQ for DMF communication.
For testing and demonstration purposes we will also use:
hawkBit Device Simulator.

Feign Client
In this guide we describe how to create a Feign Rest Client based on a Spring Boot Application.
Create Feign REST Client
hawkBit provides REST interfaces for Management API and DDI API. Using this interfaces you can create a feign client with the help of the feign inheritance support.
Our example modules demonstrate how to create Feign client resources. Here you can find the Management API client resources and the DDI client resources.
A small simulator application demonstrates how you can interact with the hawkBit via the Management API
.
Example Management API simulator
In the follow code section, you can a see a feign client resource example. The interface extend the origin api interface to declare the @FeignClient. The @FeignClientdeclares that a REST client with that interface should be created.
public interface MgmtTargetClientResource extends MgmtTargetRestApi {
}

Release notes
Management API
The Management API is a RESTful API that enables to perform Create/Read/Update/Delete operations for provisioning targets (i.e. devices) and repository content (i.e. software).
Based on the Management API you can manage and monitor software update operations via HTTP/HTTPS. The Management API supports JSON payload with hypermedia as well as filtering, sorting and paging. Furthermore the Management API provides permission based access control and standard roles as well as custom role creation.
The API is protected and needs authentication and authorization based on the security concept.
API Version
hawkBit provides an consistent Management API interface that guarantees backwards compatibility for future releases by version control.
The current version of the Management API is version 1 (v1) with the URI http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/
API Resources
Supported HTTP-methods are:
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE
Available Management APIs resources are:
Direct Device Integration API
The hawkBit update server provides REST resources which are consumed by the device to retrieve software update tasks.
This API is based on HTTP standards and a polling mechanism.
In DDI the target is identified using a controllerId. Controller is used as a term for the actual service/client on the device. That allows users to have in some cases even multiple clients on the same target for different tasks, e.g. Firmware update and App management.
State Machine Mapping
For historical reasons the DDI has a different state machine and status messages than the Target State Machine of the hawkBit update server.
This is kept in order to ensure that DDI stays compatible for devices out there in the field. A future version “2” of DDI might change that. DDI also defines more states than the update server, e.g. multiple DDI states are currently mapped by the DDI implementation to RUNNING state. It is possible that in the future hawkBit will fully leverage these additional states.
The DDI API allows the device to provide the following feedback messages:
DDI status.execution type
handling by update server
Mapped ActionStatus type
CANCELED
This is send by the target as confirmation of a cancellation request by the update server.
CANCELED
REJECTED
This is send by the target in case an update of a cancellation is rejected, i.e. cannot be fulfilled at this point in time. Note: the target should send a CLOSED->ERROR if it believes it will not be able to proceed the action at all.

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes.

@Alexco500 This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like "id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)". That means this condition is true if id is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator =OUT= meaning the condition is true only if the id is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

@schabdo We use hawkBit to manage updates for over 1.5 Million of customer devices. As it turns out, hawkBit is not very well optimized to handle that many devices, particularly when doing auto assigments, searching for targets with specific attributes or managing target filters. So since I joined the company 3 months ago, I've been working to improve the performance. Please check out my other pull request - (eclipse/hawkbit#1024). This is my approach to optimize autoassignments. The description is provided.

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Update: the error disappeared after clicking "Generate Sources and Update Folders" in Maven menu (and executing Maven build again afterwards).

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider

@RalfMengwasser
i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hello, I have a question of deployment. In management UI, I create a target (with a fake http address) and a DS, then assign DS to the target. From target's action history, I see the DS is immediately in "RUNNING" status. My understanding is the target need to poll from update server to trigger the download (execute the assigned DS), however, the "RUNNING" status shows UpdateServer is pushing DS to the target based on the fake address, which shouldn't happen since manually added target has no polling logic. I'm confused, anything wrong with my understanding? I read code but get no clue.

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
Procedure to create a theme
Create a new folder “XXXtheme” (significant to the new theme) under src/main/resources/VAADIN/themes/ folder.
Create a folder named as “customstyles”.
Create a XXXvariables.scss file under customstyles folder, putting all the variables inside the same file. For more details about the variables we recommend to take a look at the hawkBit defaults.
Create styles.scss file under the “XXXtheme” folder.
Any images should be placed under the sub folder “images” folder.
Within the styles.scss file, import XXXvariables.scss and the base theme (hawkBit theme as mentioned in previous chapter Overview . Please find below the syntax:
@import "../hawkbit/customstyles/hawkbitvariables";
@import "customstyles/examplevariables";
@import "../hawkbit/hawkbittheme";
@import "addons";
.exampletheme {
@include addons;
@include hawkbittheme;
}
Finally the structure should be as in the example app.
Procedure to add a custom footer
hawkBit supports multiple ways to authenticate a target against the server. The different authentication modes can be individual enabled and disabled within hawkBit. Both on system level (with Spring Boot properties) as per individual tenant.
Target Security Token Authentication
There is a 32 alphanumeric character security-token for each created target within IoT hawkBit. This token can be used to authenticate the target at hawkBit through the HTTP-Authorization header with the custom scheme TargetToken.
GET /SPDEMO/controller/v1/0e945f95-9117-4500-9b0a-9c6d72fa6c07 HTTP/1.1
Host: your.hawkBit.server
Authorization: TargetToken bH7XXAprK1ChnLfKSdtlsp7NOlPnZAYY
The target security token is provided in DMF API as part of the update message in order to allow DMF clients to leverage the feature or can it be manually retrieved per target by Management API or in the Management UI in the target details.
Note: needs to be enabled in your hawkBit installation and in the tenant configuration. That allows both the operator as well as the individual customer (if run in a multi-tenant setup) to enable this access method. See DdiSecurityProperties for system wide enablement.
The additional activation for the individual tenant:
Gateway Security Token Authentication
Often the targets are connected through a gateway which manages the targets directly and as a result are indirectly connected to the hawkBit update server.
To authenticate this gateway and allow it to manage all target instances under its tenant there is a GatewayToken to authenticate this gateway through the HTTP-Authorization header with a custom scheme GatewayToken. This is of course also handy during development or for testing purposes. However, we generally recommend to use this token with care as it allows to act in the name of any device.
GET /SPDEMO/controller/v1/0e945f95-9117-4500-9b0a-9c6d72fa6c07 HTTP/1.1
Host: your.hawkBit.server
Authorization: GatewayToken 3nkswAZhX81oDtktq0FF9Pn0Tc0UGXPW
Note: needs to be enabled in your hawkBit installation and in the tenant configuration. That allows both the operator as well as the individual customer (if run in a multi-tenant setup) to enable this access method. See DdiSecurityProperties for system wide enablement.
hawkBit Management API example client.
Prerequisites
You have a working hawkBit core build.
You have a working hawkBit examples build.
Adapt hawkBit Update Server and Device Simulator to your environment.
As mentioned you can create your own application with hawkBit inside or adapt the existing example app. The second option will be shown here.
Set MariaDB dependency to compile in the update server POM
<dependency>
<groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
<artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
<scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
Configure MariaDB/MySQL connection settings.
For this you can either edit the existing application.properties or create a new profile.
spring.jpa.database=MYSQL
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/YOUR_SCHEMA
spring.datasource.username=YOUR_USER
This interface can be autowired and use as a normal java interface:
public class CreateStartedRolloutExample {
@Autowired
private MgmtTargetClientResource targetResource;
public void run() {
// create ten targets
targetResource.createTargets(new TargetBuilder().controllerId("00-FF-AA-0").name("00-FF-AA-0")
.description("Targets used for rollout example").buildAsList(10));
}
At hawkbit-example-core-feign-client is a spring configuration to auto configure some beans, which can be reused for a own feign client.
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnClass(Feign.class)
@Import(FeignClientsConfiguration.class)
public class FeignClientConfiguration {
@Bean
public ApplicationJsonRequestHeaderInterceptor jsonHeaderInterceptor() {
return new ApplicationJsonRequestHeaderInterceptor();
Targets
Distribution sets
Distribution set types
Software modules
Software module types
Target tag
Distribution set tag
Rollouts
Target filters
System configuration
Headers
For all requests an Authorization header has to be set.
Username: Tenant\username
Password: password
Also have a look to the Security chapter.
In addition, for POST and PUT requests the Content-Type header has to be set. Accepted content-types are.
application/json
application/hal+json
WARNING
CLOSED
Target completes the action either with status.result.finished SUCCESS or FAILURE as result. Note: DDI defines also a status NONE which will not be interpreted by the update server and handled like SUCCESS.
ERROR (DDI FAILURE) or FINISHED (DDI SUCCESS or NONE)
PROCEEDING
This can be used by the target to inform that it is working on the action.
RUNNING
SCHEDULED
This can be used by the target to inform that it scheduled on the action.
RUNNING
RESUMED
This can be used by the target to inform that it continued to work on the action.

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

Hi, i have a question regarding secure operation of an Hawkbit instance: I would like to expose only those endpoints to internet that are needed for my devices. The Management UI for example should only be available in intranet. Can you tell me if their are best practices to achieve that, e.g. by liminiting access to specific URI paths?

@Alexco500 This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like "id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)". That means this condition is true if id is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator =OUT= meaning the condition is true only if the id is NOT equal to any of those in the list.

Hi together, does anyone know how to mount an Azure File Share to the Hawkbit Pod in AKS? I guess the only way to do it is writing an own helm chart isn't it?

Hi all,I have a question regarding DMF API and RabbitMQ. As I understand, DMF API requires a running Rabbit service in order to connect to port 5762 to communicate with Rabbit. In our ecosystem we do not use DMF but still need to have a running Rabbit service because otherwise DMF will generate errors and exceptions as it fails to connect to Rabbit. So my question is: is it possible to disable DMF module (exclude from Maven build) so that we wouldn't need a running Rabbit instance? I tried to remove Maven dependencies of DMF, AMPQ and Rabbit but even after that hawkBit attempts to connect to 5762.

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

@bogdan-bondar Thank you, it worked. I put into my config/application.properties the following line: hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize=4294967296and it fixed the problem.

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

Anonymous access
Here we offer general anonymous access for all targets (see DdiSecurityProperties) which we consider not really sufficient for a production system but it might come in handy to get a project started in the beginning.
However, anonymous download on the other side might be interesting even in production for scenarios where the artifact itself is already encrypted.

Configure RabbitMQ connection settings for update server and device simulator (optional).
We provide already defaults that should work with a standard Rabbit installation. Otherwise configure the following in the application.properties of the two services:
spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
spring.rabbitmq.password=guest
spring.rabbitmq.virtualHost=/
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
Adapt hostname of example scenario creation script
Should only be necessary if your system does not run on localhost or uses a different port than the example app.
Adapt application.properties in this case:
hawkbit.url=localhost:8080
or provide the parameter on command line:

@schabdo One question regarding #1024 - after fixing the issues mentioned by the hawkbit-bot, what's the preferred way of pushing them - should I do an amend commit + force push or just another usual commit and push?

I'm following these spring boot docs to make the env variable name, but it looks like I should have kept the dash in the name? HAWKBIT_ARTIFACT_URL_PROTOCOLS_DOWNLOAD-HTTP_REF seems to work.
To what value did you set the env variable?

@Alexco500 This should be pretty straightforward, let's say we have something like "id=IN=(0123, 3210, 4567)". That means this condition is true if id is equal to one of those in the list. There is also an opposite operator =OUT= meaning the condition is true only if the id is NOT equal to any of those in the list.
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
@Sergey-G-dev thanks for providing an example! @Alexco500 it is kind of similar to the IN operator known from SQL
@RajeshReddyKa_twitter I think I have not fully understood your questions. May I asked you to elaborate a bit more on that?
As far as I understood you’d like to always soft delete a software module?

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

Features
Compile & Run example scenario creation script (optional)
This has to be done before the device simulator is started. hawkBit creates the mandatory tenant metadata with first login into either Management UI or API (which is done by this client).
However, this is not done by DMF which is in fact used by the device simulator, i.e. without calling Management API first hawkBit would drop all DMF messages as the tenant is unknown.
Compile & Run device simulator (optional)

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!

@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted

After sometime of digging it seems that many poeple reported the same error since 2016!
maybe it woth to notify it it in the README of the project;-)
to whom it may interest, the database should be created with COLLATE option to work with hawkbit:

Query OK, 24 rows affected (0.13 sec)
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE hawkbit;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
MariaDB [(none)]> ALTER DATABASE hawkbit COLLATE latin1_bin;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
MariaDB [(none)]> grant all privileges on hawkbit.* TO 'hawkbit'@'localhost' identified by 'hawkbit123';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

@RalfMengwasser
i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

I'm following these spring boot docs to make the env variable name, but it looks like I should have kept the dash in the name? HAWKBIT_ARTIFACT_URL_PROTOCOLS_DOWNLOAD-HTTP_REF seems to work.

ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!

I'm not sure if setting collation is really required since latin1 is the default of MariaDB (cf. here).
Do you use any special Linux distro running MariaDB on? If so may I ask you about the default collation? I double-checked with latest MariaDB on Ubuntu without any issues:

Regarding 2: If you only use DDI, UI and Managment API port 8080 is sufficent. If you’d like to use DMF API there is more to consider
Dominic Schabel

@RalfMengwasser: Regarding 1, I’m affraid such a fine grained access control on device level is not possible as of today. Changing passwords depends on the kind of “provide” e.g. property based, in memory or OAuth2

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

i got a few general questions:
Is there some sort of user management so I can say user X can manage devices Y and user Z devices W? Where do I change passwords?
Which ports do I have to open for the devices? Is the 8080 the same for user login AND device updates?

Hi all,suddenly I'm getting the following error when trying to build/run hawkbit:java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaDistributionSet is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObject
java: org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.jpa.model.JpaSoftwareModule is not abstract and does not override abstract method _persistence_shallow_clone() in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.descriptors.PersistenceObjectI executed 'maven clean install' a few times and it went without any errors, but that error still appears. Has anyone experienced that?
P.S. The error disappears if I add an empty method body to those two classes, but that doesn't seem right.

Hey, whenever i try to upload a file to hawkbit as an artifact, i get a response with message : 'org.eclipse.jetty.io.RuntimeIOException: java.io.IOException: Missing initial multi part boundary',haven't found any issue about this on github,i am pretty sure i set a multipart boundary, did it manually just for testing and it shows on wireshark. Anyone knows what could be the issue ?

Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need
You can add the logger here. After that you should see one of this statements for target token authentication of the device. This will allow you to see at least if the header is sent.

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’

@mikhailtchernychev this restriction is coming from the DOS filter, you need to set the following properties:hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactSize and hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxArtifactStorage in bytes. Default values are 1_073_741_824 (1GB) for max artifact size and 21_474_836_480 (20GB) for max artifact storage

@jmlups_gitlab not sure what you exactly did in order to provoke this error. But if you have wireshark already in place this working curl command should help you figuring out the difference:curl 'https://hawkbit.eclipse.org/rest/v1/softwaremodules/1/artifacts' -i -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v' -v -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -X POST -F 'file=@myTestFile.txt’
You just need a file named myTestFile.txt within same path as you execute curl

Hi all, is there a log on the Hawkbit somewhere where target authentication errors are logged? Can't find any logging of this sort on the UI except for last poll date/time - which is one of the things that does not work if authentication is failing. It'd be great to be able to grep through the log and find those that are failing to authenticate. Thank you!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
ok obviously cause maria says its maria and not mysql.
@RalfMengwasser that’s strange. The guys from Flyway claim to support MariaDB at least up to 10.4 (cf. here). As you already found out MariaDB seems to report itself as MariaDB instead of MySQL. Luckily this can be fixed :smile:
Changing datasource url within your docker setup to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/hawkbit?useMysqlMetadata=true will do the trick and MariaDB 10.5 will be accepted
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
As soon as we’re able to upgrade Flyway to a more recent version this won’t be required anymore. Sorry for that!
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
… however I filed an issue to support you better in this kind of setup (cf. eclipse/hawkbit#1036)

@mdymov-hayward nothing in UI available. Usually hawkBit is not showing any client errors since this would flood the logs and is a potential attack vector in terms of DOS. However I think you can switch on some loggers to gain more insights but I have to double check
mdymov-hayward
@mdymov-hayward
@schabdo It would be great to be able to do that via loggers; I am assuming changing logging config will require Hawkbit restart?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed it requires a restart. Raising logging level of org.eclipse.hawkbit.security.ControllerPreAuthenticateSecurityTokenFilter to DEBUG should be all you need

I would say that Ubuntu is far more popular than Debian and that all people who are experimenting with Hawkbit will get the same issue.

Ubuntu 18.04 and nothing special about MariaDB which was installed via apt install
I see, now I'm able to reproduce your issue. It only occurres if you install MariaDB from the default Ubuntu repository via apt install:
The packages provided by Debian's and Ubuntu's default repositories are generated using the Debian packaging in Debian's mirror of MariaDB's source code, which contains some custom changes
This will result in MariaDB 10.1.44 and defaults to utf8mb4 (cf. System Variables). InnoDB engine has a limit on index size of 767 bytes if the table is using REDUNDANT or COMPACT row format. Due to the use of utf8mb4 this limit will be exceeded by adding index to update_status (VARCHAR 191 instead of 255 would be the max possible value in this case):
Error Code : 1071
Message : Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes
Statement : create index sp_idx_target_info_02 on sp_target_info (target_id, update_status)
However index limit was increased in MariaDB 10.2 and higher. Can you please verify if using either official MariaDB repository (cf. here) or a more recent MariaDB version is solving your issue? Since MariaDB 10.1 is only supported till October 2020 I'd recommend to upgrade anyways. Having this said, I totally agree that we should add a note to the docs for Ubuntu users

@schabdo I have a running system I'd avoid to mess up with the DB if I update it.
But you are right it will be great to add a hint in the documentation about the version of the MariaDB to be used :-)
Thanks for taking time to support 👍

I see, now I'm able to reproduce your issue. It only occurres if you
install MariaDB *from the default Ubuntu repository* via |apt install|:

are generated using the Debian packaging in Debian's mirror of
MariaDB's source code, which contains some custom changes
This will result in MariaDB 10.1.44 and defaults to |utf8mb4| (cf.

engine has a limit on index size of |767| bytes if the table is using
|REDUNDANT| or |COMPACT| row format. Due to the use of |utf8mb4| this
* Adapted AbstractGrid for resize support, adapted ActionHistoryGrid, ActionStatusGrid, ActionStatusMsgGrid
* added rollout window specific classes (layouts, controllers, component builders)
* changed Rollout/Group/Target List Grids to use vaadin 8 concepts, added temp utility classes
* added ArtifactDataProvider and corresponding ProxyArtifact, SoftwareModuleArtifactsStateDataProvider, SoftwareModuleDistributionsStateDataProvider, TargetFilterStateDataProvider, TargetManagementStateDataProvider, TargetTagDataProvider and corresponding mappers
* added parent Type model class for DistributionSetType and SoftwareModuleType and corresponding ProxyType, added ActionDataProvider, ActionStatusDataProvider, ActionStatusMsgDataProvider, DistributionSetTagDataProvider, DistributionSetTypeDataProvider, SoftwareModuleTypeDataProvider and corresponding mappers
* extended data providers with filter, implemented multiple distribution set data providers for sifferent ui state (views), added target tag data provider, adapted Proxy Tag
* added data providers, mappers and proxy classes for fetching entities from backend and mapping them to ui proxy entities
* removed setImmediate on classes
* fixed usage of option group layouts, removed all setImmediate calls
* removed flexibleoptiongroup dependency and adapted the Option Group Layouts to use the default RadioButtonGroup
* adapted Vaadin Security and fixed Notifications
* Migrated vaadin 7 sources with the Vaadin migration tool to vaadin 8 compatibility mode
* fixed some minor sonar issues
* fixed license headers
* fixed dynamic stylesheet js license header
* adapted java docs parameters description, removed unused event classes
* fixed icon styles, made action icons a little bigger

limit will be exceeded by adding index to |update_status| (VARCHAR |191|
instead of |255| would be the max possible value in this case):
|Error Code : 1071 Message : Specified key was too long; max key length
is 767 bytes Statement : create index sp_idx_target_info_02 on
sp_target_info (target_id, update_status) |
However index limit was increased in MariaDB 10.2 and higher. Can you
please verify if using either official MariaDB repository (cf. here
<https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-package-repository-setup-and-usage>)
or a more recent MariaDB version is solving your issue? Since MariaDB
10.1 is only supported till October 2020 I'd recommend to upgrade
anyways. Having this said, I totally agree that we should add a note to
the docs for Ubuntu users
Thing is that it is common to install packages belonging to the distro,
letting update the whole distro instead of upgrade single packages. For
Ubuntu 18.04, MariaDB 10.1 is packaged and it is the choice for most
Ubuntu's users. Switching to Ubuntu 20.04, MariaDB is updated to 10.3

* disable Autoassignment link in case of missing read repository permissions, disable TFQ save button in case of missing update target permissions
* adapted ordering of columns in maximized state
* limited selection in grids to 1000 entities, removed shift+ctrl selection behaviour (due to complex logic for preserving and limiting selection) disable edit/copy rollout on creation, small naming changes and java docs improvements
* added java docs to notification class
* fixed restoration of the default filter value for grids
* added caption to Delete column in grids, made target filter grid columns hidable, stoped propagation of select all event in order to not select the text on the page
* removed com.google.gwt.gwtmockito test dependency
* renamed RemoteEventsListener to HawkbitEntityEventListener to better describe the use-case for the listener
* changed Guava cache to Caffeine cache for EntityModified UI events
* removed obsolete HawkbitErrorNotificationMessage, UINotification is used instead
* added stacked notifications custom extension

I think this won't guarantee that the server actually uses the correct encoding if you manually add it to the test

We had to implement a workaround for the tests here as the download Tests were failing when setting server.servlet.encoding.enabled=true for all the tests, due to a bug in MockHttpServletResponse, that will be fixed within 5.2.9. With this test, we want to ensure that charset=utf-8 is still returned in the response, because we can't test it within the other tests right now.
