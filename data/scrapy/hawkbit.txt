IoT. Update. Device.
Eclipse hawkBit™ is a domain independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking infrastructure.
Interfaces
hawkBit offers a direct device integration via HTTP or a device management federation API which allows to connect devices with different protocol adapter. Users can make use of the graphical user interface and other service can interact with hawkBit through the RESTful management API.
Rollout
hawkBit supports an easy and flexible rollout management which allows you to update a large amount of devices in separated groups.
Cascading start of the deployment groups based on installation status of the previous group.
Emergency shutdown of the rollout in case a group exceeds the defined error threshold.
Rollout progress monitoring for the entire rollout and the individual groups.
Package Model
A software update does not always contain only a single file. The hawkBit meta model allows you to configure your files in virtual software and distribution packages.

What is hawkBit?
Eclipse hawkBit™ is an domain-independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking infrastructure.
Why Software Updates in IoT?
Having software update capabilities ensures a secure IoT by means that it gives IoT projects a fighting chance against pandora’s box that they opened the moment their devices got connected. From that moment on devices are at the forefront of IT security threats many embedded software developers historically never had to face. Shipping for instance a Linux powered device connected to the Internet without any security updates ever applied during its lifetime is kind of a suicidal act these days.
A more charming argument for software update is that it enables agile development for hardware and hardware near development. Concepts like a minimum viable product can be applied for devices as not all features need to be ready at manufacturing time. Changes on the cloud side of the IoT project can be applied to the devices at runtime as well.
Sometimes Software Update is a business model on its own as it makes devices much more attractive to the customer if they are updateable, i.e. they do not only buy a product because of its current feature set but make also a bet on its future capabilities. In addition new revenue streams may arise from the fact that feature extensions can potentially be monetized (e.g. Apps) without the need to design, manufacture and ship a new device (revision).
Why hawkBit?
Updating software
(components) on constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways is as mentioned before a
common requirement

Rollout Management
Software update operations in large scale IoT scenarios with hundreds of thousands of devices require special handling.
[...]
Target State Machine
A target has a current state which reflects the provisioning status of the device at this point in time. State changes are driven either by the update server by means of starting an update or by the controller on the provisioning target that gives feedback to the update server, e.g. “I am here”, “I am working on a provisioning”, “I have finished a provisioning”.

How to Filter
The basic syntax to filter is:
field<basic_operator>value <composite_operator> field<basic_operator>value <...>
field
: is the name of the resource field.
value
: is the value of the target field
<basic_operator>
: Are operators to do simple queries. Supported basic operators are:
==
: equal
!=
: not equal
Use
=IN=
for ‘in’ parameter.(Example: name=IN=(target1,target2).
<composite_operator>
: Are operators to join simple queries: Supported composite operators are:
and
in most IoT scenarios.
At the time being, this process is
usually handled by the IoT solution itself
, sometimes backed by a full fledged device management system. We believe that this approach generates unnecessary
duplicate work
in the IoT space, in particular when considering the challenges of implementing a safe and reliable remote software update process: the software update process must never fail and also must never be compromised as, at the one hand, it can be used to fix almost any issue/problem on the device but at the same time also poses the greatest security threat if mis-used to introduce malicious code to the device.
In addition we believe the software update process to be relatively
independent from particular application domains
when seen from the back-end (cloud) perspective. Updating the software for an entire car may differ from updating the firmware of a single sensor with regard to the connectivity of the device to the cloud and also to the complexity of the software package update process on the device. However, the process of rolling out the software, e.g. uploading an artifact to the repository, assigning it to eligible devices, managing the roll out campaign for a large number of devices, orchestrating content delivery networks to distribute the package, monitoring and reporting the progress of the roll-out and last but not least requirements regarding security and reliability are quite similar.
Existing
device management systems
usually
lack
the capability to
efficiently organize roll outs at IoT scale
, e.g. splitting the roll out into sub groups, cascading them, automatically stopping the roll out after a defined error threshold etc. They are also usually restricted to a single device management protocol, either a proprietary one or one of the existing standard protocols like LWM2M, OMA-DM or TR-069. Even if they support more than one such protocol, they are often a result of the device management protocol they started with and restricted in their adoption capabilities to others.
device management system introduces unnecessary (and unwanted) complexity
to many IoT projects. This is particularly true for IoT solutions working with constrained devices where requirements regarding generic device management are often very limited only but a secure & reliable software update process is still mandatory.
As a result we have the need for a domain independent solution
that works for the majority of IoT projects
that goes beyond the pure update and handles more complex
roll out strategies
needed by large scale IoT projects.
that at the same time is
focused on software updates
in the IoT space
and that is able to work on its own for simple scenarios while having the capability to integrate with existing device management systems and protocols.
Cloud Ready
Technical Scalability
: connect millions of devices and ship terabytes of software on a global scale.
Functional Scalability
: rollouts with hundreds of thousands of individual devices in it.
Reliability
: software update as the last line of defense against device faults and vulnerabilities.
Managed device complexity
: device topologies inside each individual provisioning target.
Integration flexibility
: connect and integrate through various (non-)standardized device management protocols directly or through federated device managements.

Gives all targets with their name starting with ‘CCU’ and which are in ‘pending’ state.
(assignedds.name==‘ECU-DS’ and description==test) or updatestatus!=error
Gives all targets which are either assigned to ‘ECU-DS’ and have description equals to ‘test’ or which are not in error status.
(updatestatus!=In_sync or updatestatus!=error) and name==*SHC1*
Gives all targets that do not have the update status In_sync or error and that contains the term SHC1 in their name.
(updatestatus!=error or updatestatus!=pending) and (name==*CCU* or description==*CCU*)
Gives all targets that either have the term ‘CCU’ in their name or their description and that either have the
update status
not in state error or pending.
Auto assignment
It is possible to assign some distribution set with different action types (
forced
,
soft
, or
download only
) to all targets that belong to the corresponding custom target filter, including the ones, that are registered later on.
In order to activate the auto-assignment, one should first click on
Auto assignment
cell in Custom Filters table, and then check the corresponding checkbox. After that, the action type and distribution set for auto-assignment should be selected and confirmed.
As long as the auto-assignment stays active, the scheduler will try to assign selected distribution set to corresponding custom filter targets, that have never seen it before.

Hello there noscripter!
CircleCI uses JavaScript pretty heavily to provide a good experience and to allow us to develop code a lot faster. We recognize that the tradeoff is that people using noscript get a worse experience, and we apologize for that.
So let us pitch you quickly on why you should enable JavaScript and view our site. CircleCI is
powerful, fast, and easy-to-use Continuous Integration and Deployment
for web applications.
CircleCI is easy to set up, incredibly fast, allows you to get your code to customers faster, and will even automatically parallelize your tests over many machines to get results to you faster. If that sounds useful, we'd encourage you to whitelist us in noscript and read about it yourself :)

I dont know where the right place is for reaching „many“ people so I try it here. I met
@schabdo
offline last week and we discussed the possibility of having a Meetup around Hawkbit which I quite like. We would offer to do it at our office in Nürtingen / Kirchheim unter Teck (and of couse sponsoring Pizza and Beer). Who would be generally interested in such an Event?
Julian
@JulianFeinauer
Oh and another question… is it possibl to share devices between Ditto and Hawkbit?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
is it possibl to share devices between Ditto and Hawkbit?
Possible yes, but there is no out of the box integration yet. So you have to do the “sharing” by yourself
Julian
@JulianFeinauer
hmm
okay, what a pitty
Julian
@JulianFeinauer
So in a common setup one would need a „hook“ or something to get every device from ditto and add it into hawkbit, right?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Exactly, something like that. You may have a look at
eclipse/hawkbit#796

thanks a lot for your proposal to start/host a meetup around hawkBit :+1:

there is a limit for the length of the targetFilterQuery string of 1024 characters. Have a look at the response you get from your REST call, it should contain the message "targetFilterQuery size must be between 1 and 1024."
@StefanKlt
thanks for reply ! Is there a way to increase the length of the targetFilterQuery, through some property configuration or something else? actually my requirement is to pass 1000 macAddess but currently i'm able to pass 55-60 macAddress. Please suggest.
Stefan Klotz
@StefanKlt
@krishnaitwa
this value is defined in org.eclipse.hawkbit.repository.model.TargetFilterQuery interface (remember that you might also have to adapt your database when you increase the value). But I don't think such a long query is a good idea. Have you considered using target attributes or targaet metadata? Maybe filter like "metadata.deviceType==TypeX" would make more sense.

@mangexl
Have anyone used JdbcLockRegistry to handle locks. I am getting "Lock wait timeout" when handling rollouts in status starting, it seems to hang on JpaRolloutManagement.createActionsForTargetsInNewTransaction. Running 0.3.0M2.
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Is there anything else working on the DB besides hawkBit?
mangexl
@mangexl
No, it is just hawkbit working on it. And I run a single instance, so there is only one instance connecting to the database.
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
I see. That’s stange. Can you have a look into the DB there should be a table for the lock. Maybe you’ll find more details here

@mangexl
I have done it, but I can not figure out why it isn't releasing the connection. It is locked on statement INSERT INTO sp_action.

Hi
@all
:). Very nice the new 0.3.0M6 release! Thanks a lot for the devleopers, especially
@schabo
and
@axdotl
.One thing I want to ask you is, what is a nice & easy way for hosting an openid instance, so I can use this nice new feature:

And do you know if there is there a more lightweight solution for rabbitmq?

has anyone used libcurl to connect to DDI API, This is what ia m trying to post to configData
{
"data": {
"Location": "ss"
},
"status": {
"execution": "closed",
"result": {
"finished": "success"
}
}

and i get following error :
{"exceptionClass":"org.eclipse.hawkbit.rest.exception.MessageNotReadableException","errorCode":"hawkbit.server.error.rest.body.notReadable","message":"The given request body is not well formed"}
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
Indeed
@mei-tech_gitlab
, glad to hear that you like it! Things are sorted so I’m happy to officially announce the availability of milestone
0.3.0M6
now :smile:
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
From now on hawkBit will also use Stack Overflow for community support. The official tag is

Regarding your RabbitMQ question, I’m sorry don’t know any

Will you eventually make a release on the hawkbit-extension repository? Or the top of master should be fine

Top of master is fine. It already uses new milestone from hawkbit

the json looks good. I tested against hawkBit and it worked. The call looked like this:

Today I learned about meander.io. From what I learned it seems to be somewhat similar to hawkbit. Does anybody know mender and can help me with the differentiation or comparison?

Hello !
I need to take the datas stored in a H2 DB inside a running docker container. and transfer it into a MySQL DB.
I desperately look for the spring.datasource.url that is used in the default docker image, but i can't find it
Is my data saved in a file that i can find somewhere or is it save in memory ?
How would you do ?
Dominic Schabel
@schabdo
I think the easiest way for exporting data is to use H2 console. However this will require restart of container since console is not enabled by default. Setting
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
should do the trick
esunea
@esunea
thanks, i gonna try this and tell you if it worked
