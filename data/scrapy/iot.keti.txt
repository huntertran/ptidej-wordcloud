Keti is a service that was designed to protect RESTfuls API using Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).
The solution itself is implemented as a cloud-native RESTful API that adheres to the guiding principles of the
twelve factor app
. Key characteristics of the service include:
Central management of policies and privileges
The ability to manage hierarchical privileges (e.g. sub-groups) and scoped privileges (e.g. assigning elevated privileges based on the resource accessed)
A policy format tailored for developers who build RESTful APIs
An access control decision engine
Spring Boot
is the primary framework that Keti is built on. Additionally Keti uses the following open source libraries:
JanusGraph
, an implementation of
Apache TinkerPop
, for it's graph data structure
Jedis
as a
Redis
client for caching
Spring Security
to protect it's API
Spring Data JPA
for persistence to RDBMS
An operator deploys Keti in the same datacenter where the web services it protects are deployed. Either a common gateway, or the web service itself, sends requests for authorized access to Keti and enforces the decision received in the response. When deployed, Keti typically has the following service dependencies.
UAA
as an OAuth server
Redis
(optional) for decision caching
Cassandra
through JanusGraph for graph persistence
PostgreSQL
, or
H2
as a RDBMS
Below is a basic diagram of how Keti fits in the interaction between web application and web service.

Who's Involved
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

The mission of the top-level project is to provide open source technology that will be used to build IoT solutions for industry and consumers. It will focus on:
Standards and Protocols implementations that can easily be consumed by end solution developers as well as framework developers
Frameworks and Services that abstract the complexity of hardware, communication and data stack manipulation
Tools that facilitate the development of connected systems
Solutions that build ready-to-run solutions based on the other building blocks
This document describes the composition and organization of the project, roles and responsibilities of the participants, and development process for the project.

Eclipse SCAVA
Tools
Software engineers spend most of their time learning to understand the software they maintain or depend on (or will depend on). The goal of this learning process is to support decision-making. In this project, we focus on the increasing dependence on open-source software (OSS) over the last years and the decisions related to depending on open-source software. Eclipse SCAVA will support the eﬃcient and eﬀective decision-making regarding dependence on OSS projects and components thereof. This entails both decisions on the architecture level (to decide to select and OSS project) and on the code level (to design the use of the OSS project). In particular, SCAVA will provide techniques and tools for extracting knowledge from existing open source components, and use such knowledge to properly select and reuse existing software to develop new systems. The activity of the developer will be continuously monitored in order to raise alerts related to the quality of the selected OSS projects and to give suggestions that can reduce the development eﬀort and increase the quality of the ﬁnal software products.
