This project has been provisioned. You can see the proposal

Motivation
Developers frequently encounter the need to model units
of
measurement, because objects in the real world are subject to these measures. When working with units, developers need to understand the mathematics
of
units, how to convert between systems, and how to format and parse string representations
of
units. Most
of
this work can be consolidated into one or two Java packages, which is a primary aim
of
this project. This project will help developers create safe, correct s
of
tware to deal with common problem

UOMo
adds Units of Measurement support for IT Systems and Services both to common programming languages like Java and Data Exchange standards like UCUM and formats including UnitsML, SensorML or MathML.
The goal of Project UOMo is to combine what OHF UCUM archieved plus generic Units of Measure support in the spirit of OSGi Measurement, JSR-256 or UCAR/JSR-108 adding Static Type Safety like "Smart" Data or JScience/JSR-275.

Proposals
UOMo
This page is deprecated and may contain some information that is no longer relevant or accurate.
UOMo
UOMo
The UOMo project is a proposed open source project under the
Eclipse Technology Project
.
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse community. Please send all feedback to the
UOMo
Forum.
Background
Developers frequently encounter the need to model units
of
measurement, because objects in the real world are subject to these measures. When working with units, developers need to understand the mathematics
of
units, how to convert between systems, and how to format and parse string representations
of
units. Most
of
this work can be consolidated into one or two Java packages, which is a primary aim
of
this project. This package will help developers create safe, correct s
of
tware to deal with common problem
of
modeling units.
Scope
The scope of the UOMo project is to host a variety of implementation activities related to UCUM or other unit-related standards like UnitsML or MathML:
Unit Standards
Basic implementation of
UCUM
Logic for use in any context
Help to incorporate units into
W3C
standard
MathML
Support
OASIS
standard
Units Markup Language (UnitsML)
Implementing Units of Measurement API
Strong Unit Typing (Compile time support)
Project Plan - | The Eclipse Foundation
Skip to main content
Log in
Financial API based on general Units of Measurement implementation
The focus of the project is on
Java
implementations, but other languages both on the JVM or outside will be supported as appropriate, desired and/or contributed.

The goal of Project UOMo is to combine what OHF UCUM archieved plus generic Units of Measure support in the spirit of OSGi Measurement, JSR-256 or UCAR/JSR-108 adding Static Type Safety like "Smart" Data or JScience/JSR-275.
UOMo stands for UnitsOfMeasure.org, home to UCUM or UnitsOfMeasurement.org, hosting the Units of Measurement API. Uomo also means "man" or "human" in Italian. And given that NASA and other Space Agencies rely on Type Safe Units of Measure APIs after serious and costly incidents in lack of those, his (Italian) words are probably the best argument:
"Questo è un piccolo passo per l'uomo ... uno ... balzo gigantesco per l'umanità"
(Neil Armstrong, July 21st, 1969)
Relationship with other Projects
Equinox
: From the infrastructure point of view parts of UOMo consist of OSGi Bundles and so may be used within the Equinox system. Within OSGi parts of the OUMo project attention will be paid to ensure complete compatibility with Equinox at all times.
ICU4J
: Although not an Eclipse project by itself, the standard library for Unicode, software globalization and i18n. All Static Type Safe Unit implementations are based on ICU4J. So will be all globalization and i18n within the project.
Apache Harmony
also uses ICU4J as the basis for Java standard types like implementations of
java.util.Date

Currency
. This means, it is compatible with equivalent UOMo types. Allowing conversion and calculations between those. Harmony in all shapes and sizes (from Embedded to Enterprise Server) has ICU4J built-in already.
Other users of ICU4J, like Google App Engine, GWT or Google Finance for Java may equally profit from such compatibilities.
Units of Measurement API
: A lean, Static Type Safe Java Unit-API (unitsofmeasurement.org) is used as the only non Eclipse.org dependency beside ICU4J. It provides full compatibility across different Java implementations e.g. with JScience or GeoAPI.
Eclipse Modeling
: The Type Safe Units of Measure support may be used by selected EMF projects for modeling among other fields of use for measurements. Some modeling projects like
AMP
have already expressed their interest.
Test and Performance Tools Platform
:
Project Parfait
, a performance monitoring library for Java demonstrates impressingly how JSR-275, important ancestor to Unit-API can be used for performance monitoring, analysis and reports. Using those features in Unit-API through UOMo can give TPTP similar power. And would allow its exchange of performance results with Parfait or compatible performance monitoring tools.
Mylyn
: Interested in ways to improve time estimation and arithmetics or conversion to other time units (e.g. Story points), considering the notion of a task to be tightly coupled to time and date units, as in Mylyn ITask API.
Xtext
: Groovy or Fantom have demonstrated real live use cases for DSLs, in the Healthcare/Pharma or any other business where exact measurment is crucial. Using libraries which influenced this projects or lead to its Static Type Safe Java API, it may be used together with building blocks for DSLs like Xtext for any equivalent purpose.

STEM/OHT
: Healthcare projects both inside Eclipse Foundation and those affiliated on the outside rely on UCUM even more. HL7 or DICOM are just 2 of the most popular healthcare standards relying on UCUM as a Measurement meta-standard.
DICOM projects like mint (Medical Image Network Transport) at
EclipseLabs
also can profit from UCUM implementation support.
GEF/RAP/UI/E4
: Units of Measure may be used e.g. for Layout Managers, demonstrated by MigLayout for SWT.
WTP
: XML support, especially
Vex
shall be extended to support unit-related markup languages like UnitsML or MathML. Also UCUM support for Enterprise applications and services.
OFMP:
Although little has moved in this sector for those areas ready to use Eclipse technologies this project can lay foundations for Financial applications like Currency Exchange. JScience or Google Financials (based on ICU4J) have demonstrated this. As it is based on both ICU4J and the same Java API, it's be compatible with
both
to some extent.

Eclipse Digital Cockpit
The Eclipse Digital Cockpit provides an Edge Runtime focused on industrial automation. It stands somewhere between a simple Edge Runtime, an "Android for the machine" and a lightweight "Application Server" where services and Apps can be deployed to.
Besides the Edge Runtime there are multiple backends like an App Store (under development) or a Telemetry Backend which takes telemetry values that Apps or Services from the Cockpit send out.
Most importants services for common concerns are
Sparkplug
Define an MQTT Topic Namespace
The intent of the Sparkplug specification is to define and document a Topic Namespace that is well thought out and optimized for the SCADA/IIoT solution sector.
Define an MQTT Payload
The intent of the Sparkplug specification is to strive to define payload encoding architectures that remain true to the original, lightweight, bandwidth efficient, low latency features of MQTT while adding modern encoding schemes targeting the SCADA/IIoT solution sector.
Eclipse WaSP
Eclipse WaSP implements Jakarta Pages, a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types.
Eclipse LSP4MP - Language Server for Eclipse MicroProfile
A language server implementation based on the Language Server Protocol for Eclipse MicroProfile programming model. This Language Server for Eclipse MicroProfile (LSP4MP) will provide core language support capabilities (such as code complete, diagnostics, quick fixes) to enable developers to easily and quickly develop cloud-native applications using MicroProfile APIs.
