What is it?
UOMo adds Units of Measurement support to IT Systems for Data and Services.
This project has been provisioned. You can see the proposal
here
Motivation
Developers frequently encounter the need to model units of measurement, because objects in the real world are subject to these measures. When working with units, developers need to understand the mathematics of units, how to convert between systems, and how to format and parse string representations of units. Most of this work can be consolidated into one or two Java packages, which is a primary aim of this project. This project will help developers create safe, correct software to deal with common problem of modeling units.
Data
Basic implementation of UCUM System for use in any context
Help to incorporate units into W3C standard MathML
Support OASIS standard Units Markup Language (UnitsML)
Services
Strong Unit Typing (Compile time support)
HL7 Services
Financial API based on general Units of Measurement implementation
The focus of the project is on Java implementations, but other languages both on a JVM or other platforms will be supported as appropriate, desired and/or contributed.
... and more ...

History
UOMo
UOMo adds Units of Measurement support for IT Systems and Services both to common programming languages like Java and Data Exchange standards like UCUM and formats including UnitsML, SensorML or MathML.
The goal of Project UOMo is to combine what OHF UCUM archieved plus generic Units of Measure support in the spirit of OSGi Measurement, JSR-256 or UCAR/JSR-108 adding Static Type Safety like "Smart" Data or JScience/JSR-275.
Why the name UOMo?
UOMo stands for UnitsOfMeasure.org, home to UCUM or UnitsOfMeasurement.org, hosting the Units of Measurement API.
Uomo also means "man" or "human" in Italian.
Uomo Vitruviano, the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci was created in honour of ancient Roman architect Vitruvius, illustrating based on his publications how to measure ideal human proportions[1]
Given that NASA and other Space Agencies rely on Type Safe Units of Measure APIs after serious and costly incidents in lack of those, one of their greatest hero's
(Italian) words are another great argument:
"Questo è un piccolo passo per l'uomo ... uno ... balzo gigantesco per l'umanità"
(Neil Armstrong, July 21st, 1969)

UOMo

UOMo adds Units of Measurement support for IT Systems and Services both to common programming languages like Java and Data Exchange standards like UCUM and formats including UnitsML, SensorML or MathML.
The goal of Project UOMo is to combine what OHF UCUM archieved plus generic Units of Measure support in the spirit of OSGi Measurement, JSR-256 or UCAR/JSR-108 adding Static Type Safety like "Smart" Data or JScience/JSR-275.
Why the name UOMo?
UOMo stands for UnitsOfMeasure.org, home to UCUM or UnitsOfMeasurement.org, hosting the Units of Measurement API.
Uomo also means "man" or "human" in Italian.
Uomo Vitruviano, the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci was created in honour of ancient Roman architect Vitruvius, illustrating based on his publications how to measure ideal human proportions[1]
Given that NASA and other Space Agencies rely on Type Safe Units of Measure APIs after serious and costly incidents in lack of those, one of their greatest hero's
0.6.1 | projects.eclipse.org
(Italian) words are another great argument:
"Questo è un piccolo passo per l'uomo ... uno ... balzo gigantesco per l'umanità"
(Neil Armstrong, July 21st, 1969)

UOMo
UOMo
The UOMo project is a proposed open source project under the Eclipse Technology Project.
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the UOMo
Forum.
Background
Developers frequently encounter the need to model units of measurement, because objects in the real world are subject to these measures. When working with units, developers need to understand the mathematics of units, how to convert between systems, and how to format and parse string representations of units. Most of this work can be consolidated into one or two Java packages, which is a primary aim of this project. This package will help developers create safe, correct software to deal with common problem of modeling units.
Scope
The scope of the UOMo project is to host a variety of implementation activities related to UCUM or other unit-related standards like UnitsML or MathML:

Unit Standards
Basic implementation of UCUM Logic for use in any context
Help to incorporate units into W3C standard MathML
Support OASIS standard Units Markup Language (UnitsML)
Implementing Units of Measurement API
Strong Unit Typing (Compile time support)
Financial API based on general Units of Measurement implementation
The focus of the project is on Java implementations, but other languages both on the JVM or outside will be supported as appropriate, desired and/or contributed.
Description
The goal of Project UOMo is to combine what OHF UCUM archieved plus generic Units of Measure support in the spirit of OSGi Measurement, JSR-256 or UCAR/JSR-108 adding Static Type Safety like "Smart" Data or JScience/JSR-275.
UOMo stands for UnitsOfMeasure.org, home to UCUM or UnitsOfMeasurement.org, hosting the Units of Measurement API. Uomo also means "man" or "human" in Italian. And given that NASA and other Space Agencies rely on Type Safe Units of Measure APIs after serious and costly incidents in lack of those, his (Italian) words are probably the best argument:
"Questo è un piccolo passo per l'uomo ... uno ... balzo gigantesco per l'umanità"
(Neil Armstrong, July 21st, 1969)
Relationship with other Projects
Equinox: From the infrastructure point of view parts of UOMo consist of OSGi Bundles and so may be used within the Equinox system. Within OSGi parts of the OUMo project attention will be paid to ensure complete compatibility with Equinox at all times.
ICU4J: Although not an Eclipse project by itself, the standard library for Unicode, software globalization and i18n. All Static Type Safe Unit implementations are based on ICU4J. So will be all globalization and i18n within the project.
Apache Harmony also uses ICU4J as the basis for Java standard types like implementations of java.util.Date or Currency. This means, it is compatible with equivalent UOMo types. Allowing conversion and calculations between those. Harmony in all shapes and sizes (from Embedded to Enterprise Server) has ICU4J built-in already.
Other users of ICU4J, like Google App Engine, GWT or Google Finance for Java may equally profit from such compatibilities.
Units of Measurement API: A lean, Static Type Safe Java Unit-API (unitsofmeasurement.org) is used as the only non Eclipse.org dependency beside ICU4J. It provides full compatibility across different Java implementations e.g. with JScience or GeoAPI.

Eclipse Modeling: The Type Safe Units of Measure support may be used by selected EMF projects for modeling among other fields of use for measurements. Some modeling projects like AMP have already expressed their interest.
Test and Performance Tools Platform: Project Parfait, a performance monitoring library for Java demonstrates impressingly how JSR-275, important ancestor to Unit-API can be used for performance monitoring, analysis and reports. Using those features in Unit-API through UOMo can give TPTP similar power. And would allow its exchange of performance results with Parfait or compatible performance monitoring tools.
Mylyn: Interested in ways to improve time estimation and arithmetics or conversion to other time units (e.g. Story points), considering the notion of a task to be tightly coupled to time and date units, as in Mylyn ITask API.
Xtext: Groovy or Fantom have demonstrated real live use cases for DSLs, in the Healthcare/Pharma or any other business where exact measurment is crucial.
Using libraries which influenced this projects or lead to its Static Type Safe Java API, it may be used together with building blocks for DSLs like Xtext for any equivalent purpose.
STEM/OHT: Healthcare projects both inside Eclipse Foundation and those affiliated on the outside rely on UCUM even more. HL7 or DICOM are just 2 of the most popular healthcare standards relying on UCUM as a Measurement meta-standard.
DICOM projects like mint (Medical Image Network Transport) at EclipseLabs also can profit from UCUM implementation support.
GEF/RAP/UI/E4: Units of Measure may be used e.g. for Layout Managers, demonstrated by MigLayout for SWT.
WTP: XML support, especially Vex shall be extended to support unit-related markup languages like UnitsML or MathML. Also UCUM support for Enterprise applications and services.
OFMP: Although little has moved in this sector for those areas ready to use Eclipse technologies this project can lay foundations for Financial applications like Currency Exchange. JScience or Google Financials (based on ICU4J) have demonstrated this. As it is based on both ICU4J and the same Java API, it's be compatible with both to some extent.
SMILA: Ontology Services like that used by SMILA heavily rely on context and type safe RDF data. For Units of Measure UCUM is the most widely accepted standard for such RDF markup.
Initial Contribution
The initial code contribution will consist of the following components:
The UCUM component as currently present in the OHF project
The Static Type Safe Units Implementation based on ICU4J and Units of Measurement API
contributed by Werner Keil, Ikayzo and others
with help and inspiration from "Smart" Data by Paul Morrison
further input and concepts provided by Peter Kriens based on OSGi Measurement

Eclipse LSP4Jakarta, the Language Server for Jakarta EE
A language server implementation based on the Language Server Protocol for the Jakarta EE programming model. This LSP4Jakarta (Language Server for Jakarta EE) will provide core language support capabilities (such as code complete, diagnostics, quick fixes) to enable developers to easily and quickly develop cloud-native applications using the Jakarta EE APIs.
The Eclipse client for the Language Server for Jakarta EE will surface the capabilities provided by the language server to developers using the Eclipse (desktop) IDE.
Eclipse Scenario Architect
Eclipse EdiTDor
The tool will be developed using web technologies in a way that allows to easily integrate and embed it into other web applications. The tool will cover the following features:
Creating a new Thing Description (Template) from scratch
Rendering a Thing Description (Template)
Editing the Thing Description (Template)
Validating the Thing Description (Template)
Exporting the Thing Description (Template) from the visual representation into JSON-LD
Eclipse Digital Cockpit
The Eclipse Digital Cockpit provides an Edge Runtime focused on industrial automation. It stands somewhere between a simple Edge Runtime, an "Android for the machine" and a lightweight "Application Server" where services and Apps can be deployed to.
Besides the Edge Runtime there are multiple backends like an App Store (under development) or a Telemetry Backend which takes telemetry values that Apps or Services from the Cockpit send out.
Most importants services for common concerns are
Sparkplug
Define an MQTT Topic Namespace
The intent of the Sparkplug specification is to define and document a Topic Namespace that is well thought out and optimized for the SCADA/IIoT solution sector.
Define an MQTT Payload
The intent of the Sparkplug specification is to strive to define payload encoding architectures that remain true to the original, lightweight, bandwidth efficient, low latency features of MQTT while adding modern encoding schemes targeting the SCADA/IIoT solution sector.
Eclipse WaSP
Eclipse WaSP implements Jakarta Pages, a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types.
