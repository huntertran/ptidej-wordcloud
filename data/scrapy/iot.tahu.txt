Eclipse Tahu addresses the existence of legacy SCADA/DCS/ICS protocols and infrastructures and provides a much-needed definition of how best to apply MQTT into these existing industrial operational environments.
Basic network architecture:
Tahu is currently addressing the following features required for MQTT centric IIoT:
Well-defined MQTT Topic Namespace applicable for the IIoT market
In order to be interoperable across the plethora of OEM device manufacturers of industrial equipment and the SCADA/HMI/Control/Cloud Services backend components that desired to subscribe to the resulting information a well-defined MQTT topic namespace needs to be defined. The topic namespace needs to be both efficient yet applicable to the applications that currently exist in the industrial market. The topic namespace needs to provide both the contextual information all the way to an individual device in the field, but also provide topic “verbs” to efficiently manage the “life cycle” of an MQTT session.
Efficient MQTT payload definition
Staying with the original intent of MQTT, the payload specification needs to stay “lean and mean” to best utilize low bandwidth networks (VSAT, Radio, Cellular). Not only does the payload need to be efficient, it needs to recognize the fact that the primary purpose of IIoT solutions is to provide Industrial Process Variable information from devices in the field to both SCADA/DCS/FCS OT solutions as well as line of business IT solutions.
MQTT STATE Management definition
MQTT has the awareness of the current MQTT session built in using the LWT feature. But for STATE aware OT applications like SCADA/DCS/FCS, there needs to be a succinct definition on how best to use MQTT’s built in STATE awareness in an overall SCADA/DCS/ICS infrastructure.
The Sparkplug specification provides all of the definitions and requirements listed above. In addition to the Sparkplug specification, Tahu will provide the required libraries and reference implementation code following the Sparkplug specification in:
C
Java
Javascript
Python
Tutorials on getting the reference implementation code running on popular open hardware platforms like the Raspberry Pi will also be included in Tahu.

Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

Scope:
The scope of the Eclipse Tahu project consists of three major components:
The Sparkplug Specification - This document describes the MQTT topic namespace, the payload-encoding scheme, and the required flow of messages, which ensure state of data originating from an edge device reporting to a backend/central application.
Client library implementations initially in the following programming languages:
C
Java
Javascript
Python
Reference implementations of Sparkplug applications using the client libraries.
