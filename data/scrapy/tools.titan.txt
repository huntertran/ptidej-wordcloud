Eclipse Titan is a TTCN-3 compilation and execution environment with an Eclipse-based IDE
.
TTCN-3 is a
modular language specifically designed for testing (the acronym itself stands for Test and Test Conformance Notation), standardized by ETSI (see
www.ttcn-3.org
) and endorsed by ITU.
The user of the tool can develop test cases, test execution logic and build the executable test suite for several platforms.
Titan consists of a core part, executing in a Unix/Linux-like environment and a set of Eclipse plug-ins.
Titan
Titan compiles and executes test cases. It has four major roles:
*
The TTCN-3
design environment provides
an efficient way to create the TTCN-3 test suites (called the abstract test suite, ATS). The IDE is Eclipse‑based and is called Titan Designer.
It has editors
that provide the usual IDE features
for TTCN-3, ASN.1 and the Titan runtime configuration file. Like creating and configuring Titan projects, syntax highlighting, name convention checking, jump to definition, on-the-fly syntax and semantic analysis, simple content assist, outline of the module
s, mark occurrences etc. ASN.
1 and XSD sources are typically not created by testers, but are coming from specifications. Nevertheless Titan contains a full-featured ASN.1 editor. XSD sources can be viewed, edited and validated by using any
Eclipse
XML editors capable of validating XSD.
The Designer also allows building the project. It has a built-in Makefile generator for GNU and GCC makes and allows setting Titan compiler and GCC compiler and linker flags. The source code is first compiled by the Titan compiler to C++ code, then external C++ compiler and linker are called to build the executable file (which is called the host controller -
HC
). The whole building process is invoked and controlled by the Designer and is running in a command line shell in the background .
*
The Titan compiler builds an
executable test suite
(
ETS
) from the ATS, the test port code (see below) and the Titan runtime library. The ETS is not always directly executable as the TTCN-3 language and Titan allows very flexible runtime parameterization of the test cases (e.g. IP addresses, port numbers etc. in the lab); the values of runtime parameters need not be defined in development time - though default values can be specified-, but they can be provided just before the test execution session. In this way flexible execution scenarios can be created without re-building the ETS;
*
Titan
runtime control
has several tasks:
- the Titan
Main Controller (MC)
read and distributes to all test components the runtime configuration parameters;
- it controls the execution of test cases in a distributed multiplatform environment;
- it keeps up and running the test system: in case of a runtime error, Titan runtime control cleans up the test system, assigns an "error" verdict to the given test case and starts execution of the next test case);
- it produces logs in different formats; Titan has a logging API and
logging
is done via plugins. Currently we have plugins for Titan’s own textual log format and for Jenkins
(junit format)
. Thus, developing a new logging plugin, e.g. for LTTng doesn’t require much
knowledge
of Titan's
code
. S
everal logging mechanisms may be activated at the same time. L
ogging can be configured by verbosity and by event types. Logs can be written into files or be send to another process or via a network connection to a 3
rd
party tool
.
Titan contains two MC implementations: a command line MC and an MC implemented in the Titan Executor Eclipse plugin.
*
Command line
log post-processing utilities
and the Eclipse-based Titan
LogViewer
help analyzing the test results. These tools currently
process Titan's own log format only.
In a model-based testing (MBT) scenario, the test cases generated from the model are necessarily abstract, as the model itself does not contain low level information. Therefore the abstract test cases has to be completed by a test harness, to become executable test cases. TTCN-3 and Titan
in several projects
have proved
to be
an ideal platform for
developing
the test harness, for integrating the generated abstract test cases with the test harness and the test environment, and for test execution
.
Though Titan is told to be "a TTCN-3 test tool", in fact it is able to use TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD and IDL specifications describing the message and signal
structures at the tested interfaces. ASN.1 is imported directly, while XSD and IDL are first converted to TTCN-3 and then the generated TTCN-3 modules are used in the projects. In case of XSD the TTCN-3 module is decorated with XML encoding instructions. Titan also supports codec control decorators in TTCN-3 files for binary and textual protocol encodings. Defining the test configurations and the dynamic behaviour of the tests are written in TTCN-3. Functions written in C/C++ can be also be called in the TTCN-3 code.
Titan consists of the following components, these are all subject of this project:

Test Ports
The TTCN-3 code is generic: the interfaces between the tester and the tested entity (SUT, AUT etc.) are specified at the level of the exchanged abstract data messages and signals.
S
etting up and maintaining the transport connections, and sending/receving "real" messages and signals are the tasks of interface adaptors.
Adaptors are called test ports (TPs) and are plugins written in C++
. Titan has a C++ API for adaptors that complete the ATS with the connectivity layer(s) between the test system and the SUT.
Titan test port (adaptors) included into this project proposal provide the following capabilities:
Name
Function
Implementation language
TCP
Provides communicatin over TCP-type connections in IP networks. It uses the Absrtact Socket library, therefore its supports the features of the Abstract Socket described below. Connections can be static for the time of the test case (opened/starts listening at the TTCN-3 map operation and closed at unmap) or can be opened/closed dynamically from the TTCN-3 code. Multiple TCP connections are supported by one port instance.
C++
UDP
Provides UDP-type connections
in IP networks
. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's UDP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port can handle multiple UDP connections.
C++
TELNET
Allows using remote telnet login from TTCN-3 via the TCP layer of the operating system. The test port supports client and server mode operation. In server mode operation the Telnet Test Port can handle one connection simultaneously. Supports the capabilities of Network Virtual Terminal. Telnet connection parameters (login creadentials, terminal type, prompt format with or without wildcards etc.) can be configured in Titan's runtime configuration file.
C++
SQL
The SQL test port executes SQL statement against the SQL database. The SQL test port is able to handle different SQL engines and databases, and provides an unified interface towards them. Currently MySQL, SQLite C API-s are supported (and required from the database).
C++
PIPE
The PIPE test port is developed to execute shell commands from the TTCN-3 test suite. It provides abstract service primitives to communicate with the user. The stdin, stdout and stderr of the process are returned to the user.
C++
SCTP
ProvidesSCTP-type connections
in IP networks
. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's SCTP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port instance can handle multiple SCTP connections in either server or client mode.
C++
HTTP
Allows sending and receiving HTTP messages between the test suite and SUT via a TCP/IP connection. It uses the Abstract Socket library. Both IP version 4 and 6 are supported and it can handle multiple connections.
C++
PCAP
The PCAP test port has basically two operating modes.
In reading mode
, it is able to process recorded network traffic, saved in a file in libpcap format (used e.g. also by the open source Wireshark tool), and decode various application layer protocol messages. These messages are then delivered to TTCN-3.
In capturing mode
the test port can be used to capture Ethernet packets to a file, controlled from the TTCN-3 environment.
Filtering of messages can be set both at capturing and reading modes.
C++
LANL2
Allows communicating with the SUT at the low level Ethernet connectivity. The test port translates the LANL2 service primitives (ASPs) and messages (PDUs) sent from the TTCN-3 code to Ethernet II frames when sending and translates the received packets to LANL2 ASPs att receipt. The test port uses the Packet Socket on Linux and the DLPI interface on Solaris (using DLIOCRAW mode).
C++
SIP
Handles SIP connections; The test port can handle SIP request and SIP response messages and it can use both UDP and TCP connection to send and receive messages. The built in encoder can encode SIP request and SIP response messages and it is possible to send raw and fragmented [28] messages trough the test port. The name of the header can be encoded in short or long format.
In
basic mode
the test port can handle only one TCP connection or one UDP socket. It is not possible to send and receive messages using both protocols at the same time, but the test port can switch between protocols and remote hosts.
In advanced mode
the test port can handle several TCP connections and listen on both UDP and TCP ports at the same time. Each connection is distinguished by the protocol id, remote host name and the remote port number.
The test port used to be compatible with ETSI's SIP type definitions, therefore
ETSI SIP library
could be used with it. ETSI has slightly changed one of its type definition lately, therefore the test port needs to be updated to be compatible with ETSI's
LibSip v2.0
.
C++
Abstract Socket
It is not a test port, but a library that can be used to build test ports that are using the TCP internet protocol connection; it uses the services provided by the UNIX socket interface and implements basic sending, receiving and socket handling routines. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6, client and server modes and also supports SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1secure connections (the used secure protocol is selected during the SSL handshake automatically).
C++
Protocol Modules
Protocol modules implements static data structure and message encoding/decoding, defined in the specification of the given protocol. Protocols are most often
specified by standard bodies for the interfaces, where equipments of different vendors may or need communicate with each other, but of course, interface specifications may also be vendor-specific.
Protocol modules can support both cases and shall be in TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD, or IDL (Corba). JSON support is being developed currently. The protocol modules made available in this project proposal are all defined by IETF and all these specifications are publically available.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 is a high-level, abstract language. The code itself is platform independent (e.g. no integer value range or float precision requirements in the language, these are defined by tool implementations; memory allocation is completely solved by tools).
TTCN-3 is test environment independent. In TTCN-3 only the abstract messages/signals, exchanged between the test system and the tested entity (SUT, AUT, etc.) are defined, the transport layers and connections are provided and handled by the tools. Message/signal encoding (serialization) and decoding (deserialization) is completely done by the tool in the background. The user, if wants, can access the encoded data in TTCN-3, and the encoded data is also logged for debugging purposes. TTCN-3 also allows leaving data open in the source code and providing the actual values at execution time (i.e. typically IP- and other addresses, IDs and passwords, SUT/AUT parameters for automatic test case selection etc.). All this allows executing the test cases, unchanged, on different platforms and in different test environments.
The TTCN-3 language has four major parts:
A rich data/type system
I
t allows describing the messages/signals of practically all possible protocols and APIs.
Except defining data structures in TTCN-3, the language specify the ways of importing other data type/schema languages - as ASN.1, IDL, XSD and currently JSON mapping is being defined, i.e. using them in TTCN-3 test suites without the need of manual conversion. TTCN-3 can also be used as a schema language for XML and JSON (ongoing).
As an extension, Titan also allows adding encoding instructions to TTCN-3 types to automatically encode them in binary (bit-oriented) or (simple) textual forms, XML or JSON (for ASN.1 data BER/CED/DER encodings are supported).
Test configuration
TTCN-3 allows defining multi-process distributed test cases and test execution logic easily (processes are called “test components”). It is the tools' responsibility to deploy and control the test components on the available pool of machines, possibly running different OS-es. The user need not bother about the details (see also the example below). Types of the test components and their interfaces (ports) to other test components and the tested entity are defined in TTCN-3. The number of test component instances and their port connections are controlled from the test case code dynamically, using built-in language statements.
Test dynamic behaviour
TTCN-3 is a procedural programming language specialized for testing. This means that is has the usual programming language features and in addition, constructs needed for testing are built-in the
language. S
ending/receiving messages, checking the content of the incoming messages, alternative test behaviours depending on the response of the tested entity(including no answer), handling timers and timeouts, logging of events, verdict assignment and collection from the different components of the test system and alike.
Test execution control
Test case execution logic and dynamic test selection can be controlled from the TTCN-3 code itself.
TTCN-3 is a dynamically developing language. In 2003, at publication of its first implemented version, it consisted of two documents (core language and operational semantics), 316 pages in total. In 2005, in TTCN-3 edition 3, tool implementation parts and interworking with ASN.1 has been added and the language specification was published in 7 documents, on 846 pages in total. The first version of TTCN-3 edition 4, in 2009, added interworking with IDL and XSD that increased the number of published pages to 948 in 8 documents (two earlier parts had been made historical in edition 4) . From 2010 language extensions for real time and performance testing, configuration and deployment, testing of interfaces with continuous signals and some advanced language features are published in separate language extension documents. Up to now 6 language extension packages have been published and today, in June 2014, the whole language specification consists of 1422 pages in 14 documents. ETSI is securing the maintenance and development of the language by establishing a project team from ETSI members. The project is financed from ETSI budget.
Example
The following TTCN-3 code shows a Hello Word! example, but it doesn't simply prints out the string.
The PTC first matches the received message against the pattern specified by the TTCN-3 template t_expected. "hello world!" in all small, all capital or small with capital first letters are allowed. Whitespaces are allowed (also at the beginning and end of the string), but there shall be at least one space between "hello and "world". Exclamation mark is optional. If this match successful, the
pass
verdict, if unsuccessful, the
fail
verdict is assigned to the test case and the reason is logged (expected/not the expected message has been received plus the message itself).

Test case results are extracted automatically from it and by clicking on a test case, its log is opened either in a graphical or in a textual/tabular form. In the middle window of the upper row the graphical view the fragment of the last execution of TC can be seen, when the string is received by the PTC and the
fail
verdict is assigned. By clicking on the "charstring", its content is opening in a value window that can be seen in the window below the graphical log window and at the same time the source code line producing the log event is highlighted in the TTCN-3 editor (rigth window of the middle row). The left window of the top row allows selecting the test cases/control part to be executed and shows the actual status of test components during test case runs.

5.4.0 Release Review | projects.eclipse.org
Release:
6.3.0
Description:
Information in support of the graduation review:
A working and demonstrable code base with extensible frameworks and exemplary tools
An active framework user (plug-in provider) community.
The received contribution reflect the versatility of the tool itself:
-CANBus test port
-LTTng logger plug-in
-CoAP protocol module additions
An active user community.
The size and activity of the user community can be assessed through the Eclipse Titan forum, which is the main communication channel with our users; questions and observations can be posted here; it is also a media where we post notes and guides about
new or modified features of the tool. Some of these posts have been read by tens of thousands , with a post reaching an audience of nearly 100.000 readers. We also see a continuous stream of downloads of the source code (Github) and published binaries.
An active multi-organization community.
We have seen adopters, users and contributors for many organizations.
Titan became the backbone of several large IoT testing projects:

(This will revert the following bugs: Bug 499963 - The generated Makefile does not make full build
when -j switch is present ; Bug 512688 - makefilegen: Incorrect .c and .cc compiling rule )
• XER: allow anytype to be xer enc/decodable
• JSON 'as value' attribute extended for records/sets with one field and for the anytype
• "make archive" button in Eclipse

Review Information
This release is mainly a corrective release, it introduces no major new features. No backward incompatibilities are to be expected, with maybe one exception we see as a minor risk: the fix for
Bug 533767 - RAW encoder ALIGN(right) is working according of specification of ALIGN(left) (and vice versa) for octetstring
may induce under some unlikely circumstances an incompatible behaviour.
This version has the following new features:
Implement verdict redirect for 'done' statement
• support for "make port" command in Eclipse
• plug-in dependencies have been changed to Jung 2.1, Google Guava 21.0 instead of Jung 2.0 and Apache Common Collections.
• IPL4 test port control from config file has been added
• Protocol module variants from negative testing have been added to MQTT and CoAP

Eclipse Titan 6.6.1 Release Review
Type:
Release
State:
Successful
End Date of the Review Period:
Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.
Wednesday, February 5, 2020
Project:
Eclipse Titan
Release:
6.6.1
* New RAW coding instruction 'FORCEOMIT'
* New JSON attribute 'as map'
* Attribute 'text ... as ...' for JSON
* Adopt Makefilegen for the Debian packaging
* Support for real-time testing in TITAN
(requires support from the test port being used, see reference guide)
Added compiler option '-I', which enables the real-time testing features mentioned here.
The features are disabled by default, and the new keywords ('now', 'realtime' and 'timestamp')
can be used as identifiers again (for backward compatibility).
Also added makefilegen option '-i', which activates this option for the compiler,
and the makefile setting 'enableRealtimeTesting' in the TPD, which does the same thing.
* New flag for xsd2ttcn
-o: generate all definitions into one module (called XSD_Definitions)

Release Type:
”:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/blob/master/usrguide/JavaCodegenExecTutorial.pdf
Note: due to the need to sync the C++ and Java side, a new restriction had to be introduced:
The version of the Eclipse plug-ins has to coincide with the version of the Titan core compiler and executor, else the plug-ins will not work.
This restriction is not present in versions 6.5.0 and earlier.
-
The Eclipse Refactoring plug-in
, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.EclipsePlug-ins/blob/master/org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring/docs/Titanium_Refactoring_Description/Titanium_Refactoring_Description.adoc
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains the follwing new features:
Support for real-time testing in TITAN(continued from 6.5.0)
Extended 'default' JSON attribute for structured types
New command line option '-p' implemented for TTCN binaries (both in single mode and parallel mode), which lists all module parameters
Printing symbolic version in 'compiler -v'
Legitimized compiler option '-0'

* License upgrade to EPL 2.0
* Documentation migrated to asciidoc
* Bugfixes for core, ASN.1, XML, RAW, OER codecs, XSD2TTCN
* New RAW coding instruction 'FORCEOMIT'
* New JSON attribute 'as map'
* Attribute 'text ... as ...' for JSON
* Adopt Makefilegen for the Debian packaging
* Support for real-time testing in TITAN
(requires support from the test port being used, see reference guide)
Added compiler option '-I', which enables the real-time testing features mentioned here.
The features are disabled by default, and the new keywords ('now', 'realtime' and 'timestamp')
can be used as identifiers again (for backward compatibility).
Also added makefilegen option '-i', which activates this option for the compiler,
and the makefile setting 'enableRealtimeTesting' in the TPD, which does the same thing.

Description:
This release introduces two new experimental Eclipse plug-ins:
-The Eclipse Java code generation plug-in
, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/blob/master/usrguide/java_referenceguide/JavaReferenceGuide.adoc
and also: “
Tutorial for the Java code generator and executor of the TITAN Eclipse
”:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/blob/master/usrguide/JavaCodegenExecTutorial.pdf
Note: due to the need to sync the C++ and Java side, a new restriction had to be introduced:
The version of the Eclipse plug-ins has to coincide with the version of the Titan core compiler and executor, else the plug-ins will not work.
This restriction is not present in versions 6.5.0 and earlier.
-
The Eclipse Refactoring plug-in
, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.EclipsePlug-ins/blob/master/org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring/docs/Titanium_Refactoring_Description/Titanium_Refactoring_Description.adoc

Release:
7.1.0
Description:
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains new features and backward incompatible changes.
New features:
On the C side the most important new feature is the support of the Object-Oriented Extension of the TTCN-3 standard (please note, it is a feature in progress with some features still missing as described in the Bugzilla bug 552011).
On the Java side we have greatly improved the processing speed by parallelizing some of the operations to make use of multi-core CPUs:
Titanium code smell checkers will be run in parallel

5.5.0
Description:
This version CRL 113 200/5 R5A (5.5.pl0) has the following new features:
•
clang support in Titan
As an experimental feature we have introduced support for clang 3-8.
Clang comes with the promise of (significantly) reducing the build time , however at the expense of at a reduced execution speed of the generated binary.
This means that we will not recommended it for load generating applications in production phase, but even for these, it can be used during development.
The C++ source code generated and Titan must be compiled with the same version of clang.
We have published Titan built with clang-3.8 for a number of platforms.
(Note: If you need a Titan built with clang for a platform other than published, pls. let us know and we'll see if we can produce it for you;
else, you can build it from scratch yourself based on the source from github:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core)
Makefiles of TTCN-3 projects must be modified by hand as below:
# Your C++ compiler:
# (if you change the platform, you may need to change the compiler)
CXX := clang++-3.8

Issues
The semantic checking of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 modules will be run in parallel (when there is no dependency between the modules)
The syntactic checking (parsing) in case of project hierarchies can be run in parallel on several projects
Also on the Java side we have added support for JSON encoding/decoding.
Backward incomaptible changes:
'omit' matching mechanism is no longer allowed for union fields
To fix a compilation issue in the Java code generator when used with very large modules we had to change where the typedescriptors are generated into the generated code.

Note: due to the need to sync the C++ and Java side, a new restriction had to be introduced:
The version of the Eclipse plug-ins has to coincide with the version of the Titan core compiler and executor, else the plug-ins will not work.
This restriction is not present in versions 6.5.0 and earlier.
-
The Eclipse Refactoring plug-in
, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.EclipsePlug-ins/blob/master/org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring/docs/Titanium_Refactoring_Description/Titanium_Refactoring_Description.adoc
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains the follwing new features:
Support for real-time testing in TITAN(continued from 6.5.0)
Extended 'default' JSON attribute for structured types
New command line option '-p' implemented for TTCN binaries (both in single mode and parallel mode), which lists all module parameters
Printing symbolic version in 'compiler -v'
Legitimized compiler option '-0'
Implementation of the compiler side of map param/unmap param
Colorized compiler error/warning messages

This version CRL 113 200/5 R5A (5.5.pl0) has the following new features:
•
clang support in Titan
As an experimental feature we have introduced support for clang 3-8.
Clang comes with the promise of (significantly) reducing the build time , however at the expense of at a reduced execution speed of the generated binary.
This means that we will not recommended it for load generating applications in production phase, but even for these, it can be used during development.
The C++ source code generated and Titan must be compiled with the same version of clang.
We have published Titan built with clang-3.8 for a number of platforms.
(Note: If you need a Titan built with clang for a platform other than published, pls. let us know and we'll see if we can produce it for you;
else, you can build it from scratch yourself based on the source from github:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core)
Makefiles of TTCN-3 projects must be modified by hand as below:
# Your C++ compiler:
# (if you change the platform, you may need to change the compiler)

Added compiler option '-I', which enables the real-time testing features mentioned here.
The features are disabled by default, and the new keywords ('now', 'realtime' and 'timestamp')
can be used as identifiers again (for backward compatibility).
Also added makefilegen option '-i', which activates this option for the compiler,
and the makefile setting 'enableRealtimeTesting' in the TPD, which does the same thing.
* New flag for xsd2ttcn
-o: generate all definitions into one module (called XSD_Definitions)

Information in support of the graduation review:
A working and demonstrable code base with extensible frameworks and exemplary tools
An active framework user (plug-in provider) community.
The received contribution reflect the versatility of the tool itself:
-CANBus test port
-LTTng logger plug-in
-CoAP protocol module additions
An active user community.
The size and activity of the user community can be assessed through the Eclipse Titan forum, which is the main communication channel with our users; questions and observations can be posted here; it is also a media where we post notes and guides about
new or modified features of the tool. Some of these posts have been read by tens of thousands , with a post reaching an audience of nearly 100.000 readers. We also see a continuous stream of downloads of the source code (Github) and published binaries.
An active multi-organization community.
We have seen adopters, users and contributors for many organizations.
Titan became the backbone of several large IoT testing projects:

• new compiler options:
-J: Compiler (and xsd2ttcn, makefilegen) option to read input files list from a text file
-N: ignore UNTAGGED encoding instruction on top level unions (legacy behaviour)
• support of encvalue/decvalue for ASN.1 types
• implemented: ports with translation capability
• support for concatenation of templates
• implemented 'any from' clause and index redirects with the use of the @index modifier (see standard, chapters 21-23)
• support for dynamic erroneous attributes
• implemented @fuzzy support
•
no support of Solaris binaries from this release of Titan (older versions of course will continue to support Solaris)
• makefilegen more restrictive on name attribute of the referenced project
• makefilegen: remove generated headers dependency from all .c .cc files
(This will revert the following bugs: Bug 499963 - The generated Makefile does not make full build
when -j switch is present ; Bug 512688 - makefilegen: Incorrect .c and .cc compiling rule )
• XER: allow anytype to be xer enc/decodable

Description:
This version CRL 113 200/5 R5A (5.5.pl0) has the following new features:
•
clang support in Titan
As an experimental feature we have introduced support for clang 3-8.
Clang comes with the promise of (significantly) reducing the build time , however at the expense of at a reduced execution speed of the generated binary.
This means that we will not recommended it for load generating applications in production phase, but even for these, it can be used during development.
The C++ source code generated and Titan must be compiled with the same version of clang.
We have published Titan built with clang-3.8 for a number of platforms.
(Note: If you need a Titan built with clang for a platform other than published, pls. let us know and we'll see if we can produce it for you;
else, you can build it from scratch yourself based on the source from github:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core)
Makefiles of TTCN-3 projects must be modified by hand as below:
# Your C++ compiler:
# (if you change the platform, you may need to change the compiler)
CXX := clang++-3.8

Makefilegen will check the version of the C++ compiler used when building Titan and will re-use the same in the generated Makefile.

Compatibility:
Template(present) should accept complement matching:
-M compiler option:
Enforces legacy behavior when matching the value omit. Allows the use of the value omit in template lists and complemented template lists, giving the user another way to declare templates that match omitted fields. If set, an omitted field will match a template list, if the value omit appears in the list, and it will match a complemented template list, if omit is not in the list (the ifpresent attribute can still be used for matching omitted fields). This also affects the ispresent operation and the present template restriction accordingly.

Pre-built binaries are made available for:

Description:
This release is mainly a corrective release, it introduces no major new features. No backward incompatibilities are to be expected, with maybe one exception we see as a minor risk: the fix for
Bug 533767 - RAW encoder ALIGN(right) is working according of specification of ALIGN(left) (and vice versa) for octetstring
may induce under some unlikely circumstances an incompatible behaviour.
This version has the following new features:
Implement verdict redirect for 'done' statement
str2float should handle special float values

Review Information
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains new features and backward incompatible changes.
New features:
On the C side the most important new feature is the support of the Object-Oriented Extension of the TTCN-3 standard (please note, it is a feature in progress with some features still missing as described in the Bugzilla bug 552011).
On the Java side we have greatly improved the processing speed by parallelizing some of the operations to make use of multi-core CPUs:
Titanium code smell checkers will be run in parallel
The semantic checking of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 modules will be run in parallel (when there is no dependency between the modules)
The syntactic checking (parsing) in case of project hierarchies can be run in parallel on several projects
Also on the Java side we have added support for JSON encoding/decoding.
Backward incomaptible changes:
'omit' matching mechanism is no longer allowed for union fields
To fix a compilation issue in the Java code generator when used with very large modules we had to change where the typedescriptors are generated into the generated code.

Scope:
The project aims to provide an Eclipse-based IDE for TTCN-3 based test design and execution environment. The following are within the projects scope:
Provide a complete test design, execution and log analysis environment for TTCN-3 within the Eclipse IDE.
Provide a command line test execution and result reporting interface.
Utilize the TTCN-3 standard.
Analyze TTCN-3 code quality and report metrics, code smells, code structure, all kind of information that helps the users to maintain robust and high quality code.
Assist the users in refactoring their TTCN-3 code.
Allow testing of XML interfaces and applications.
Allow testing of JSON interfaces and developing JSON schemas.
Permit the ingestion of ASN.1 and IDL specifications, describing the messaging and signal structures at the tested interfaces.
U
tilize the capabilities of
other programming languages in TTCN-3 and a
llow
other programming languages to
utilize TTCN-3 and/or Titan's advantages.
keep test cases concentrating on the test behaviour at the higher abstraction level.
Provide runtime features for
distributed, multi-platform and
load-balanced multi-process test execution on
POSIX-based operational systems as Linux, Solaris and Cygwin over Windows.
Provide the features to specify test execution logic, like conditional, looped, repeated execution with different sets of test data etc.
Collect local test verdicts from the distributed processes (test components) of the system and calculate the overall test case verdict.
Provide statistics of attended or unattended test execution sessions.
Generate logs in different possible formats and verbosity during test execution.
Support continuous integration (CI), for example by providing test results for CI tools like Jenkins.
Provide Eclipse-based and command line log collecting and post-processing utilities.
Provide means for high-level test result- and detailed (low-level) log analysis.
Allow viewing logs in different presentation formats, like graphical. tabular/textual etc.
To help start using the toolset, a few popular,
existing
IP-based transports and protocols are also submitted to open source.
The following test ports (see the description section) are included into this proposal:
TCP, UDP, TELNET,
SQL,
PIPE (creating and executing command line shells from TTCN-3), SCTP, HTTP, PCAP (reading wireshark traces into TTCN-3), LANL2 (handling Ethernet frames), SIP, and Abstract Socket (it is not a test port on is own, but a library handling the TCP socket of the Linux kernel; it is used in our test ports and making it easy to develop any new test port that is using TCP).
See more information on the test port's capabilities in the Description section.
The following protocol modules are also included into this proposal:
DHCP, DHCPv6, DNS, DIAMETER, ICMP, ICMPv6, XMPP, RTP, RTSP, SMTP, SNMP.
Any further test ports, protocol modules or generic, non-domain specific libraries, developed by contributors wil be part of this project, as they are technically closely related to the tool (due to using the test port API and message/signal encoding control of Titan).
Eclipse Titan can be used for automated testing by developing test frameworks and test cases manually. But, when
integrating it with modeling tools
Test frameworks are domain-specific and often specific to the system under test (SUT), e.g. through managing the SUT via its management interface or accessing the SUTs internal status and data using embedded components. Sharing of libraries and frameworks developed by (Titan) users and contributors is important to the success of the test system, but due to their domain-specific nature they should not be part of this project but should create other projects, related to this one.

Project:
Eclipse Titan
Creation Review
Proposal:
Eclipse Titan
Parent Project:
Eclipse Tools Project
Background:
ETSI
(European Telecommunications Standards Institute) was specifying the TTCN-3 (Test and Test Control Notation version 3 - note that the name has been changed in a way leaving the abbreviation intact) test language, and it was a natural choice to use it for the new tool's prototype. In 2003 it was decided to replace the earlier TTCN-2 based test toolset by a more modern and powerful one. After a year of investigation, Titan was further developed (TTCN-3 semantic analysis, GUI, ASN.1 support etc. added). and TTCN-2 test suites were completely replaced by TTCN-3. The Titan toolset has been evolving continuously during the last decade, and is now a proven industrial-strength product with over 4000 active licenses.
Titan
This project proposal, will use the current name of the toolset that is well-known within Ericsson.
What Titan is:
Titan is the TTCN-3-based test toolset
widely
used
within Ericsson
, providing Eclipse-based and command line user interfaces, and multi-platform support.
Titan is an
integration and execution environment for test cases generated from models.
Titan supports attended and unattended (nightly) automatic test execution as well as exploratory testing.
Titan can be efficiently used for small testing tasks as well as for huge and complex test scenarios, where the tester has to communicate with the tested entity via many interfaces in a test case, at the same time. A test suite (including a test framework) of about 1M TTCN-3 LOC exists and is being used.
Titan Eclipse components contain approximately 300,000 LOC in Java, the other components contain about 1,600,000 LOC in C++ and other languages (including tests).
What Titan is not?
Titan is not a GUI testing tool.
Titan is not a test tool for low-level high capacity traffic like (Giga)Ethernet, SDH, ATM etc.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 (
Test and Test Control Notation version 3)
is the standard test specification language, developed and maintained by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (
ETSI
). It is also a worldwide standard as has been endorsed by the
ITU-T
without technical changes. ETSI standards and ITU-T's TTCN-3 Recommendations are available for free of charge to
everyone
.
The portal of the TTCN-3 community is at
http://www.ttcn-3.org
.
A rich bibliography of TTCN-3 related papers can be found at
Fraunhofer Fokus's TTCN-3
site and
Bernard Stepien's
website.
What TTCN-3 is:
"The standardized testing language has the look and feel of a regular programming language but without the complexity that such languages often introduce, as it concentrates exclusively on testing. There are many tutorial and courses to learn TTCN-3, as well as a certification program. The standard itself provides examples that demonstrate the usage of the specific features of the language. The aim of TTCN-3 is to provide a well-defined syntax for the definition of tests independent of any application domain. The abstract nature of a TTCN-3 test system makes it possible to adapt a test system to any test environment. This separation significantly reduces the effort required for maintenance allows experts to concentrate on what to test and not on how."
Source:
http://www.ttcn-3.org
/index.php/about/why-use-ttcn3
See more details in the Descriptions section.
What TTCN-3 is not:
TTCN-3 is not a telecom-specific language. It is a generic-purpose test language,
TTCN-3 is suited for a large variety of application domains:
Mobile and fixed-line communications, telecommunication networks (LTE, WiMAX, 3G, TETRA, GSM, ISDN, SS7 etc.)
Broadband technologies (ATM, DSL)
Middleware platforms (WebServices, CORBA, CCM, EJB)
Internet protocols, IP-based networks and applications (SIP, IMS, IPv6, SIGTRAN, XMPP, SOAP and REST based web services and many more)
Smart Cards, ePassport
Automotive (AUTOSAR, MOST, CAN)
TTCN-3 is not object oriented, it is a procedural language. One of the design principles was to specify an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use language.
TTCN-3 is not designed for developing applications, it is a testing language. Nevertheless, several protocols have been implemented with rational limitations in TTCN-3 to bridge the actually tested layer(s) and the truly available transport layers within the test tool.
Standard test suites and libraries
Several standard test suites are available. We have information that TTCN-3 is used e.g. in the automotive industry, however our knowledge is limited to test suites available from 3GPP and ETSI. Test suites for
mobile and fixed-line communication,
Intelligent Transport Services (ITS), ePassport, etc. are available
from these organizations. These are produced for conformance, network integration/end-to-end and interoperability testing.
See more information at
http://www.ttcn-3.org/index.php/downloads/publicts/publicts-etsi
.
Except test suites, ETSI also publishes a number of TTCN-3 libraries for the IP version 6, SIP, Diameter protocols and for ITS. See available libraries at
http://www.ttcn-3.org/index.php/development/devlibraries
Scope:
The project aims to provide an Eclipse-based IDE for TTCN-3 based test design and execution environment. The following are within the projects scope:
Provide a complete test design, execution and log analysis environment for TTCN-3 within the Eclipse IDE.
Provide a command line test execution and result reporting interface.
Utilize the TTCN-3 standard.
Analyze TTCN-3 code quality and report metrics, code smells, code structure, all kind of information that helps the users to maintain robust and high quality code.
Assist the users in refactoring their TTCN-3 code.
Allow testing of XML interfaces and applications.
Allow testing of JSON interfaces and developing JSON schemas.
Permit the ingestion of ASN.1 and IDL specifications, describing the messaging and signal structures at the tested interfaces.
U
tilize the capabilities of
other programming languages in TTCN-3 and a
llow
other programming languages to
utilize TTCN-3 and/or Titan's advantages.
keep test cases concentrating on the test behaviour at the higher abstraction level.
Provide runtime features for
distributed, multi-platform and
load-balanced multi-process test execution on
POSIX-based operational systems as Linux, Solaris and Cygwin over Windows.
Provide the features to specify test execution logic, like conditional, looped, repeated execution with different sets of test data etc.
Collect local test verdicts from the distributed processes (test components) of the system and calculate the overall test case verdict.
Provide statistics of attended or unattended test execution sessions.
Generate logs in different possible formats and verbosity during test execution.
Support continuous integration (CI), for example by providing test results for CI tools like Jenkins.
Provide Eclipse-based and command line log collecting and post-processing utilities.
Provide means for high-level test result- and detailed (low-level) log analysis.
Allow viewing logs in different presentation formats, like graphical. tabular/textual etc.
To help start using the toolset, a few popular,
existing
IP-based transports and protocols are also submitted to open source.
The following test ports (see the description section) are included into this proposal:
TCP, UDP, TELNET,
SQL,
PIPE (creating and executing command line shells from TTCN-3), SCTP, HTTP, PCAP (reading wireshark traces into TTCN-3), LANL2 (handling Ethernet frames), SIP, and Abstract Socket (it is not a test port on is own, but a library handling the TCP socket of the Linux kernel; it is used in our test ports and making it easy to develop any new test port that is using TCP).
See more information on the test port's capabilities in the Description section.
The following protocol modules are also included into this proposal:
DHCP, DHCPv6, DNS, DIAMETER, ICMP, ICMPv6, XMPP, RTP, RTSP, SMTP, SNMP.
Any further test ports, protocol modules or generic, non-domain specific libraries, developed by contributors wil be part of this project, as they are technically closely related to the tool (due to using the test port API and message/signal encoding control of Titan).
Titan can be used for automated testing by developing test frameworks and test cases manually. But, when
integrating it with modeling tools
Test frameworks are domain-specific and often specific to the system under test (SUT), e.g. through managing the SUT via its management interface or accessing the SUTs internal status and data using embedded components. Sharing of libraries and frameworks developed by (Titan) users and contributors is important to the success of the test system, but due to their domain-specific nature they should not be part of this project but should create other projects, related to this one.
Description:
Titan provides an Eclipse-based IDE for TTCN-3. The user of the tool can develop test cases, test execution logic and build the executable test suite for one or more platforms.
Titan
Titan compiles and executes test cases. It has four major roles:
*
The TTCN-3
design environment provides
an efficient way to create the TTCN-3 test suites (called the abstract test suite, ATS). The IDE is Eclipse‑based and is called Titan Designer.
It has editors
that provide the usual IDE features
for TTCN-3, ASN.1 and the Titan runtime configuration file. Like creating and configuring Titan projects, syntax highlighting, name convention checking, jump to definition, on-the-fly syntax and semantic analysis, simple content assist, outline of the module
s, mark occurrences etc. ASN.
1 and XSD sources are typically not created by testers, but are coming from specifications. Nevertheless Titan contains a full-featured ASN.1 editor. XSD sources can be viewed, edited and validated by using any
Eclipse
XML editors capable of validating XSD.
The Designer also allows building the project. It has a built-in Makefile generator for GNU and GCC makes and allows setting Titan compiler and GCC compiler and linker flags. The source code is first compiled by the Titan compiler to C++ code, then external C++ compiler and linker are called to build the executable file (which is called the host controller -
HC
). The whole building process is invoked and controlled by the Designer and is running in a command line shell in the background .
*
The Titan compiler builds an
executable test suite
(
ETS
) from the ATS, the test port code (see below) and the Titan runtime library. The ETS is not always directly executable as the TTCN-3 language and Titan allows very flexible runtime parameterization of the test cases (e.g. IP addresses, port numbers etc. in the lab); the values of runtime parameters need not be defined in development time - though default values can be specified-, but they can be provided just before the test execution session. In this way flexible execution scenarios can be created without re-building the ETS;
*
Titan
runtime control
has several tasks:
- the Titan
Main Controller (MC)
read and distributes to all test components the runtime configuration parameters;
- it controls the execution of test cases in a distributed multiplatform environment;
- it keeps up and running the test system: in case of a runtime error, Titan runtime control cleans up the test system, assigns an "error" verdict to the given test case and starts execution of the next test case);
- it produces logs in different formats; Titan has a logging API and
logging
is done via plugins. Currently we have plugins for Titan’s own textual log format and for Jenkins
(junit format)
. Thus, developing a new logging plugin, e.g. for LTTng doesn’t require much
knowledge
of Titan's
code
. S
everal logging mechanisms may be activated at the same time. L
ogging can be configured by verbosity and by event types. Logs can be written into files or be send to another process or via a network connection to a 3
rd
party tool
.
Titan contains two MC implementations: a command line MC and an MC implemented in the Titan Executor Eclipse plugin.
*
Command line
log post-processing utilities
and the Eclipse-based Titan
LogViewer
help analyzing the test results. These tools currently
processing Titan's own log format only.
In a model-based testing (MBT) scenario, the test cases generated from the model are necessarily abstract, as the model itself does not contain low level information. Therefore the abstract test cases has to be completed by a test harness, to become executable test cases. TTCN-3 and Titan
in several projects
have proved
to be
an ideal platform for
developing
the test harness, for integrating the generated abstract test cases with the test harness and the test environment, and for test execution
.
Though Titan is told to be "a TTCN-3 test tool", in fact it is able to use TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD and IDL specifications describing the message and signal
structures at the tested interfaces. ASN.1 is imported directly, while XSD and IDL are first converted to TTCN-3 and then the generated TTCN-3 modules are used in the projects. In case of XSD the TTCN-3 module is decorated with XML encoding instructions. Titan also supports codec control decorators in TTCN-3 files for binary and textual protocol encodings. Defining the test configurations and the dynamic behaviour of the tests are written in TTCN-3. Functions written in C/C++ can be also be called in the TTCN-3 code.

Test Ports
The TTCN-3 code is generic: the interfaces between the tester and the tested entity (SUT, AUT etc.) are specified at the level of the exchanged abstract data messages and signals.
S
etting up and maintaining the transport connections, and sending/receving "real" messages and signals are the tasks of interface adaptors.
Adaptors are called test ports (TPs) and are plugins written in C++
. Titan has a C++ API for adaptors that complete the ATS with the connectivity layer(s) between the test system and the SUT.
Titan test port (adaptors) included into this project proposal provide the following capabilities:
Name
Function
Implementation language
TCP
Provides communicatin over TCP-type connections in IP networks. It uses the Absrtact Socket library, therefore its supports the features of the Abstract Socket described below. Connections can be static for the time of the test case (opened/starts listening at the TTCN-3 map operation and closed at unmap) or can be opened/closed dynamically from the TTCN-3 code. Multiple TCP connections are supported by one port instance.
C++
UDP
Provides UDP-type connections
in IP networks
. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's UDP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port can handle multiple UDP connections.
C++
TELNET
Allows using remote telnet login from TTCN-3 via the TCP layer of the operating system. The test port supports client and server mode operation. In server mode operation the Telnet Test Port can handle one connection simultaneously. Supports the capabilities of Network Virtual Terminal. Telnet connection parameters (login creadentials, terminal type, prompt format with or without wildcards etc.) can be configured in Titan's runtime configuration file.
C++
SQL
The SQL test port executes SQL statement against the SQL database. The SQL test port is able to handle different SQL engines and databases, and provides an unified interface towards them. Currently MySQL, SQLite C API-s are supported (and required from the database).
C++
PIPE
The PIPE test port is developed to execute shell commands from the TTCN-3 test suite. It provides abstract service primitives to communicate with the user. The stdin, stdout and stderr of the process are returned to the user.
C++
SCTP
ProvidesSCTP-type connections
in IP networks
. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's SCTP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port instance can handle multiple SCTP connections in either server or client mode.
C++
HTTP
Allows sending and receiving HTTP messages between the test suite and SUT via a TCP/IP connection. It uses the Abstract Socket library. Both IP version 4 and 6 are supported and it can handle multiple connections.
C++
PCAP
The PCAP test port has basically two operating modes.
In reading mode
, it is able to process recorded network traffic, saved in a file in libpcap format (used e.g. also by the open source Wireshark tool), and decode various application layer protocol messages. These messages are then delivered to TTCN-3.
In capturing mode
the test port can be used to capture Ethernet packets to a file, controlled from the TTCN-3 environment.
Filtering of messages can be set both at capturing and reading modes.
C++
LANL2
Allows communicating with the SUT at the low level Ethernet connectivity. The test port translates the LANL2 service primitives (ASPs) and messages (PDUs) sent from the TTCN-3 code to Ethernet II frames when sending and translates the received packets to LANL2 ASPs att receipt. The test port uses the Packet Socket on Linux and the DLPI interface on Solaris (using DLIOCRAW mode).
C++
SIP
Handles SIP connections; The test port can handle SIP request and SIP response messages and it can use both UDP and TCP connection to send and receive messages. The built in encoder can encode SIP request and SIP response messages and it is possible to send raw and fragmented [28] messages trough the test port. The name of the header can be encoded in short or long format.
In
basic mode
the test port can handle only one TCP connection or one UDP socket. It is not possible to send and receive messages using both protocols at the same time, but the test port can switch between protocols and remote hosts.
In advanced mode
the test port can handle several TCP connections and listen on both UDP and TCP ports at the same time. Each connection is distinguished by the protocol id, remote host name and the remote port number.
The test port used to be compatible with ETSI's SIP type definitions, therefore
ETSI SIP library
could be used with it. ETSI has slightly changed one of its type definition lately, therefore the test port needs to be updated to be compatible with ETSI's
LibSip v2.0
.
C++
Abstract Socket
It is not a test port, but a library that can be used to build test ports that are using the TCP internet protocol connection; it uses the services provided by the UNIX socket interface and implements basic sending, receiving and socket handling routines. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6, client and server modes and also supports SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1secure connections (the used secure protocol is selected during the SSL handshake automatically).
C++
Protocol Modules
Protocol modules implements static data structure and message encoding/decoding, defined in the specification of the given protocol. Protocols are most often
specified by standard bodies for the interfaces, where equipments of different vendors may or need communicate with each other, but of course, interface specifications may also be vendor-specific.
Protocol modules can support both cases and shall be in TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD, or IDL (Corba). JSON support is being developed currently. The protocol modules made available in this project proposal are all defined by IETF and all these specifications are publically available.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 is a high-level, abstract language. The code itself is platform independent (e.g. no integer value range or float precision requirements in the language, these are defined by tool implementations; memory allocation is completely solved by tools).
TTCN-3 is test environment independent. In TTCN-3 only the abstract messages/signals, exchanged between the test system and the tested entity (SUT, AUT, etc.) are defined, the transport layers and connections are provided and handled by the tools. Message/signal encoding (serialization) and decoding (deserialization) is completely done by the tool in the background. The user, if wants, can access the encoded data in TTCN-3, and the encoded data is also logged for debugging purposes. TTCN-3 also allows leaving data open in the source code and providing the actual values at execution time (i.e. typically IP- and other addresses, IDs and passwords, SUT/AUT parameters for automatic test case selection etc.). All this allows executing the test cases, unchanged, on different platforms and in different test environments.
The TTCN-3 language has four major parts:
A rich data/type system
I
t allows describing the messages/signals of practically all possible protocols and APIs.
Except defining data structures in TTCN-3, the language specify the ways of importing other data type/schema languages - as ASN.1, IDL, XSD and currently JSON mapping is being defined, i.e. using them in TTCN-3 test suites without the need of manual conversion. TTCN-3 can also be used as a schema language for XML and JSON (ongoing).
As an extension, Titan also allows adding encoding instructions to TTCN-3 types to automatically encode them in binary (bit-oriented) or (simple) textual forms, XML or JSON (for ASN.1 data BER/CED/DER encodings are supported).
Test configuration
TTCN-3 allows defining multi-process distributed test cases and test execution logic easily (processes are called “test components”). It is the tools' responsibility to deploy and control the test components on the available pool of machines, possibly running different OS-es. The user need not bother about the details (see also the example below). Types of the test components and their interfaces (ports) to other test components and the tested entity are defined in TTCN-3. The number of test component instances and their port connections are controlled from the test case code dynamically, using built-in language statements.
Test dynamic behaviour
TTCN-3 is a procedural programming language specialized for testing. This means that is has the usual programming language features and in addition, constructs needed for testing are built-in the
language. S
ending/receiving messages, checking the content of the incoming messages, alternative test behaviours depending on the response of the tested entity(including no answer), handling timers and timeouts, logging of events, verdict assignment and collection from the different components of the test system and alike.
Test execution control
Test case execution logic and dynamic test selection can be controlled from the TTCN-3 code itself.
TTCN-3 is a dynamically developing language. In 2003, at publication of its first implemented version, it consisted of two documents (core language and operational semantics), 316 pages in total. In 2005, in TTCN-3 edition 3, tool implementation parts and interworking with ASN.1 has been added and the language specification was published in 7 documents, on 846 pages in total. The first version of TTCN-3 edition 4, in 2009, added interworking with IDL and XSD that increased the number of published pages to 948 in 8 documents (two earlier parts had been made historical in edition 4) . From 2010 language extensions for real time and performance testing, configuration and deployment, testing of interfaces with continuous signals and some advanced language features are published in separate language extension documents. Up to now 6 language extension packages have been published and today, in June 2014, the whole language specification consists of 1422 pages in 14 documents. ETSI is securing the maintenance and development of the language by establishing a project team from ETSI members. The project is financed from ETSI budget.
Example
The following TTCN-3 code shows a Hello Word! example, but it doesn't simply prints out the string.
The PTC first matches the received message against the pattern specified by the TTCN-3 template t_expected. "hello world!" in all small, all capital or small with capital first letters are allowed. Whitespaces are allowed (also at the beginning and end of the string), but there shall be at least one space between "hello and "world". Exclamation mark is optional. If this match successful, the
pass
verdict, if unsuccessful, the
fail
verdict is assigned to the test case and the reason is logged (expected/not the expected message has been received plus the message itself).

Test case results are extracted automatically from it and by clicking on a test case, its log is opened either in a graphical or in a textual/tabular form. In the middle window of the upper row the graphical view the fragment of the last execution of TC can be seen, when the string is received by the PTC and the
fail
verdict is assigned. By clicking on the "charstring", its content is opening in a value window that can be seen in the window below the graphical log window and at the same time the source code line producing the log event is highlighted in the TTCN-3 editor (rigth window of the middle row). The left window of the top row allows selecting the test cases/control part to be executed and shows the actual status of test components during test case runs.
Why Here?:
Eclipse Foundation is a perfect place for the Titan project for the following reasons:
existing Eclipse IDE, code QA, test execution control and result analysis tools.
the Polarsys project targets robust industry-grade toolset, Titan is such a tool and it targets Polarsys
TTCN-3 and Titan is an ideal target language and tool for model based testing. Modeling support and tools exist in Eclipse, but no support for model based testing (MBT). Titan can complement the existing modeling tools to create a complete MBT environment from modeling to test execution and result (log) evaluation. Such project proposal is being submitted by CEA List, with agreement and co-operation from us.
Initial Contribution:
Initial contribution exists today. It will include a

Legal Issues:
There is no known legal issues with the Titan and test port code or the TTCN-3 language.
Titan
is currently using the following 3
rd
Party libraries (prepequisites):
Name of library License
Editline Library (libedit)
NetBSD
(
http://thrysoee.dk/editline/
)
GNU C Library (glibc)
LGPL
(

)
OpenSSL dual license:

ANTLR BSD (
http://www.antlr.org/license.html
)
Titan uses the bison and the flex tools in binary form, without any source code modification. The output C parser and lexer files, generated by these tools, are compiled to the Titan executable.
Name of the tool License
GNU Bison
GPL for the tool'
s code, but as a special exception, generated files can be used even in non-free products
(
http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Conditions
)
Flex BSD (
http://sourceforge.net/projects/flex/
)
Titan is developed for the POSIX environment, but it is possible to use it on Windows platforms on top of cygwin. In this case (but not in the Linux and Solaris versions), it also uses the runtime library libcygwin.a of cygwin.
Name License
Cygwin By default GPLv3+, but cygwin license contains the following exception clause for using it with open source
SW (see
https://cygwin.com/licensing.html
):
"
Cygwin™ Open Source Licensing Exception
As a special exception to GPLv3+, Red Hat grants you permission to link software whose sources are distributed under a license that satisfies the Open Source Definition with libcygwin.a, without libcygwin.a itself causing the resulting program to be covered by GPLv3+.
This means that you can port an Open Source application to Cygwin™, and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of libcygwin.a linked into it. Note that this does not apply to the Cygwin™ DLL itself. If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of the Cygwin™ DLL, you must adhere to the terms of the GPLv3+, including the requirement to provide sources for the Cygwin™ DLL, unless you have obtained a special Cygwin™ license to distribute the Cygwin™ DLL in only its binary form (see below).
See
http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/
for the precise Open Source Definition referenced above."
Cygwin itself will not be delivered with Titan and will not be kept in the Titan project's repository (with the possible exception of libcygwin.a). It will be the users' responsibility to install the correct version of cygwin, including Cygwin™ DLL, if Titan is used on machines running Windows OS. Therefore this arrangement will fulfill the preconditions of the above exception.
It is possible to build a limited-capability native Windows version of the Titan compiler and xsd2ttcn converter. This version provides syntax and semantic checks of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 sources and converting XSD documents to TTCN-3 modules
only, but doesn't generate C++ code
. Standardization bodies, as 3GPP, like to use this version, as they are developing the code but do not execute the test cases themselves, and many people are using Windows (test cases are verified by members on real implementations and issues found in the test cases are reported back as change requests). In this version of Titan the MINGW 3rd Party library is used:
Name License
MINGW MIT-style (see
http://www.mingw.org/licensel
)
All other code in Titan has been developed by Ericsson from the very beginning.
Titan's help within Eclipse Help contain several links to different external resources (download site of command line components, trouble reporting. links to TTCN-3, ASN.1 and XSD standards etc.). These links will be replaced by their public equivalences when the project is provisioned and the public sites are established. This links require any browser be installed to be able to open the given page, i.e. this forms a
works-with dependency.
"Titan" is a well-known name of the toolset within Ericsson. However, in case the name "Titan" is not acceptable, we have the alternative name proposals:
- Tit@n,
Tit@nium
- TiT3an,
TiT3anium ("3" is not pronounced)
- T3itan,
T3itanium
("3" is not pronounced)
TTCN-3
We hold the following statement from ETSI:
"ETSI has no duty to conduct any research with respect to IPRs encumbering the standards developed by ETSI.
As of June 23rd 2014, ETSI can hereby represent that no ESSENTIAL IPRs as defined in the ETSI IPR policy, have been declared by any ETSI Member in relation with the TTCN-3 standard developed by ETSI.
To the best of ETSI knowledge and as of June 23th 2014, ETSI is not aware of any third parties IPRs which could encumber TTCN 3 and which have not been declared.
ETSI owns no IPR on the TTCN 3 standard."
Test Ports
Some test ports uses 3rd Party libraries as tools as below.
All test ports supporting TCP communication (TCP, HTTP,are using Open SSL. Licensing of Open SLL see at the Titan clause above.
SIP and SQL
They use the Bison and Flex as 3rd Party tools. The test port itself includes the
output C parser and lexer files, generated by these tools, which are compiled into the executable test suite (the HC). Licensing conditions see at the Titan
clause above.
SQL
The
SQL test port also uses the SQLite library (the
sqlite3 development library)
Name of library License
SQLite
Public domain (

LANL2
and
PCAP
These test ports are using the PCAP (libpcap) 3rd Party library (used also by TCPDump, Wireshark, etc.)

Project Scheduling:
The initial contribution is already available. It will be contributed as soon as the project creation process is finished successfully.
Future Work:
Titan will further be developed in Ericsson and the changed and new code be submitted to this project. Other future developments depend on further contributors to the project and their needs.
In parallel with this project proposal, a related project is being proposed by CEA List of the topic "
Model based formal verification and validation
". These two proposals are complementing each other with the aim to create a complete model-based-testing environment, from model specification to test generation, test execution and test result analysis. In the current stage the test cases generated from the model can be integrated with TTCN-3 based test harnesses and be executed using Titan. This will require aligning the code generator's output with the test harness interfaces and/or APIs manually. The two tools are seen by the user as two separate tools currently. We plan closer integration later, but at the point time details are not yet known as the technical discussions are still ahead of us.
We are planning to take several actions to build the community. We plan to announce open sourcing Titan and promote it at the
UCAAT
and
HUSTEF
conferences in September-October 2014. We plan to create a flyer, public website, newsletter and introduction video. Also we are planning to disseminate information about open source Titan in the traditional TTCN-3 community places as the
ttcn-3.org
website, the TTCN-3 article in
Wikipedia
,
LinkedIn
etc. Of course, Eplipse conferences, like EclipseCon Europe 2014, are the natural places to share information and build community. Eclipse Foundation's advice and involvement are welcome.
