zenoh
Zero Overhead Pub/sub, Store/Query and Compute.
zenoh unifies data in motion, data in-use, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
Get started
Eloquent
First class abstractions for
pub/sub
,
storage
,
query
, and
evals
simplify the development of distributed applications, at any scale.
Pub/Sub
zenoh provides efficient publish/subscribe primitives, supporting multiple levels of reliability, dynamic discovery, fragmentation, and wire-level batching.
Storage and Queries
zenoh provides primitives for defining geo-distributed storages as well as well defined semantics for quering and aggregating.
Evaluations
zenoh allows applications to register computations that will be triggered by queries. A simple mechanism that allows many pattern to be implemented, such as RPC and map-reduce.
Learn more
Scalable
The zenoh protocol and its implementations can scale-out as well as scale-down.
Scalable Routing
zenoh provides scale-out through a scalable routing infrastructure that allows your applications to be deployed at Internet scale.
Low Power Networks
zenoh has been designed to run across extremely constrained transports such as LPWAN and LowPAN. To maximise the usable bandwidth, zenoh can run on OSI Layer 2 and has a minimal
wire overhead
of
4 bytes
.
Constrained Devices
zenoh implementations can be extremely resource constrained. Our smallest implementation takes as little as
300 bytes footprint
on an Atmel 8-bit microcontroller.
Learn more
Fast
zenoh is fast to learn and extremely performant.
Fast Adoption
zenoh has a very simple API that makes it extremely fast to get started and productive. API are available for the most popular programming languages and more are added regularly.
Low Latency
zenoh has an extremely low latency, thus it is appropriate for applications that require extremely low overhead and reaction times.
High Throughput
zenoh delivers extremely high throughput and allow you to further its off-the-shelf performance through the batching API.

Installation
Edit on GitHub
To get up and running with zenoh you will have to install the router and then get hold of the API you would like to use to write your applications.
Installing zenoh’s router
At the present stage zenoh’s router is supported only on Linux and MacOS. However, for other platforms, you can use the
Docker image
.
Below are the detailed information on how to install the binaries directly on supported platforms (i.e. without Docker).
MacOS
The first step is to tap our brew package repository:
And simply install zenoh as follows:
Then you can start the zenoh router with this command:
Ubuntu (20.04)
TODO
Testing Your Installation
To test the installation, try to see the zenoh man page by executing the following command:
You should see the following output on your console:
Installing client library
To develop your application zenoh application, you need to install a zenoh client library. Depending your programmation language, choose one of the following API and refer to the installation and usage instructions in here:
Python API
C API (only zenoh-net API)

It would be good also if we could partition the namespaces with routers, so for example "/ns1" and "/ns2" are two separate groups of p2p nodes, and a router that sits between them, and anything that goes from /ns1 to /ns2 automatically goes via the router
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
When you say managed wifi network and the multicast doesn't get past the routers, you referer to an IP router interconnecting two different Layer 2 domains, right?
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
i think so (i have not used the network directly myself)
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
Ok, got it. In that case the Zenoh router would be in a separate subnet and multicast would not work to discover it. This is not something easy to solve since you are segmenting the IP network and discovery protocols work on the same domain. There are different approaches that can be implemented, e.g., DNS-based but they become very deployment-specific. Let me draw something quickly.
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
Using a known URL for the router is acceptable provided it's easily configurable (i.e. not in the source code)
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
So, to rephrase it. What we are doing now is a zeroconf discovery. This works in a LAN because the way multicast is treated. However, zeroconf discovery is not always available depending on the underlying infrastructure.
Yes, the locator of the router can be passed when opening a Zenoh session
if no locator is provided, then it automatically scouts for routers in the zeroconf approach. But you can get your URL from your personal configuration and pass it as a paremeter when opening a session
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
When it scouts for routers, how does it know what they give it access to?
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
At the moment it doesn’t know it. It knows that there is a router and tries to connect to it. No assumptions are made on the key-space accessible through it
The same way when scanning for an Access Point in a wireless network you don’t know a priori what kind of services are provided by that network
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
Is there anything on the roadmap to make that sort of information available?
We'd love to be able to specify what segment of the namespace corresponds to what segment of the IP network
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
It’s not clear to me the rationale behind the mapping between IP network and segment of the namespace, do you mind elaborate it a little bit?
In any case, what can be done is to configure how routers announce themselves, i.e., they can announce themselves as different types of routers if that suffices. In this way you know what kind of router is replying
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
for example, if we have a set of robots, each with its own IP, we'd like to give each robot its own segment of the namespace. Those robots would be on a subnet. On a separate subnet might be the infrastructure of the building, such as smart doors and elevators. Another subnet could have the building next door, joined by a walkway. Or perhaps it's one subnet per floor in a building, depending on the quantity of infrastructure. So we'd like to have a namespace for each floor, namespace for each building (probably a parent of the floor namespaces), and so on. But routers need to be in place to handle traffic going between floors, and between buildings, due to the different subnets.
Where is the documentation on what routers can do and how to configure them?
One of the reasons for doing things this way is we want to limit how far some traffic spreads, while also allowing other traffic to get everywhere. Namely we want things lke sensor data to stay only where that data is relevant, but we want information about what nodes we have, what they are publishing, etc. to be available everywhere for introspection purposes
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
Ok, got it thanks. The segmentation behavior you are referring to is still under development. It is part of a multi-domain routing that we are doing. This would allow to segment and limit the visibility fo some data in a given portion of the network. Nevertheless, Zenoh provides an admin space that allows to introspect what is available. Perhaps
@OlivierHecart
and
@JEnoch
can provide a deeper insight on that...
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
:+1:
Is there any documentation on how to use that admin space?
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
Some example is available here:
http://zenoh.io/docs/apis/apis/
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
Thanks
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
You are welcome!
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
@gbiggs
: if your concern is "only" to limit the traffic (meaning bandwidth usage) for the data to go only where it needs to (i.e. where their are matching subscribers and/or storages), that is already in place in zenoh:
the publications of data are always made in unicast in destination of a matching subscriber (if peer-to-peer) and/or a zenoh router. And that router will route the data only where he knows there is a matching subscriber or storage elsewhere in the system.
Now if your concern is also about access control, to limit access to some namespace segments, that will come later when we’ll add security (encryption + authentication + access-control).
OlivierHecart
@OlivierHecart
@gbiggs
, to summarize what has been discussed :
"closure based scouting" : the ability to discover peers and routers from a first unicast locator entry point is in our plan and should be available soon.
"namespacing" is, as
@JEnoch
mentioned, built-in into zenoh. If no application outside a sub-system is subscribing to some data produced in a sub-system, the data will not be routed outside the sub-system. If you really want to prevent data to get out a sub-system even if there are subscriptions for it outside the sub-system, this is a security concern and will come later.
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
@JEnoch
Security is definitely a concern, but I'm not talking from that perspective. Nor from sending the data, I know it only sends data where it's actually wanted. Our issue is the number of different channels we typically use, and a desire to limit the discovery flood that occurs in DDS through more intelligent mechanisms. The zenoh namespacing seems like one ideal solution to us.
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
I'm having some trouble with zenoh-python that maybe you fine people can help me with.
When I try to run a slight modification of the source at the top of the zenoh-python documentation, I don't get the result I was expecting. I expected to get back a key I'd just put, but instead I get an empty list.
Here's what I run in ipython:
In [1]: import zenoh
In [2]: z = zenoh.Zenoh({})
In [3]: w = z.workspace()
In [4]: w.put('/demo/example/hello', 'Hello world!')
In [5]: w.get('/demo/example/**')
Out[5]: []
In [6]: w.get('/demo/example/hello')
Out[6]: []
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
Hi
@gbiggs
,
Do you have a running zenoh router configured with a memory storage (option: --mem-storage /demo/example/**) ?
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
I do not, no
This sort of thing is why I wish you had some concepts documentation...
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
I guess we need to improve, but at least it’s described here:
http://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/first-app/
Where do you think we would need to add such information (i.e. a storage is required to store data) ?
In python API doc ? In examples comments ?
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
You need a "overview of zenoh" document that gives a detailed description of concepts and how zenoh is expected to be used, in multiple ways if there is more than one way you expect it to be used (for example, with just clients and routers, with just p2p, with a mix of all three, with routing between domains, ...). This is not for any one particular client library but so that people new to zenoh know what entities they are expected to create and how they are expected to use them together to use zenoh correctly
Then you can reference back to that from each client library's documentation
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
Thanks for your feedback! We’ll definitely work on this.
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
Thanks!
Zenoh is awesome and I want to use it more effectively but it's difficult to know where to even begin at the moment due to the different concepts from other middlewares and no information on how to use them correctly.
Related more directly to my problem above, it would be nice if there were some kind of error when I put a key/value and there's nowhere to store it, rather than it silently failing.
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
If one wants a pure pub/sub use case without any storage, that is perfectly valid. We don’t want to raise an error in this case.
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
if it were pure pub/sub then no error would be correct, I think. You publish and forget, so if no one is listening you don't care. But if you are expecting it to be stored somewhere and it is not, then that sounds like something that should give feedback that the expected result (the key/value was stored) has not happened.
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
What we plan for the future is to introduce the concept of quorum.
I.e. I put a value with a quorum of 2, meaning that I expect at least 2 storages to store my data. And I would get an error if less than 2 are storing.
A similar quorum mechanism will be available for get operations, in order to ensure a strong consistency.
In your case, with only 1 storage expected to store your data, you would do the put with a quorum of 1 to get an error in case there is no storage.
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
that sounds like a good way to do it. sort of like QoS for a key/value store
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
Exactly. And that doesn’t add penalty for pub/sub or « fire-and-forget » use cases
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
yeah. If I don't care if it's stored or not then I can use a quorum of zero
Joe Speed
@joespeed
@JEnoch
still have error: 'dds/dds.h' file not found
eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-dds#10
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
That's just Zenoh trying to protect you from the horrors of DDS.
Joe Speed
@joespeed

🤣 if DDS is a horror, then cyclonedds is Casper the Friendly Ghost👻

Eclipse zenoh
The Eclipse zenoh: Zero Overhead Pub/sub, Store/Query and Compute.
Eclipse zenoh unifies data in motion, data in-use, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
As a consequence of the widespread adoption of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and the raise of ed applications, the number of network connected devices is steadily increasingly as is (1) their heterogeneity with respect to computing, storage and communication capabilities, (2) the scale at which they produce and consume data and (3) the need for geo-distributed storage and queries. Thus, data exchange protocols face new needs with respect to vertical and horizontal scalability, support for constrained networks and devices with low duty cycle – in other terms devices that are disconnected/sleeping most of the time as well as ability to deal with both data in motion and data at rest. Protocols used today to build these systems, such as MQTT, DDS, CoAP and HTTP were not designed with these needs in mind. As a result, architects and developers are forced into patchwork design in which multiple protocols are stitched together to provide some meaningful end-to-end semantics. Zenoh's authors have co-invented and built some of the communication infrastructures deployed today as part of telecommunication, aerospace and early Industrial Internet applications (notably DDS). It is with this baggage of experience that they came to the realization that a new protocol was needed – a protocol designed ground-up to address the needs of large scale CPS as well as edge systems end-to-end. Eclipse zenoh, is a stack designed to (1) minimize network overhead – the minimal wire overhead of a data message a data message is 4 bytes, (2) support extremely constrained devices – its footprint on Arduino Uno is of 300 bytes, (3) supports devices with low duty-cycle by allowing the negotiation of data exchange modes and schedules, (4) provide a rich set of abstraction for distributing, querying and storing data along the entire system, and (5) provide extremely low latency and high throughput.

, while retaining a level of
time and space efficiency
that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
Eclipse zenoh will build around the zenoh infrastructure and includes zenoh software routers/brokers as well as the zenoh client APIs.
Description:
Eclipse zenoh provides is a stack designed to (1) minimize network overhead, (2) support extremely constrained devices, (3) supports devices with low duty-cycle by allowing the negotiation of data exchange modes and schedules, (4) provide a rich set of abstraction for distributing, querying and storing data along the entire system, and (5) provide extremely low latency and high throughput.
Why Here?:
Zenoh was deisgned with Edge and Fog Computing in mind thus the Eclipse IoT seems to be the right home for it. Beside, Eclipse fog05 relies entirely on zenoh, thus it would make more sense to have the entire fog05 stack to be powered by Eclipse IoT technologies.
Initial Contribution:
Our intial contribution will include:
Zenoh Router.
The zenoh software router implements a routing infrastructure that allows to run zenoh applications at Internet Scale. Zenoh routers can be connected over arbitrariy graphs and maintain the routing topology through a series of self-stabilising decentralised algorithms.

All the examples are compiled into the
target/release/examples
directory. They can all work in peer-to-peer, or interconnected via the zenoh router (
target/release/zenohd
).
Then, you can test it using the zenoh API in your favorite language:
Rust
using the
zenoh crate
and the
examples in this repo
Python
using
zenoh-python
Or with the
REST
API:

Parent Project:
Eclipse IoT
Background:
As a consequence of the widespread adoption of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and the raise of ed applications, the number of network connected devices is steadily increasingly as is (1) their heterogeneity with respect to computing, storage and communication capabilities, (2) the scale at which they produce and consume data and (3) the need for geo-distributed storage and queries. Thus, data exchange protocols face new needs with respect to vertical and horizontal scalability, support for constrained networks and devices with low duty cycle – in other terms devices that are disconnected/sleeping most of the time as well as ability to deal with both data in motion and data at rest. Protocols used today to build these systems, such as MQTT, DDS, CoAP and HTTP were not designed with these needs in mind. As a result, architects and developers are forced into patchwork design in which multiple protocols are stitched together to provide some meaningful end-to-end semantics. Zenoh's authors have co-invented and built some of the communication infrastructures deployed today as part of telecommunication, aerospace and early Industrial Internet applications (notably DDS). It is with this baggage of experience that they came to the realization that a new protocol was needed – a protocol designed ground-up to address the needs of large scale CPS as well as edge systems end-to-end. Eclipse zenoh, is a stack designed to (1) minimize network overhead – the minimal wire overhead of a data message a data message is 4 bytes, (2) support extremely constrained devices – its footprint on Arduino Uno is of 300 bytes, (3) supports devices with low duty-cycle by allowing the negotiation of data exchange modes and schedules, (4) provide a rich set of abstraction for distributing, querying and storing data along the entire system, and (5) provide extremely low latency and high throughput.
Scope:
Eclipse zenoh provides a stack that
unifies
data
in
motion
, data
in-use
and data at
rest

we already have releases for main streams platforms and our github repositors have been made public (see references below).
Thus we are ready now.
Future Work:
We plan to work on:
- More client API, next two will be Rust and JavaScript
- Next generation Router rewrite in Rust

Build zenoh-python using
maturin
Maturin will automatically build the zenoh Rust API, as well as the zenoh-python API and install it in your Python virtual environement.
Running the Examples
The simplest way to run some of the example is to get a Docker image of the
zenoh
network router (see
https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it
) and then to run the examples on your machine.
Then, run the zenoh-python examples following the instructions in

, while retaining a level of

that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
Eclipse zenoh will build around the zenoh infrastructure and includes zenoh software routers/brokers as well as the zenoh client APIs.
Description:
Eclipse zenoh provides is a stack designed to (1) minimize network overhead, (2) support extremely constrained devices, (3) supports devices with low duty-cycle by allowing the negotiation of data exchange modes and schedules, (4) provide a rich set of abstraction for distributing, querying and storing data along the entire system, and (5) provide extremely low latency and high throughput.
Why Here?:
Zenoh was deisgned with Edge and Fog Computing in mind thus the Eclipse IoT seems to be the right home for it. Beside, Eclipse fog05 relies entirely on zenoh, thus it would make more sense to have the entire fog05 stack to be powered by Eclipse IoT technologies.

A zenoh plug-in that allows to transparently route DDS data. This plugin can be used by DDS applications, such as ROS2 robotic applications and others, to leverage the zenoh for geographical routing or for better scaling discovery.

Eclipse zenoh C Client API
Eclipse zenoh
is an extremely efficient and fault-tolerant
Named Data Networking
(NDN) protocol that is able to scale down to extremely constrainded devices and networks.
The C API is for pure clients, in other terms does not support peer-to-peer communication, can be easily tested against a zenoh router running in a Docker container (see
https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it
).
How to install it
The Eclipse zenoh-c library is available as
Debian
or
RPM
packages in the
Eclipse zenoh download area
. Those packages are built using manylinux2010 x86-32 and x86-64 to be compatible with most of the Linux platforms. There are 2 kind of packages:
libzenohc
: only contains the library file (.so)
zenoh-rust

Zenoh plugin for DDS
, based on the zenoh-c API via JNI.
⚠️
zenoh has been subjet to a complete rewrite with major protocol updates between versions 0.4.2 and 0.5.0. The Java API does not yet integrate those changes and is only compatible with version 0.4.2 of the zenoh daemon and the underlying zenoh-c stack.
Installation
zenoh-java is available on Maven Central. Just add the dependency in your POM:
Building
Requirements:
Java >= 8
Apache Maven >= 3.6.0
SWIG
CMake
make, gcc (for zenoh-c compilation)
Optional for cross-compilation:
Docker
To build for your current platform:
mvn clean install
If zenoh-c is found in the same directory than zenoh-java, the build will copy its sources and compile it. Otherwise, the build will clone the

Background
The Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a standard for data-centric publish subscribe. Whilst DDS has been around for quite some time and has a long history of deployments in various industries, it has recently gained quite a bit of attentions thanks to its adoption by the Robotic Operating System (ROS2) -- where it is used for communication between ROS2 nodes.
Robot Swarms and Edge Robotics
As mentioned above, ROS2 has adopted DDS as the mechanism to exchange data between nodes within and potentially across a robot. That said, due to some of the very core assumptions at the foundations of the DDS wire-protocol, beside the fact that it leverage UDP/IP multicast for communication, it is not so straightforward to scale DDS communication over a WAN or across multiple LANs. Zenoh, on the other hand was designed since its inception to operate at Internet Scale.
Thus, the main motivations to have a
DDS connector
for
zenoh
are:
Facilitate the interconnection of robot swarms.
Support use cases of edge robotics.
Give the possibility to use
zenoh
's geo-distributed storage and query system to better manage robot's data.
Architecture
zenoh
routers provide a plug-in mechanism that allow for extensions to be loaded and activated by its management API. Thus the most natural way to implement a DDS connector for zenoh is to do that as a zenoh router plugin.
zenoh-c
repository and compile it.
Note that this Maven build offers profiles in addition of the default one:
mvn -Pdebug clean install
compiles zenoh-c with debug logs active
mvn -Prelease clean install
compiles zenoh-c in release mode (without logs)
cross-compiles zenoh-c on all supported platforms (incl. MacOS if this is your current host) using
dockross
.
generates the Javadoc
generate a ZIP file for release in assembly/target

Eclipse zenoh Go API
Eclipse zenoh
is an extremely efficient and fault-tolerant
Named Data Networking
(NDN) protocol that is able to scale down to extremely constrainded devices and networks.
⚠️
zenoh has been subjet to a complete rewrite with major protocol updates between versions 0.4.2 and 0.5.0. The Go API does not yet integrate those changes and is only compatible with version 0.4.2 of the zenoh daemon and the underlying zenoh-c stack.
The Go API is for pure clients, in other terms does not support peer-to-peer communication, can be easily tested against a zenoh router running in a Docker container (see
https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it
).

This plugin, will essentially:
Spoof DDS discovery data and transparently expose DDS writers/readers as zenoh publisher/subscribers
Route the data produced by discovered DDS writers to data to matching entities.
Beside the zenoh router plugin we also support a stand-alone bridge called
dzd
that can be used to transparently bridge DDS data on zenoh and viceversa.
Mapping DDS to zenoh
The mapping between DDS and zenoh is rather straightforward. Given a DDS Reader/Writer for topic

Q
, then the equivalent zenoh resource will be named as
P/A/*
. On the other hand actual writes will be on the resource
P/A/sample-key-hash
as this allows for zenoh subscriber to easily subscribe to just a specific Topic instance, a set of them or of all of them.
Trying it Out
In order to get running with the DDS plugin for zenoh you need first to install the following dependencies:
CMake
Your favourite C/C++ Compiler
Rust
Once these dependencies are in place, simply do:
Assuming you want to try this with ROS2, then install it by following the instructions available
here
. Once you've installed ROS2, you easily let ROS applications communicate acros the internet. Notice that in order to really make this work you need to have ROS applications run on different networks. There are different ways of achieving this, you can use containers, VMs, or hosts on different networks.

In any case assuming you have two networks, let's say N1 and N2, you will need to run one instance of
dzd
per network. The
dzd
daemon will operate like a transparent router discovering DDS traffic and forwarding it on zenoh w/o you having to configure anything.
You are also welcome to use the freely available zenoh internet infrastructure to route across the internet, in this case just start one instance of
dzd
per network by running the following command:
The on one of the networks, say N1, start a ROS2 listener by using the following command:
While on N2 starts a ROS2 talker by using the following command:
You will see a stream of ROS2
Hello World
messages streamed across the internet!
Good Hacking!
About
A zenoh plug-in that allows to transparently route DDS data. This plugin can be used by DDS applications, such as ROS2 robotic applications and others, to leverage the zenoh for geographical routing or for better scaling discovery.
