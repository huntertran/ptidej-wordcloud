@JEnoch
Where do you think we would need to add such information (i.e. a storage is required to store data) ?In python API doc ? In examples comments ?
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
You need a "overview of zenoh" document that gives a detailed description of concepts and how zenoh is expected to be used, in multiple ways if there is more than one way you expect it to be used (for example, with just clients and routers, with just p2p, with a mix of all three, with routing between domains, ...). This is not for any one particular client library but so that people new to zenoh know what entities they are expected to create and how they are expected to use them together to use zenoh correctly
Then you can reference back to that from each client library's documentation
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
Thanks for your feedback! We’ll definitely work on this.
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
Thanks!
Zenoh is awesome and I want to use it more effectively but it's difficult to know where to even begin at the moment due to the different concepts from other middlewares and no information on how to use them correctly.
Related more directly to my problem above, it would be nice if there were some kind of error when I put a key/value and there's nowhere to store it, rather than it silently failing.

If one wants a pure pub/sub use case without any storage, that is perfectly valid. We don’t want to raise an error in this case.
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
if it were pure pub/sub then no error would be correct, I think. You publish and forget, so if no one is listening you don't care. But if you are expecting it to be stored somewhere and it is not, then that sounds like something that should give feedback that the expected result (the key/value was stored) has not happened.
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
What we plan for the future is to introduce the concept of quorum.I.e. I put a value with a quorum of 2, meaning that I expect at least 2 storages to store my data. And I would get an error if less than 2 are storing.A similar quorum mechanism will be available for get operations, in order to ensure a strong consistency.
In your case, with only 1 storage expected to store your data, you would do the put with a quorum of 1 to get an error in case there is no storage.
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
that sounds like a good way to do it. sort of like QoS for a key/value store
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
Exactly. And that doesn’t add penalty for pub/sub or « fire-and-forget » use cases
Geoffrey Biggs
@gbiggs
yeah. If I don't care if it's stored or not then I can use a quorum of zero

@kydos
Hello @gbiggs, today the DDS-Plugin for zenoh can be used to enable and scale (1) DDS WAN discovery and (2) DDS WAN Communication. That said, if we consider a Robot as a system in which all internal communication is DDS, then having a DDS-Plugin deployed for each robot would make it possible to use the zenoh routing framework to have scalable and multicast-less discovery.
Angelo Corsaro
@kydos
The DDS plugin for zenoh, could additionally allow to control the set of resources that are exposed to the rest of the world to further reduce the discovery traffic. I’d imagine that there are inevitably readers and writers whose discovery information is propagated whose scope is really local to the robot. Additionally DDS discovery does not allow for generalisation and the DDS reliability protocol requires precise knowledge of all readers/writers. That impacts discovery and local state.
To understand what I mean by resource generalisation, let me give you an example. Assume that a router starts to see subscriptions arriving downstream for resource /foo/bar/a, /foo/bar/b, … The router may decide to generalise this and propagate a single subscription to /foo/bar/*
If we take that to the extreme, for a robot, we could have resource generalalisation and map a full set of ROS topics to a single zenoh resource. Imagine your topics were named something like /robot-id/subsystem-i/data-name-j. We could generalise these topics to a single resource such as /robot-id/* or specific subsystem /robot-id/subsystem-i/
Thus the number of ways in which we can compact the discovery traffic is beyond what DDS provides. Which should result in a zenoh based inter-robot discovery and communication to be more effective.
Angelo Corsaro
@kydos
@gbiggs , I hope this give sufficient context. If that helps we can post this on a slide-deck — just let me know.
GitHub - eclipse-zenoh/zenoh: zenoh unifies data in motion, data in-use, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

@milangroshev
Hi all,Is it possible to query the in memory storage in Zenoh by timestamp ?I would like to get all the data for a given time interval.
Luca Cominardi
@Mallets
Hi Milan, the memory storage is a last-value storage. So it only keeps the last value written to it for any given key. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Do you want to keep multiple values for the same key like in a time series?
Milan Groshev
@milangroshev
Hi Luca, tnx for the reply. Yes i would like to keep multiple values for the same key and query them by timestamp. I am trying to retrieve past history for a given key. For example, query values for past 15 seconds published in a given key.
Julien Enoch
@JEnoch
Hi @milangroshev ,This is not implented in the current memory storage, which keep only the latest value for each key.By the end of this year, we will add an InfluxDB backend that will allow key/values to be stored as time-series.You will also be able to get data by interval with such selector: /demo/examples/**?(start=yesterday;end=now)(Where the time syntax is the same than supported by InfluxDB)

Ok, got it. This is not possible with the memory storage since it adopts a last-value approach where only the last written value is kept. So, there is only one value associated to a key at any given time. In case of having something like a time-series, what is required is to have the InfluxDB backend (not the memory storage). The addition to this backend is on our roadmap but not yet supported
Thanks @JEnoch , our messages crossed.
Milan Groshev
@milangroshev
Thanks a lot @Mallets and @JEnoch for the explanation

@kydos
I have a first version of zero-copy working for zenoh. At the present stage I am experimenting above zenoh-net, but once we are happy with the approach it will be integrated within zenoh-net and allow you to transfer large data w/o any copies!
For those of you that cannot wait, this is the current working writer:
#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let z = open(Properties::default().into()).await.unwrap();
let shm = SharedMemoryManager::new("/tmp/zenoh_shmem_writer".into(), 8192).unwrap();
let mut sbuf = shm.alloc(1024).unwrap();
let bs = sbuf.as_mut_slice();
for i in 0..1024 {

bs[i] = rand::random::<u8>();
}
z.write(&"/zenoh/shm/data".into(), sbuf.into()).await?;
let mut buffer = String::new();
io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer)?;
Ok(())
}
Clearly the initialisation of the shared memory manager will be hidden inside zenoh, thus that step will go away and you won’t have to choose a path either.
Additionally, data will be zero-copy for receiver on the same node will it will follow the usual path for data that needs to cross the network.

No, it is a pure Rust implementation and follows the same ideas of ownership and borrowing...
That said, it will be exposed on all language bindings.
I’ll describe the design on the zenoh github wiki in the following days.

@kydos , I am looking at Berkeley RISELab project: https://github.com/erdos-project, there are two projects: erdos and pylot. ERDOS stands for Elastic Robot Dataflow Operating System, which is a platform for developing self-driving cars and robotics applications. I think it is very early stage compare to ROS2, but it does provide fine tuned dataflow/pipeline with operators / tasks.Pylot is an autonomous vehicle platform for developing and testing autonomous vehicle components (e.g., perception, prediction, planning) on the CARLA simulator and real-world cars.

zenoh unifies data in motion, data in-use, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
I am considering if ERDOS can be built on top of zenoh-net api. By looking at the code, currently ERDOS is using tokio framework. can you take a look? I feel it might be quite easy to build ERDOS over zenoh and such we have a distributed dataflow/pipeline
Yong He
@heyong4725
If you look at Baidu/Apollo Autonomous Driving stack, they modified ROS1, plus adopted some Spark dataflow/pipeline components, such that they can build/drive a DAG graph/tasks. That is exactly what ERDOS is trying. By building ERDOS over zenoh, we can have a geo-distributed dataflow/pipeline.
Of course, ERDOS is still at very early stage, but the concepts are worth exploring. Let's discuss it next week @kydos

Check the website zenoh.io for more detailed information.
How to build it
Install Cargo and Rust. Currently, zenoh requires a nightly version of Rust, type the following to install it after you have followed the previous instructions:
$ rustup default nightly
And then build zenoh with:
$ cargo build --release --all-targets
How to test it
For convenience, the zenoh router is pre-build and made available in a Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/zenoh
Thus, run it just doing:
docker pull eclipse/zenoh:latest
docker run --init -p 7447:7447/tcp -p 7447:7447/udp -p 8000:8000/tcp eclipse/zenoh:latest
The ports used by zenoh are the following:

7447/tcp : the zenoh protocol via TCP
7447/udp : the zenoh scouting protocol using UDP multicast (for clients to automatically discover the router)
8000/tcp : the zenoh REST API
All the examples are compiled into the target/release/examples directory. They can all work in peer-to-peer, or interconnected via the zenoh router (target/release/zenohd).
Then, you can test it using the zenoh API in your favorite language:
Rust using the zenoh crate and the examples in this repo
Python using zenoh-python
Or with the REST API:
Examples of usage with the REST API
The complete Eclipse zenoh's key/value space is accessible through the REST API, using regular HTTP GET, PUT and DELETE methods. In those examples, we use the curl command line tool.
Managing the admin space
Get info of the local zenoh router:
curl http://localhost:8000/@/router/local
Get the backends of the local router (only memory by default):
curl 'http://localhost:8000/@/router/local/**/backend/*'
Get the storages of the local router (none by default):

Eclipse zenoh Python API
Eclipse zenoh is an extremely efficient and fault-tolerant Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol
Eclipse zenoh | projects.eclipse.org
GitHub - eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-dds: A zenoh plug-in that allows to transparently route DDS data. This plugin can be used by DDS applications, such as ROS2 robotic applications and others, to leverage the zenoh for geographical routing or for better scaling discovery.
To build the zenoh-c client API you need to ensure that rust is available on your platform.
-- Ubuntu --
$ sudo apt-get install rustc
-- MacOS --
$ brew install rust
The zenoh-c client API needs the nightly version of the rustc rust compiler.
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
$ rustup default nightly
The zenoh-c client API also needs cbindgen to be installed on your platform.
$ cargo install cbindgen
Once the above dependencies are satisfied, just do the following:
$ cd /path/to/zenoh-c
$ make
$ make install # on linux use **sudo**
If you want to build with debug symbols set the BUILD_TYPE=Debug environment variable before running make and make install:
$ cd /path/to/zenoh-c

that is able to scale down to extremely constrainded devices and networks.
The Python API is for pure clients, in other terms does not support peer-to-peer communication, can be easily tested against a zenoh router running in a Docker container (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it).
How to install it
The Eclipse zenoh-python library is available on Pypi.org.
Install the latest available version using pip:
pip install eclipse-zenoh
Supported Python versions and platforms
zenoh-python has been tested with Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.
It relies on the zenoh Rust API which require the full std library. See the list Rust supported platforms here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html .
Currently only the following platforms have been tested:
Linux
MacOS X
How to build it
Requirements:
Python >= 3.5
A virtual environement such as venv, miniconda or Conda

homebrew-zenoh
The zenoh public homebrew tap for OS X homebrew formulae
Installing zenoh
brew tap eclipse-zenoh/homebrew-zenoh
Then install the nighlty toolchain running:
rustup toolchain install nightly
maturin. Install it with:
pip install maturin
Steps:
Make sure your shell is running in a Python virtual environment.
Build zenoh-python using maturin
cd zenoh-python
maturin develop --release
Maturin will automatically build the zenoh Rust API, as well as the zenoh-python API and install it in your Python virtual environement.
Running the Examples
The simplest way to run some of the example is to get a Docker image of the zenoh network router (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it) and then to run the examples on your machine.
Then, run the zenoh-python examples following the instructions in examples/zenoh/README.md

This proposal has been approved and the Eclipse zenoh project has been created.
Eclipse zenoh
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse IoT
Background: As a consequence of the widespread adoption of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and the raise of ed applications, the number of network connected devices is steadily increasingly as is (1) their heterogeneity with respect to computing, storage and communication capabilities, (2) the scale at which they produce and consume data and (3) the need for geo-distributed storage and queries. Thus, data exchange protocols face new needs with respect to vertical and horizontal scalability, support for constrained networks and devices with low duty cycle – in other terms devices that are disconnected/sleeping most of the time as well as ability to deal with both data in motion and data at rest. Protocols used today to build these systems, such as MQTT, DDS, CoAP and HTTP were not designed with these needs in mind. As a result, architects and developers are forced into patchwork design in which multiple protocols are stitched together to provide some meaningful end-to-end semantics. Zenoh's authors have co-invented and built some of the communication infrastructures deployed today as part of telecommunication, aerospace and early Industrial Internet applications (notably DDS). It is with this baggage of experience that they came to the realization that a new protocol was needed – a protocol designed ground-up to address the needs of large scale CPS as well as edge systems end-to-end. Eclipse zenoh, is a stack designed to (1) minimize network overhead – the minimal wire overhead of a data message a data message is 4 bytes, (2) support extremely constrained devices – its footprint on Arduino Uno is of 300 bytes, (3) supports devices with low duty-cycle by allowing the negotiation of data exchange modes and schedules, (4) provide a rich set of abstraction for distributing, querying and storing data along the entire system, and (5) provide extremely low latency and high throughput.
Scope: Eclipse zenoh provides a stack that unifies data in motion, data in-use and data at rest. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
Eclipse zenoh will build around the zenoh infrastructure and includes zenoh software routers/brokers as well as the zenoh client APIs.
Description: Eclipse zenoh provides is a stack designed to (1) minimize network overhead, (2) support extremely constrained devices, (3) supports devices with low duty-cycle by allowing the negotiation of data exchange modes and schedules, (4) provide a rich set of abstraction for distributing, querying and storing data along the entire system, and (5) provide extremely low latency and high throughput.
Why Here?: Zenoh was deisgned with Edge and Fog Computing in mind thus the Eclipse IoT seems to be the right home for it. Beside, Eclipse fog05 relies entirely on zenoh, thus it would make more sense to have the entire fog05 stack to be powered by Eclipse IoT technologies.
Licenses: Apache License, Version 2.0Eclipse Public License 2.0Legal Issues: We own the entirety of the developed IP. Thus to the best of our knowledge there are not potential legal issues.
Project Scheduling: We are ready to go with incubation as soon as the project is accepted. As you can see at http://pkgs.adlink-labs.tech we already have releases for main streams platforms and our github repositors have been made public (see references below).
Thus we are ready now.
Future Work: We plan to work on:
- More client API, next two will be Rust and JavaScript
- Next generation Router rewrite in Rust

Thus, data exchange protocols face new needs with respect to vertical and horizontal scalability, support for constrained networks and devices with low duty cycle – in other terms devices that are disconnected/sleeping most of the time as well as ability to deal with both data in motion and data at rest. Protocols used today to build these systems, such as MQTT, DDS, CoAP and HTTP were not designed with these needs in mind. As a result, architects and developers are forced into patchwork design in which multiple protocols are stitched together to provide some meaningful end-to-end semantics. Zenoh's authors have co-invented and built some of the communication infrastructures deployed today as part of telecommunication, aerospace and early Industrial Internet applications (notably DDS). It is with this baggage of experience that they came to the realization that a new protocol was needed – a protocol designed ground-up to address the needs of large scale CPS as well as edge systems end-to-end. Eclipse zenoh, is a stack designed to (1) minimize network overhead – the minimal wire overhead of a data message a data message is 4 bytes, (2) support extremely constrained devices – its footprint on Arduino Uno is of 300 bytes, (3) supports devices with low duty-cycle by allowing the negotiation of data exchange modes and schedules, (4) provide a rich set of abstraction for distributing, querying and storing data along the entire system, and (5) provide extremely low latency and high throughput.
Scope: Eclipse zenoh provides a stack that unifies data in motion, data in-use and data at rest. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
Eclipse zenoh will build around the zenoh infrastructure and includes zenoh software routers/brokers as well as the zenoh client APIs.
Description: Eclipse zenoh provides is a stack designed to (1) minimize network overhead, (2) support extremely constrained devices, (3) supports devices with low duty-cycle by allowing the negotiation of data exchange modes and schedules, (4) provide a rich set of abstraction for distributing, querying and storing data along the entire system, and (5) provide extremely low latency and high throughput.
Why Here?: Zenoh was deisgned with Edge and Fog Computing in mind thus the Eclipse IoT seems to be the right home for it. Beside, Eclipse fog05 relies entirely on zenoh, thus it would make more sense to have the entire fog05 stack to be powered by Eclipse IoT technologies.
Initial Contribution: Our intial contribution will include:
Zenoh Router. The zenoh software router implements a routing infrastructure that allows to run zenoh applications at Internet Scale. Zenoh routers can be connected over arbitrariy graphs and maintain the routing topology through a series of self-stabilising decentralised algorithms.
Zenoh Client API. We will contribute client API for C, Java, Python, Go.
Zenoh Management. Zenoh routers exposed a REST based management API will will be made avaiable.
Zenoh Storage Plug-ins. We will contribute storage plugins for main-memory, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, InfluxDB
Zenoh Protocol Specification and Documentation. We will contribute the zenoh protocol specification along with the API documentation and user guides.
Legal Issues: We own the entirety of the developed IP. Thus to the best of our knowledge there are not potential legal issues.

Eclipse zenoh C Client API
Eclipse zenoh is an extremely efficient and fault-tolerant Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol
that is able to scale down to extremely constrainded devices and networks.
The C API is for pure clients, in other terms does not support peer-to-peer communication, can be easily tested against a zenoh router running in a Docker container (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it).
How to install it
The Eclipse zenoh-c library is available as Debian or RPM packages in the Eclipse zenoh download area.
Those packages are built using manylinux2010 x86-32 and x86-64 to be compatible with most of the Linux platforms.
There are 2 kind of packages:
libzenohc: only contains the library file (.so)
libzenohc-dev: contains the zenoh-c header files for development. Depends on libzenohc package
For other platforms, you will need to clone and build the sources.
WARNING: Note that zenoh-c has not been ported on Windows yet!
How to build it
To build the zenoh-c client API you need to ensure that cmake is available on your platform -- if not please install it.
Once the cmake dependency is satisfied, just do the following for CMake version 3 and higher:

-- CMake version 3 and higher --
$ cd /path/to/zenoh-c
$ make
$ make install # on linux use **sudo**
If you want to build with debug symbols set the BUILD_TYPE=Debugenvironment variable before to run make:
$ cd /path/to/zenoh-c
$ BUILD_TYPE=Debug make
$ make install # on linux use **sudo**
For those that still have CMake version 2.8, do the following commands:
$ cd /path/to/zenoh-c
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../cmake-2.8
$ make
$ make install # on linux use **sudo**
Running the Examples
The simplest way to run some of the example is to get a Docker image of the zenoh network router (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it) and then to run the examples on your machine.

Eclipse zenoh Go API
Eclipse zenoh is an extremely efficient and fault-tolerant Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol
that is able to scale down to extremely constrainded devices and networks.
⚠️ zenoh has been subjet to a complete rewrite with major protocol updates between versions 0.4.2 and 0.5.0. The Go API does not yet integrate those changes and is only compatible with version 0.4.2 of the zenoh daemon and the underlying zenoh-c stack.
The Go API is for pure clients, in other terms does not support peer-to-peer communication, can be easily tested against a zenoh router running in a Docker container (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it).
How to install it
The zenoh-go library relies on the zenoh-c library. Please install it, either installing the libzenohc-dev package, either building zenoh-c by yourself

$ docker run --init -p 7447:7447/tcp -p 7447:7447/udp -p 8000:8000/tcp adlinktech/eclipse-zenoh:latest
To see the zenoh manual page, simply do:
$ docker run --init -p 7447:7447/tcp -p 7447:7447/udp -p 8000:8000/tcp adlinktech/eclipse-zenoh:latest --help
Basic Pub/Sub Example
Assuming that (1) you are running the zenoh network service, and (2) you are under the build directory, do:
$ ./z_sub
And on another shell, do:
$ ./z_pub
Storage and Query Example
Assuming you are running the zenoh network service, do:
$ ./z_storage
And on another shell, do:
$ ./z_pub
After a few publications just terminate the publisher, and then try to query the storage:
$ ./z_query

Supported Go version: 1.14.0 minimum.
Install the zenoh-go library via the usual go getcommand:
$ go get github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-go
Running the Examples
The simplest way to run some of the example is to get a Docker image of the zenoh network router (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it) and then to run the examples on your machine.
Then, run the zenoh-go examples following the instructions in examples/zenoh/README.md

Zenoh plugin for DDS
Background
README.md
Eclipse zenoh Java Client API
The Java API for Eclipse zenoh, based on the zenoh-c API via JNI.
⚠️ zenoh has been subjet to a complete rewrite with major protocol updates between versions 0.4.2 and 0.5.0. The Java API does not yet integrate those changes and is only compatible with version 0.4.2 of the zenoh daemon and the underlying zenoh-c stack.
Installation
zenoh-java is available on Maven Central.
Just add the dependency in your POM:
<dependency>
<groupId>org.eclipse.zenoh</groupId>
<artifactId>zenoh</artifactId>
<version>0.4.2-M1</version>
</dependency>
Building
Requirements:
Java >= 8
Apache Maven >= 3.6.0

About
The Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a standard for data-centric publish subscribe. Whilst DDS has been around for quite some time and has a long history of deployments in various industries, it has recently gained quite a bit of attentions thanks to its adoption by the Robotic Operating System (ROS2) -- where it is used for communication between ROS2 nodes.
Robot Swarms and Edge Robotics
As mentioned above, ROS2 has adopted DDS as the mechanism to exchange data between nodes within and potentially across a robot. That said, due to some of the very core assumptions at the foundations of the DDS wire-protocol, beside the fact that it leverage UDP/IP multicast for communication, it is not so straightforward to scale DDS communication over a WAN or across multiple LANs. Zenoh, on the other hand was designed since its inception to operate at Internet Scale.
Thus, the main motivations to have a DDS connector for zenoh are:
Facilitate the interconnection of robot swarms.
Support use cases of edge robotics.
Give the possibility to use zenoh's geo-distributed storage and query system to better manage robot's data.
Architecture
zenoh routers provide a plug-in mechanism that allow for extensions to be loaded and activated by its management API. Thus the most natural way to implement a DDS connector for zenoh is to do that as a zenoh router plugin.
This plugin, will essentially:
Spoof DDS discovery data and transparently expose DDS writers/readers as zenoh publisher/subscribers
Route the data produced by discovered DDS writers to data to matching entities.
Beside the zenoh router plugin we also support a stand-alone bridge called dzd that can be used to transparently bridge DDS data on zenoh and viceversa.
Mapping DDS to zenoh
The mapping between DDS and zenoh is rather straightforward. Given a DDS Reader/Writer for topic A in a given partition P with a set of QoS Q, then the equivalent zenoh resource will be named as P/A/*. On the other hand actual writes will be on the resource P/A/sample-key-hash as this allows for zenoh subscriber to easily subscribe to just a specific Topic instance, a set of them or of all of them.
Trying it Out
CMake
make, gcc (for zenoh-c compilation)
Optional for cross-compilation:
Docker
To build for your current platform:
mvn clean install
If zenoh-c is found in the same directory than zenoh-java, the build will copy its sources and compile it.
Otherwise, the build will clone the zenoh-c repository and compile it.
Note that this Maven build offers profiles in addition of the default one:
mvn -Pdebug clean install
compiles zenoh-c with debug logs active
mvn -Prelease clean install
compiles zenoh-c in release mode (without logs)
cross-compiles zenoh-c on all supported platforms (incl. MacOS if this is your current host) using dockross.
generates the Javadoc
generate a ZIP file for release in assembly/target

In order to get running with the DDS plugin for zenoh you need first to install the following dependencies:
CMake
Your favourite C/C++ Compiler
Rust
Once these dependencies are in place, simply do:
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-dds.git
$ cd zenoh-plugin-dds
$ ./config.sh
$ cargo build --release --all-targets
Assuming you want to try this with ROS2, then install it by following the instructions available here.
Once you've installed ROS2, you easily let ROS applications communicate acros the internet. Notice that in order
to really make this work you need to have ROS applications run on different networks. There are different ways of achieving this,
you can use containers, VMs, or hosts on different networks.
In any case assuming you have two networks, let's say N1 and N2, you will need to run one instance of dzd per network.
The dzd daemon will operate like a transparent router discovering DDS traffic and forwarding it on zenoh w/o you having to
configure anything.
You are also welcome to use the freely available zenoh internet infrastructure to route across the internet, in this case

just start one instance of dzd per network by running the following command:
$ cargo run -- --scope /demo/dds -e tcp/172.105.86.91:7447
The on one of the networks, say N1, start a ROS2 listener by using the following command:
$ ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
While on N2 starts a ROS2 talker by using the following command:
$ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
You will see a stream of ROS2 Hello World messages streamed across the internet!
Good Hacking!
