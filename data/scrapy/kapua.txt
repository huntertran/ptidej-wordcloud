Eclipse Kapua‚Ñ¢
Eclipse Kapua‚Ñ¢
is a modular platform providing the services required to manage IoT gateways and smart edge devices. Kapua provides a core integration framework and an initial set of core IoT services including a device registry, device management services, messaging services, data management, and application enablement.
Quick Start Guide
Running an Eclipse Kapua‚Ñ¢ demo instance on your local machine is a simple task.
Eclipse Kapua‚Ñ¢ runs as distributed application that exposes three basic services:
The Messaging Service
The RESTful API
The Web Administration Console
Two more backend services are required that implement the data tier:
The Event Bus Service
The SQL database
The NoSQL datastore
Eclipse Kapua‚Ñ¢ can be deployed in a variety of modes. A practical way for running a local demo is through Docker containers.
Requirements
Before starting, check that your environment has the following prerequisites:

RESTful APIs
The documentation of RESTful API is available at
http://localhost:8081/doc/
while the mount points are available at
http://localhost:8081/v1/
.
The documentation is available through Swagger UI which greatly helps testing and exploring the exposed services.
In order to get access a REST resource through an API, an authentication token is needed. Fortunately the token can be easily obtained by executing the authentication API. There are several ways to invoke the API, an easy one is by using the Swagger UI:
Open the URL

Swagger will automatically add the authentication token to each subsequent request done using the Swagger UI. You're ready to try executing the documented APIs.

In order for a client to establish a Mqtt connection with the broker, a client must provide a valid identity. The

Note
: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be
localhost
but the IP address of your docker instance.
Simulation
Kapua comes with a framework that you can use to simulate Kura gateways. It can be used to test your Kapua deployments easily. See
Simulator documentation
for more info.
More deployment info
Installing and running a demo using Docker is easy, but it's not the only way. There are other scenarios that the users may be interested in. We provide advanced setup scenarios in the following guides:
Running with Docker
Running with OpenShift
Running with Minishift
They will provide more advanced deployment scenarios.

Description of the solution adopted
Changing the query we do when looking for a specific AccessToken, filtering out already expired and invalidated tokens, will allow the DBMS to use the newly created index to perform the search, cutting down the search time.

I changed the gwt version cause I was not able to find an older version of my jdk 1.8.0_251
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
I think you can download older versions from the Oracle web site

Ok, now with firefox 26, gwt plugin and the env variable i'm able to login.

hello there!
sorry

, Gitter app crashed and didn't notice

@darrellwallace
Hey
@lorthirk
, no worries! I realized right after I posted in my end of week productivity rush that I was probably a little late to the party :)
So, I will be managing a medium deployment of Raspberry Pi (currently 200 and up to 500 devices), none of which will be local. I am most concerned with stability and security, I want to make sure that I'm not doing anything silly on those regards when I get this going.

The bulk of my data will be directed to another service, so I will be using Kapua primarily as an inventory/managment solution
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
ok
well... apart for setting up secure communications with all the endpoints (console, rest api ,broker)
darrellwallace
@darrellwallace
right right... I definitely intend to change default password for kapua-sys in the console and also the kapua/kapua for the database
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
ok. beware that the broker needs to know the kapua-sys password to establish an mqtt connection
darrellwallace
@darrellwallace
if I build from newest release using maven, do I need to worry about passing the environment variable with the new kapu-sys pw?
lol, I was just typing that when you responded

hey, there's feeling :)
darrellwallace
@darrellwallace
cool... so, I think I'll also move to a standalone database instead of the containerized H2 so that my db guys don't freak out, is there anything that you can think of that I need to be aware with that move?
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
uhm... nothing specific. maybe a MariaDB instance would be more robust, I guess?
darrellwallace
@darrellwallace
right on, I think that's what my lead pm was thinking too... Thank you, Claudio, for your time, hopefully we will not need much help along the way!

Can we use a LWM2M client connect to Kura, then show LWM2M client in Kapua device list?
GXT 2.2.5 builds upon GWT 2.4
I really wouldn't spend so much time
RiccardoFelicetti
@RiccardoFelicetti
ok
I read online that I need the jre 1.7 with the gwt 2.4.0
is it right?
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
no, 1.8 is fine
but I remember some sort if issues with certain versions... I run the debug with 1.8.0_45
and... usually it works :D
RiccardoFelicetti
@RiccardoFelicetti
I read something about problem after 1.8.0_90

Kapua does not support LWM2M. I don't know if Kura can somehow mediate.
Jieke
@jiekechoo
It means Kapua just supports MQTT broker, so I want to use Kura transfer LWM2M connections to MQTT,
