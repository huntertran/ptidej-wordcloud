Eclipse Kapua™
Eclipse Kapua™ is a modular platform providing the services required to manage IoT gateways and smart edge devices. Kapua provides a core integration framework and an initial set of core IoT services including a device registry, device management services, messaging services, data management, and application enablement.
Quick Start Guide
Running an Eclipse Kapua™ demo instance on your local machine is a simple task.
Eclipse Kapua™ runs as distributed application that exposes three basic services:
The Messaging Service
The RESTful API
The Web Administration Console
Two more backend services are required that implement the data tier:
The Event Bus Service
The SQL database
The NoSQL datastore
Eclipse Kapua™ can be deployed in a variety of modes. A practical way for running a local demo is through Docker containers.
Requirements
Before starting, check that your environment has the following prerequisites:
64 bit architecture
Java VM Version 8
Docker Version 1.2+
Internet Access (needed to download the artifacts)
Demo Setup

The team maintains some docker images in a Docker Hub repository at Kapua Repository. Check the repo to view the list of available images, if you haven't found one fitting your needs you may create your own. Please refer to the paragraph More deployment info to find more about creating your own images and/or alternative demo deployment scenarios.
Note: the Docker Hub repository mentioned above is not the official project repository from Eclipse Foundation.
Suppose the target is the current snapshot 1.4.0-SNAPSHOT.
Clone Eclipse Kapua™ into a local directory
Open an OS shell and move to Kapua project root directory
Start Docker runtime
Start Kapua:
On Linux/MacOS:
./deployment/docker/unix/docker-deploy.sh
On Windows (PowerShell):
./deployment/docker/win/docker-deploy.ps1
The command starts all the Kapua containers using Docker Compose.
By default, the latest version of images will be used. If you want to run some other version of Kapua, set the IMAGE_VERSION environment variable, for example:
export IMAGE_VERSION=0.2.0
You can check if the containers are running by typing the following command:
docker ps -as
Docker will list the containers currently running.
To stop Kapua, run
On Linux/MacOS:
./deployment/docker/unix/docker-undeploy.sh
On Windows (PowerShell):
./deployment/docker/win/docker-undeploy.ps1
Access
Once the containers are running, the Kapua services can be accessed. Eclipse Kapua™ is a multi tenant

system. The demo installation comes with one default tenant, called kapua-sys, which is also the root tenant.
In Eclipse Kapua™ a tenant is commonly referred to as an account.
The console
The administration console is available at http://localhost:8080/.
Copy paste the URL above to a Web browser, as the login screen appears, type the following credentials:
Username: kapua-sys
Password: kapua-password
Press Login button and start working with the console.
Note: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be localhost but
the IP address of your docker instance.
RESTful APIs
The documentation of RESTful API is available at http://localhost:8081/doc/ while the mount points are available at http://localhost:8081/v1/.
The documentation is available through Swagger UI which greatly helps testing and exploring the exposed services.
In order to get access a REST resource through an API, an authentication token is needed. Fortunately the token can be easily obtained by executing the authentication API. There are several ways to invoke the API, an easy one is by using the Swagger UI:
Open the URL http://localhost:8081/doc/
Select item Authentication
Select item /authentication/user
Using the test feature run 'POST /authentication/user' by specifying the following body:
{
"password" : [ "kapua-password" ],
"username": "kapua-sys"
}
Note: as an alternative to the previous, if curl is available on your machine, execute the following from the shell:

This change improves REST API usage in case of iterating over messages.

curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/v1/authentication/user' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{
"password": [
"kapua-password"
],
"username": "kapua-sys"
}'
The system will return a JSON object.
Copy the value of the field tokenId
Paste the value in the box labelled api_key at the top of the web page
Swagger will automatically add the authentication token to each subsequent request done using the Swagger UI. You're ready to try executing the documented APIs.
Note: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be localhost but
the IP address of your docker instance.
The Broker
The broker container exposes an Mqtt end point at tcp://localhost:1883/.
The broker can be accessed through either Eclipse Kura™ or a plain Mqtt client like, for example, Eclipse Paho™.
In order for a client to establish a Mqtt connection with the broker, a client must provide a valid identity. The kapua-sys account provides the user named kapua-broker which has been pre-seeded and profiled for the purpose.
The credentials for the user kapua-broker are the following:
Username: kapua-broker
Password: kapua-password
Note: do not use the user kapua-sys to establish Mqtt connections.
Note: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be localhost but
the IP address of your docker instance.
Simulation
Kapua comes with a framework that you can use to simulate Kura gateways. It can be used to test your Kapua deployments easily. See Simulator documentation for more info.

Thanks for the submission @xshiart!
yes, it's a good thing to help investigating the issue
Pedro
@pintify
Indeed, I'll let you know if it happens again
Thanks for everything!
Pedro
@pintify
Well... The issue is back again
All of the containers are on a normal consumption of RAM and CPU
From CAdvisor monitor, that would be broker container
riccardomodanese
@riccardomodanese
can you investigate if there are network connections established (from inside the broker container) and if you can connect from outside (telnet or similar) to the broker?
Pedro
@pintify
Some of the devices are still connected. If I reset any of those connections it is not restablished
I can also telnet both 1883 and 8883 ports

I would kindly ask for a few changes, and also it would be great if you could update the OpenAPI specification under rest-api/resources/src/main/resources/openapi.
I'll gladly merge this as soon as it's ready!

i suggest you to investigate the broker jvm taking a thread dump and to enable the gc log

@pintify
Indeed, I'll let you know if it happens again
Thanks for everything!
Pedro
@pintify
Well... The issue is back again
All of the containers are on a normal consumption of RAM and CPU
From CAdvisor monitor, that would be broker container
riccardomodanese
@riccardomodanese
can you investigate if there are network connections established (from inside the broker container) and if you can connect from outside (telnet or similar) to the broker?
Pedro
@pintify
Some of the devices are still connected. If I reset any of those connections it is not restablished
I can also telnet both 1883 and 8883 ports
riccardomodanese
@riccardomodanese
yes but how many network connections are established in the broker container (I mean using netstat inside the broker container)

We've been also discussing the issue and the broker has increasingly started to receive more connections during the last two weeks as some devices are starting to publish to it, is there an overall limit of incoming messages or devices?
Pedro
@pintify
i suggest you to investigate the broker jvm taking a thread dump and to enable the gc log
We have no easy way to make such analysis because it is a production environment, but I will request it

@riccardomodanese
obviously there is an overall limit and depends also on your machines performances
if you are suspecting you reached the performance limit I suggest you to try to decrease the load to find a "stable" point
Pedro
@pintify
I'll try that, we've experienced this issue a third time in three days...
I think I will create an issue, is it alright?
Pedro
@pintify
In a different scope, the databases are replaceable? We have a SQL database and an ElasticSearch instances with indisputable good performance. By the docker-compose, I guess the elasticsearch has no particular configuration moreover access, but I'm not sure the H2 database is replaceable by any kind of SQL or even if the image provided has any specific modification
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
yes, you can replace the DB with any JDBC compliant database
for MySQL/MariaDB the support should be already implemented, just change a few system properties
for others databases, probably a few lines should be written
I think I will create an issue, is it alright?
sure, it's good to have that as an issue, but honestly it looks something more related to ActiveMQ than to Kapua itself. I'm not that confident we can tackle this.
Pedro
@pintify
That's great news, I'll look forward that change as soon as possible, thanks
for MySQL/MariaDB the support should be already implemented, just change a few system properties

Made maven test run more intuitive, by supporting basic clean install as well as separate profile for
full integration tests.
Description of the solution adopted
Fixed maven build with "mvn clean install" to run tests with embedded servers.
Also added profile I9nTests that runs integration tests, but before running
those tests, docker containers are started with fabric8 plugin. Those
tests can now be run with command "mvn test -PI9nTests". This command shall be
executed in qa module, as integration tests are only available there.
Read RunTest.md for further details of running those tests.

Is there any documentation on the changes required?
Let me check. are you interested in a specific DB?
Pedro
@pintify
MySQL would be great
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
IIRC the only change would be commons.db.jdbcConnectionUrlResolver=MariaDB
and of course you have to include the MySQL JDBC connector
Pedro
@pintify
IIRC the only change would be commons.db.jdbcConnectionUrlResolver=MariaDB
MariaDB or Mysql?
Ok, that seems easy to do, I'll explore that option

Hi Again ... I want to send a MQTT message on the control topic $EDC/../..MQTT/APPS from Kura to KapuaCan anyone guide me how should i publish the mqtt message on this topic in a Kura package?
YatinParashar
@YatinParashar
Hello Everyone ... I have been able to publish a mqtt message on a new control topic from Kura to Kapua using CloudClient class (deprecated though)... Thanks for your support :) I have added two metrics in the Payload which i have recieved on the Kapua ... Now i want to change the value of one metric and then publish it back to Kura ... Does anyone has any suggestion what would be the ideal approach to publish it from Kapua to Kura (on CONTROL topic $EDC/.../../../..)
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
You can use REST APIs for that
I don't think there's a way through the Console right now
YatinParashar
@YatinParashar
ohh ... is it feasible to use mqtt paho library in kapua to publish on the control topic (and converting the payload to KuraPayload)?

@Coduz can you please review.
@LeoNerdoG can you also try it on your environment, I tried it on two and it works for me, but it would be nice if it worked for everyone.

Caused by: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out

at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead(SocketInputStream.java:116)
at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:171)
at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:141)I've noticed that client side has now a different error, as shown above
We've been also discussing the issue and the broker has increasingly started to receive more connections during the last two weeks as some devices are starting to publish to it, is there an overall limit of incoming messages or devices?
Pedro
@pintify
i suggest you to investigate the broker jvm taking a thread dump and to enable the gc log
We have no easy way to make such analysis because it is a production environment, but I will request it
riccardomodanese
@riccardomodanese
obviously there is an overall limit and depends also on your machines performances
if you are suspecting you reached the performance limit I suggest you to try to decrease the load to find a "stable" point
Pedro
@pintify
I'll try that, we've experienced this issue a third time in three days...
I think I will create an issue, is it alright?

@pintify
In a different scope, the databases are replaceable? We have a SQL database and an ElasticSearch instances with indisputable good performance. By the docker-compose, I guess the elasticsearch has no particular configuration moreover access, but I'm not sure the H2 database is replaceable by any kind of SQL or even if the image provided has any specific modification
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
yes, you can replace the DB with any JDBC compliant database
for MySQL/MariaDB the support should be already implemented, just change a few system properties
for others databases, probably a few lines should be written
I think I will create an issue, is it alright?
sure, it's good to have that as an issue, but honestly it looks something more related to ActiveMQ than to Kapua itself. I'm not that confident we can tackle this.
Pedro
@pintify
That's great news, I'll look forward that change as soon as possible, thanks
for MySQL/MariaDB the support should be already implemented, just change a few system properties
Is there any documentation on the changes required?

IIRC the only change would be commons.db.jdbcConnectionUrlResolver=MariaDB
and of course you have to include the MySQL JDBC connector

IIRC the only change would be commons.db.jdbcConnectionUrlResolver=MariaDB
MariaDB or Mysql?
Ok, that seems easy to do, I'll explore that option
Thanks!

@lorthirk
MariaDB, it should work for MySQL as well

Hi Again ... I want to send a MQTT message on the control topic $EDC/../..MQTT/APPS from Kura to KapuaCan anyone guide me how should i publish the mqtt message on this topic in a Kura package?

Outdated
Start dockerized Kapua
With fabric8 plugin usage tests can now be run without explicitly running dockerized environment.
Docker containers providing Kapua infrastructure are started with maven itself.
But tu run these integration tests, you have to switch to qa folder and run following command

This PR removes the QRCodeServlet and introduces QR code image generation directly inside the MfaOptionImpl class. In this way the image is already returned with the MfaOption object, without the need for performing the call to the servlet and passing sensitive data.

Hello Everyone ... I have been able to publish a mqtt message on a new control topic from Kura to Kapua using CloudClient class (deprecated though)... Thanks for your support :) I have added two metrics in the Payload which i have recieved on the Kapua ... Now i want to change the value of one metric and then publish it back to Kura ... Does anyone has any suggestion what would be the ideal approach to publish it from Kapua to Kura (on CONTROL topic $EDC/.../../../..)
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
You can use REST APIs for that
I don't think there's a way through the Console right now
YatinParashar
@YatinParashar
ohh ... is it feasible to use mqtt paho library in kapua to publish on the control topic (and converting the payload to KuraPayload)?
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
oh, well, yes
but I don't know specifically about the control topic
there may be some restrictions due to the ACLs

You are missing "P" in "-I9nTests" - the command should be "mvn docker:stop -PI9nTests"

Description of the solution adopted
The QR code image is stored temporarily in the MfaOption object in base64 format. Note also that, even if the image is part of the MfaOption, it is not stored in the DB. Indeed the image is only needed once when the MFA is first enabled for the user. Then, it is not required anymore.

Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Currently kapua-sys user is enabled by configuration and disabling it is not allowed by business logic.
It would be nice to allow enabling/disabling such user, in order to support the following use case:
As a platform administrator I want to disable the kapua-sys user after the initial platform configuration has been carried and nominative admin users created so that further administration activities are carried out by the new users.
Describe the solution you'd like

Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The SSO generic-provider in Kapua requires passing various properties in order to connect properly to the OpenID Provider. However, we could simply read the well-known configuration document provided by the OpenID Provider and configure the generic-provider consequently.
The well-known configuration document is part of the OpenID specification, see here for more information.

Describe the solution you'd like
The configuration step could first try configuring by using the well-known document. Then, if this step fails, it could use the manual configuration.
Describe alternatives you've considered
An alternative could be implementing an automatic-provider dedicated to the automatic configuration through the well-known document and maintain the generic-provider as it is currently implemented for manual configuration.
Additional context
Implementing this improvement does not mean to get rid of dedicated providers, since there can be OpenID Providers that are not fully compliant with the OpenID specification and thus require a dedicated provider to be configured on Kapua.

Added a property to disable the OpenID Connect logout.
Related Issue
N/A
Description of the solution adopted
The OpenID Connect logout can be disabled by setting the console.sso.openid.logout.enabled property to false. This property is always true by default.
If the OpenID logout is disabled, the user is allowed to login again into the Kapua Console without the need to provide any credentials.
Screenshots
N/A
Any side note on the changes made
This feature is implemented directly inside the getSsoLogoutUri method of the GwtSettingsServiceImpl class. If the property is false, an empty string (URL) will be returned to the console on the browser side, and the call to the logout endpoint won't be performed. This simple approach has been preferred to the use of a dedicated callback, in order to avoid having too many nested callbacks.

This PR adds some logging messages to SSO methods, in particular when performing HTTP requests and when retrieving URLs/URIs.

Any side note on the changes made
Exception handling has also been improved when required.
Please note that since the Kapua default logging level is info, while this PR uses debug Log4j methods, none of the info provided with this PR will be actually plotted in the log. However please note that PR #3086 introduces adjustable logging level, allowing one to set default as logging level. So, even if this PR doesn't require other PRs to be merged, it will only work when PR #3086 will be merged.

I have to list and paginate the users but I don't know how many are the total elements to display.
When I call the API to retrieve the list of users, I would like to specify the askTotalCount paremeter in order to get the totalCount of elements to paginate the results.

Two changes about REST APIs in this PR:
WADL generation when issuing an OPTIONS HTTP request has been disabled
CORSResponseFilter, that was moved in Shiro with #2855, has been refactored to be a standalone Filter, since it's more logical. It will still be executed before the Shiro filter anyway, so the logic of that change is preserved.

Add MQTT connector for internal use (Console, RestAPI).
This pr enhance the security since now the Kapua components don't need to know a real user to connect to the broker and is a step forward toward the adoption of AMQP as inter-components communication standard.
The new connector will use the 1893 port as defalt.
Anyway, as for the other connectors, is customizable.

This PR introduces matchTerm query parameter in REST API simple queries.
Related Issue
No related issue
Description of the solution adopted
A new matchTerm query parameter is now available in Devices REST API. This query parameter will convert the value in a MatchPredicate. A MatchPredicate is a new kind of predicate that will match all the entities where at least one of the fields, that are hardcoded in every MatchPredicate implementation, starts with the provided value, case insensitive.
For DeviceMatchPredicate the following fields will be evaluated:
CLIENT_ID
DISPLAY_NAME
SERIAL_NUMBER
MODEL_ID
MODEL_NAME
BIOS_VERSION
FIRMWARE_VERSION

Hi @sonja-ct ,
I've made some comments. I've commented only first occurrence of many things, but I would like to have that fixed on all places (i.e: all places where:
EventStoreRecordImpl eventStoreRecordImpl = new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId);
assertNotNull("Null not expected.", eventStoreRecordImpl);
is done.

This test is always true.
Is not possible to have a null object after a new, and if new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId) goes on exception, this assertNotNull is not executed.

@sonja-ct I suggest that you check here if the created object is of right instance (for example we are expecting "X" instance and if in future this changes so the method returns instance of an object "Y" we will have a test that will check this.

assertNotNull is generally used only when you ahve two outcomes, Null and some not null value. It can also be a part of some assertion list (several assertions that check various things). I agree with @Coduz on this one.

But a result of a new is always a notNull object, unless Exception, which is not covered anyway by this assertNotNull. This is the same thing as writing assertTrue(true).
If new returns a null, well Java must be a bit stoned or something 😂

I wouldn't also mind to check for the right instance type.
Doing:
EventStoreRecordImpl eventStoreRecordImpl = new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId);
assertTrue(eventStoreRecordImpl instence of EventStoreRecordImpl)
is useless for the same reasons.

Also this:
EventStoreRecordImpl eventStoreRecordImpl = new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId);
assertTrue(eventStoreRecordImpl instence of EventStoreRecord)
is useless. In both cases, if that isn't true ClassCastException would be thrown when assigning the new result to the local variable.

String contextId = "ContextId";
for (KapuaId scopeId : scopeIdList) {
EventStoreRecordImpl eventStoreRecordImpl1 = new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId);
assertNull("Null expected.", eventStoreRecordImpl1.getContextId());
eventStoreRecordImpl1.setContextId(contextId);
assertEquals("Expected and actual values should be the same.", contextId, eventStoreRecordImpl1.getContextId());

I think that testing for different values of scopeId is not meaningful.
We want to test only once test and get.

hey @henry-lp,
when trying to build your branch, I discovered that you have some checkstyle violations:
Output is:
[ERROR] rest-api/resources/src/test/java/org/eclipse/kapua/app/api/resources/v1/resources/TagsTests.java:[11,27] (whitespace) MethodParamPad: '(' is preceded with whitespace.
[ERROR] rest-api/resources/src/test/java/org/eclipse/kapua/app/api/resources/v1/resources/TagsTests.java:[14] (whitespace) EmptyLineSeparator: There is more than 1 empty line one after another.
can you please check? Just run mvn clean install -DskipTests on your branch.
👍

@Coduz here we are checking if the contextId is null and in the "eventStoreRecordImplTest3" we check if the expected and actual values are the same, so these are two different cases. If I am seeing right.

@LeoNerdoG ,
Thanks for pointing out :) . For some reasons I only see this checkstyle error at my local branch after pulling the newest changes
After fixing it I ran mvn clean install -DskipTests and it seems to be green at least.

@Coduz we should always mock as much methods as possible to isolate unit test as much as possible.
We don't want actual implementation of other methods to imterfere with our Unit tests.

@sonja-ct I suggest that you check here if the created object is of right instance (for example we are expecting "X" instance and if in future this changes so the method returns instance of an object "Y" we will have a test that will check this.
assertNotNull is generally used only when you ahve two outcomes, Null and some not null value. It can also be a part of some assertion list (several assertions that check various things). I agree with @Coduz on this one.

Thanks a lot for the offer. Perhaps somewhere in the future, since I feel like this is only a small change from my part :) .
Anyways, I have squashed them into one commit as you suggested and also, thanks for accepting this patch.

@Coduz here we are checking if the contextId is null and in the "eventStoreRecordImplTest3" we check if the expected and actual values are the same, so these are two different cases. If I am seeing right.

The import for org.eclipse.kapua.service.authorization.permission.Permission inside the REST API JaxbContextResolver is actually pointing to a wrong class, java.security.acl.Permission. This PR fixes this import.

Description of the solution adopted
Recently the old method of sourcing the maven.tar.gz from mirrors and installing it manually had some issues with downloading the file.
