Eclipse Kapua™
Eclipse Kapua™ is a modular platform providing the services required to manage IoT gateways and smart edge devices. Kapua provides a core integration framework and an initial set of core IoT services including a device registry, device management services, messaging services, data management, and application enablement.
Quick Start Guide
Running an Eclipse Kapua™ demo instance on your local machine is a simple task.
Eclipse Kapua™ runs as distributed application that exposes three basic services:
The Messaging Service
The RESTful API
The Web Administration Console
Two more backend services are required that implement the data tier:
The Event Bus Service
The SQL database
The NoSQL datastore
Eclipse Kapua™ can be deployed in a variety of modes. A practical way for running a local demo is through Docker containers.

Requirements
Before starting, check that your environment has the following prerequisites:
64 bit architecture
Java VM Version 8
Docker Version 1.2+
Internet Access (needed to download the artifacts)
Demo Setup
The team maintains some docker images in a Docker Hub repository at Kapua Repository. Check the repo to view the list of available images, if you haven't found one fitting your needs you may create your own. Please refer to the paragraph More deployment info to find more about creating your own images and/or alternative demo deployment scenarios.
Note: the Docker Hub repository mentioned above is not the official project repository from Eclipse Foundation.
Suppose the target is the current snapshot 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT.
Clone Eclipse Kapua™ into a local directory
Open an OS shell and move to Kapua project root directory
Start Docker runtime
Start Kapua:
On Linux/MacOS:
./deployment/docker/unix/docker-deploy.sh
On Windows (PowerShell):
./deployment/docker/win/docker-deploy.ps1

The command starts all the Kapua containers using Docker Compose.
By default, the latest version of images will be used. If you want to run some other version of Kapua, set the IMAGE_VERSION environment variable, for example:
export IMAGE_VERSION=0.2.0
You can check if the containers are running by typing the following command:
docker ps -as
Docker will list the containers currently running.
To stop Kapua, run
On Linux/MacOS:
./deployment/docker/unix/docker-undeploy.sh
On Windows (PowerShell):
./deployment/docker/win/docker-undeploy.ps1
Access
Once the containers are running, the Kapua services can be accessed. Eclipse Kapua™ is a multi tenant
system. The demo installation comes with one default tenant, called kapua-sys, which is also the root tenant.
In Eclipse Kapua™ a tenant is commonly referred to as an account.
The console
The administration console is available at http://localhost:8080/.
Copy paste the URL above to a Web browser, as the login screen appears, type the following credentials:

Labels
Username: kapua-sys
Password: kapua-password
Press Login button and start working with the console.
Note: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be localhost but
the IP address of your docker instance.
RESTful APIs
The documentation of RESTful API is available at http://localhost:8081/doc/ while the mount points are available at http://localhost:8081/v1/.
The documentation is available through Swagger UI which greatly helps testing and exploring the exposed services.
In order to get access a REST resource through an API, an authentication token is needed. Fortunately the token can be easily obtained by executing the authentication API. There are several ways to invoke the API, an easy one is by using the Swagger UI:
Open the URL http://localhost:8081/doc/
Select item Authentication
Select item /authentication/user
Using the test feature run 'POST /authentication/user' by specifying the following body:
{
"password" : [ "kapua-password" ],
"username": "kapua-sys"
}
Note: as an alternative to the previous, if curl is available on your machine, execute the following from the shell:

"password": [
"kapua-password"
],
"username": "kapua-sys"
}'
The system will return a JSON object.
Copy the value of the field tokenId
Paste the value in the box labelled api_key at the top of the web page
Swagger will automatically add the authentication token to each subsequent request done using the Swagger UI. You're ready to try executing the documented APIs.
Note: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be localhost but
the IP address of your docker instance.
The Broker
The broker container exposes an Mqtt end point at tcp://localhost:1883/.
The broker can be accessed through either Eclipse Kura™ or a plain Mqtt client like, for example, Eclipse Paho™.
In order for a client to establish a Mqtt connection with the broker, a client must provide a valid identity. The kapua-sys account provides the user named kapua-broker which has been pre-seeded and profiled for the purpose.
The credentials for the user kapua-broker are the following:
Username: kapua-broker

Simulation
Kapua comes with a framework that you can use to simulate Kura gateways. It can be used to test your Kapua deployments easily. See Simulator documentation for more info.
More deployment info
Installing and running a demo using Docker is easy, but it's not the only way. There are other scenarios that the users may be interested in. We provide advanced setup scenarios in the following guides:
Running with Docker
Running with OpenShift
Running with Minishift
They will provide more advanced deployment scenarios.

How to contribute to Eclipse Kapua
First of all, thanks for considering to contribute to Eclipse Kapua. We really appreciate the time and effort you want to
spend helping to improve things around here. And help we can use :-)
Here is a (non-exclusive, non-prioritized) list of things you might be able to help us with:
bug reports
bug fixes
improvements regarding code quality e.g. improving readability, performance, modularity etc.
documentation (Getting Started guide, Examples, Deployment instructions in cloud environments)
features (both ideas and code are welcome)
In order to get you started as fast as possible we need to go through some organizational issues first, though.
Legal Requirements
Kapua is an Eclipse IoT project and as such is governed by the Eclipse Development process.
This process helps us in creating great open source software within a safe legal framework.
For you as a contributor, the following preliminary steps are required in order for us to be able to accept your contribution:
Sign the Eclipse Foundation Contributor License Agreement.
In order to do so:
Obtain an Eclipse Foundation user ID. Anyone who currently uses Eclipse Bugzilla or Gerrit systems already has one of those.
If you don't already have an account simply register on the Eclipse web site.
Once you have your account, log in to the projects portal, select My Account and then the Contributor License Agreement tab.
Add your GiHub username to your Eclipse Foundation account. Log in to Eclipse and go to Edit my account.
The easiest way to contribute code/patches/whatever is by creating a GitHub pull request (PR). When you do make sure that you Sign-off your commit records using the same email address used for your Eclipse account.
You do this by adding the -s flag when you make the commit(s), e.g.

Package download endpoint has this warning:
However, how could I know the operationId I should look for?
In case it must be searched in /operations endpoint "manually", which id should I use, for the operation object has two different ids:
{
"type": "deviceManagementOperation",
"id": "LwLogSRx13I",
...
"operationId": "SfWNEoZY1FQ",
},
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
nice question. I THINK you should be using operationId
Pedro
@pintify
Great, thanks! And is there a way to achieve the operationId I need without inspecting all the operations?
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
uhm... probably @Coduz is the best person to ask :D

Hello, I just tried to run docker-deploy.sh from the latest version off github. I'm getting an error when trying to pull kapua/kapua-job-engine. I'm running as a docker permissible user. I do not have extensive docker experience, so it could easily be a noob error. Any assistance wold be greatly appreciated. Here's the error sequence: ./docker-deploy.shDeploying Eclipse Kapua...Creating network "compose_default" with the default driverPulling job-engine (kapua/kapua-job-engine:latest)...ERROR: The image for the service you're trying to recreate has been removed. If you continue, volume data could be lost. Consider backing up your data before continuing.

To add to my previous message. I'm running Ubuntu 20.04. Docker is version 20.10.5, build 55c4c88. docker-compose is version 1.29.0, build 07737305. Thanks all for any assistance / direction you can provide me.

Minor update to my last two messages - I removed the kapua-job-engine image from docker-compose.yml configuration file. Demo instance appears to be at least partially available now. Still interested in the impact removing this container (threading / task mgmt I assume?) will have.
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
have you built the images with mvn clean install -Pdocker first?

without the job engine you won't be able to execute any batch jobs on devices

Hi @lorthirk , hope you're doing great. I tried to build and Run kapua on ubuntu 20.04 amd64bit.I started with docker (kapua/deployment/docker/unix/docker-deploy.sh) and It was unsuccessful(Image does not exist. Then I found out to build images in my computer using this (https://www.eclipse.org/kapua/docs/1.4.0/developer-guide/en/building.html) and I got many Erros. what can i do to fix it? ( also i have to mention that I've installed jdk8 (sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk), docker, docker compose, and in all processes I was in root(sudo su).
When I did run (mvn clean install -Pconsole) in root mode. I got some errors:

@rezahili
let me open an issue. It's better
then I could post all errors and steps there
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
uhm... in order to build the images you can skip tests
which JVM are you using?
Reza
@rezahili
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
I used this
openjdk version "1.8.0_292"OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_292-8u292-b10-0ubuntu1~20.04-b10)OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.292-b10, mixed mode)
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
uhm... it's something about the available SHA algorithms
our CI doesn't show anything strange, so it should be something on your side
Reza
@rezahili
How to see what version of SHA algorithms is working on my ubuntu ?
I saw SHA or something like that when I was upgrading ubuntu.
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
uhm... I'm not sure
but why don't you just append -DskipTests to the Maven command?
Reza
@rezahili
lets do it
Reza
@rezahili
It's done
Reza
@rezahili
uhm... I'm not sure
Thank u. I opened an issue and closed it for other people.

HiI installed Kapua and Kura and everything is fine. I used this document (https://github.com/eclipse/kapua/pull/780/files) to connect my Kura device to Kapua through MQTT. I received connection status in kapua(Connections), but I couldn't get my connected device in the Devices part of Kapua, and also I didn't get message from my Kura device.
does anyone know? what is happening? what is the problem?
@lorthirk did you see that before? thank you
Reza
@rezahili
eclipse/kapua#3327 this is the whole story
Laurent Carré
@sterwen
@rezahili in most of the case you experience that problem when the 'Kapua-account' doas not match between Kura and Kapua. Can be a typo. The user/passord are correct so you can connect on the broker and the connection is green , but nothing in the devices because the account is wrong. Also check you Kapua account settings and user role and authorization.

Yes exactly, I fixed it by creating an account again but in a right way.

Hi
Reza
@rezahili
after a lot of hair pulling I succeeded to make a communication between kapua and kura. I can configure my devices and I can see my device on devices tab on console. Now, I'm using mqtt publisher example but it doesn't work. should I use something more than this ?

Fixes #3279, i.e. the mfaSecretKey was returned by the method findMfa of Users class even if it was not needed.
For security reasons is better to not return it.
Description of the solution adopted
In the findMfa use the method setMfaSecretKey of mfaOption object in order to set the mfaSecretKey to null before returning the result.
