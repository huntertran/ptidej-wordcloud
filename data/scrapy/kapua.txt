Eclipse Kapua™
Eclipse Kapua™ is a modular platform providing the services required to manage IoT gateways and smart edge devices. Kapua provides a core integration framework and an initial set of core IoT services including a device registry, device management services, messaging services, data management, and application enablement.
Quick Start Guide
Running an Eclipse Kapua™ demo instance on your local machine is a simple task.
Eclipse Kapua™ runs as distributed application that exposes three basic services:

The RESTful API
The Web Administration Console
Two more backend services are required that implement the data tier:
The Event Bus Service
The SQL database
The NoSQL datastore
Eclipse Kapua™ can be deployed in a variety of modes. A practical way for running a local demo is through Docker containers.
Requirements
Before starting, check that your environment has the following prerequisites:
64 bit architecture
Java VM Version 8
Docker Version 1.2+
Internet Access (needed to download the artifacts)
Demo Setup
The team maintains some docker images in a Docker Hub repository at Kapua Repository. Check the repo to view the list of available images, if you haven't found one fitting your needs you may create your own. Please refer to the paragraph More deployment info to find more about creating your own images and/or alternative demo deployment scenarios.
Note: the Docker Hub repository mentioned above is not the official project repository from Eclipse Foundation.

Suppose the target is the current snapshot 1.4.0-SNAPSHOT.
Clone Eclipse Kapua™ into a local directory
Open an OS shell and move to Kapua project root directory
Start Docker runtime
Start Kapua:
On Linux/MacOS:
./deployment/docker/unix/docker-deploy.sh
On Windows (PowerShell):
./deployment/docker/win/docker-deploy.ps1
The command starts all the Kapua containers using Docker Compose.
By default, the latest version of images will be used. If you want to run some other version of Kapua, set the IMAGE_VERSION environment variable, for example:
export IMAGE_VERSION=0.2.0
You can check if the containers are running by typing the following command:
docker ps -as
Docker will list the containers currently running.

Pure node client for Kapua from SwiftSense
On Linux/MacOS:
./deployment/docker/unix/docker-undeploy.sh
On Windows (PowerShell):
./deployment/docker/win/docker-undeploy.ps1
Access
Once the containers are running, the Kapua services can be accessed. Eclipse Kapua™ is a multi tenant
system. The demo installation comes with one default tenant, called kapua-sys, which is also the root tenant.
In Eclipse Kapua™ a tenant is commonly referred to as an account.
The console
The administration console is available at http://localhost:8080/.
Copy paste the URL above to a Web browser, as the login screen appears, type the following credentials:
Username: kapua-sys
Password: kapua-password
Press Login button and start working with the console.
Note: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be localhost but

RESTful APIs
The documentation of RESTful API is available at http://localhost:8081/doc/ while the mount points are available at http://localhost:8081/v1/.
The documentation is available through Swagger UI which greatly helps testing and exploring the exposed services.
In order to get access a REST resource through an API, an authentication token is needed. Fortunately the token can be easily obtained by executing the authentication API. There are several ways to invoke the API, an easy one is by using the Swagger UI:
Open the URL http://localhost:8081/doc/
Select item Authentication
Select item /authentication/user
Using the test feature run 'POST /authentication/user' by specifying the following body:
{
"password" : [ "kapua-password" ],
"username": "kapua-sys"
}
Note: as an alternative to the previous, if curl is available on your machine, execute the following from the shell:
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/v1/authentication/user' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{

}'
The system will return a JSON object.
Copy the value of the field tokenId
Paste the value in the box labelled api_key at the top of the web page
Swagger will automatically add the authentication token to each subsequent request done using the Swagger UI. You're ready to try executing the documented APIs.
Note: If you are using Docker on Windows the hostname will most likely not be localhost but
the IP address of your docker instance.
The Broker
The broker container exposes an Mqtt end point at tcp://localhost:1883/.
The broker can be accessed through either Eclipse Kura™ or a plain Mqtt client like, for example, Eclipse Paho™.
In order for a client to establish a Mqtt connection with the broker, a client must provide a valid identity. The kapua-sys account provides the user named kapua-broker which has been pre-seeded and profiled for the purpose.
The credentials for the user kapua-broker are the following:
0.00% <0.00%> (-100.00%)

Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Currently kapua-sys user is enabled by configuration and disabling it is not allowed by business logic.
It would be nice to allow enabling/disabling such user, in order to support the following use case:
As a platform administrator I want to disable the kapua-sys user after the initial platform configuration has been carried and nominative admin users created so that further administration activities are carried out by the new users.
Describe the solution you'd like
It should be sufficient to remove the check that prevents the update of the kapua-sys user status.
Describe alternatives you've considered

Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The SSO generic-provider in Kapua requires passing various properties in order to connect properly to the OpenID Provider. However, we could simply read the well-known configuration document provided by the OpenID Provider and configure the generic-provider consequently.
The well-known configuration document is part of the OpenID specification, see here for more information.
Describe the solution you'd like
The configuration step could first try configuring by using the well-known document. Then, if this step fails, it could use the manual configuration.
Describe alternatives you've considered
An alternative could be implementing an automatic-provider dedicated to the automatic configuration through the well-known document and maintain the generic-provider as it is currently implemented for manual configuration.
Additional context
Implementing this improvement does not mean to get rid of dedicated providers, since there can be OpenID Providers that are not fully compliant with the OpenID specification and thus require a dedicated provider to be configured on Kapua.

Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The KapuaSecurityContext improvements done by #3066 need a small improvement more.
The property mechanism, instead of being hardcoded using fields, should be flexible to allow pluggability.
Describe the solution you'd like
Few properties, instead of being declared as fields, could be grouped in a properties map.
Describe alternatives you've considered

Any side note on the changes made
Exception handling has also been improved when required.
Please note that since the Kapua default logging level is info, while this PR uses debug Log4j methods, none of the info provided with this PR will be actually plotted in the log. However please note that PR #3086 introduces adjustable logging level, allowing one to set default as logging level. So, even if this PR doesn't require other PRs to be merged, it will only work when PR #3086 will be merged.

I have to list and paginate the users but I don't know how many are the total elements to display.
When I call the API to retrieve the list of users, I would like to specify the askTotalCount paremeter in order to get the totalCount of elements to paginate the results.

If the OpenID logout is disabled, the user is allowed to login again into the Kapua Console without the need to provide any credentials.

Any side note on the changes made
This feature is implemented directly inside the getSsoLogoutUri method of the GwtSettingsServiceImpl class. If the property is false, an empty string (URL) will be returned to the console on the browser side, and the call to the logout endpoint won't be performed. This simple approach has been preferred to the use of a dedicated callback, in order to avoid having too many nested callbacks.
Enabling property to disable the OpenID Connect logout

Two changes about REST APIs in this PR:
WADL generation when issuing an OPTIONS HTTP request has been disabled
CORSResponseFilter, that was moved in Shiro with #2855, has been refactored to be a standalone Filter, since it's more logical. It will still be executed before the Shiro filter anyway, so the logic of that change is preserved.

Fix running-page grammatical errors
No related issue
Description of the solution adopted
A new matchTerm query parameter is now available in Devices REST API. This query parameter will convert the value in a MatchPredicate. A MatchPredicate is a new kind of predicate that will match all the entities where at least one of the fields, that are hardcoded in every MatchPredicate implementation, starts with the provided value, case insensitive.
For DeviceMatchPredicate the following fields will be evaluated:
CLIENT_ID
DISPLAY_NAME
SERIAL_NUMBER
MODEL_ID
MODEL_NAME
BIOS_VERSION
FIRMWARE_VERSION
OS_VERSION
JVM_VERSION
OSGI_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
APPLICATION_FRAMEWORK_VERSION

Add MQTT connector for internal use (Console, RestAPI).
This pr enhance the security since now the Kapua components don't need to know a real user to connect to the broker and is a step forward toward the adoption of AMQP as inter-components communication standard.
The new connector will use the 1893 port as defalt.
Anyway, as for the other connectors, is customizable.

Hi @sonja-ct ,
I've made some comments. I've commented only first occurrence of many things, but I would like to have that fixed on all places (i.e: all places where:
EventStoreRecordImpl eventStoreRecordImpl = new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId);
assertNotNull("Null not expected.", eventStoreRecordImpl);
is done.
There is also a question on why EntityManager has been mocked.
Thanks,
Alberto

Thanks for the submission @xshiart!
I would kindly ask for a few changes, and also it would be great if you could update the OpenAPI specification under rest-api/resources/src/main/resources/openapi.
I'll gladly merge this as soon as it's ready!

Describe the bug
The run-console script is checking for the presence of five variables in order to trigger the generic OpenID Connect (SSO) provider. However, only CONSOLE_URL and OPENID_JWT_ISSUER must actually be checked, since the other variables are retrieved trough the well-known configuration document, and should only be provided in particular cases.

This test is always true.
Is not possible to have a null object after a new, and if new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId) goes on exception, this assertNotNull is not executed.

@sonja-ct I suggest that you check here if the created object is of right instance (for example we are expecting "X" instance and if in future this changes so the method returns instance of an object "Y" we will have a test that will check this.
assertNotNull is generally used only when you ahve two outcomes, Null and some not null value. It can also be a part of some assertion list (several assertions that check various things). I agree with @Coduz on this one.

New "plug-ins" module and SSO renaming
#2791
Open
Coduz
When having an high number of DeviceEvents for a Device, the retrieval performance degrades over time with increasing of the DeviceEvents present.
Looking at a deployment that contained ~70000 DeviceEvents for a Device, the retrieval takes more than 30s. Executing some SQL queries it appears that SORTing by received_on DESC takes the most time. Running the same query without SORTing is much faster.
Looking at the table definition the received on is not one of the indexed fields so that's the reason why it takes so long, since for each query to the DeviceEvents table it requires the sorting of the whole result set after the filtering of the WHERE clause.
To Reproduce
Create a device and add a lot of Device Events to that device (e.g. 70000), it does not matter the content.
Query the table with ordering by received_on, which is the default sorting of DeviceEvents, and look at the time that it takes. Run the same query without sorting and the query takes a lot less time.
This behaviour can be seen also by simply running SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DVC_DEVICE_EVENTS with and without the SORT BY.
Expected behavior
The queries must be much more performant! We should include the received_on field in the indexes.

If you connect live Kura device to Kapua, "Packages" tab gets activated, which is OK. But the problem is that the "log" button is active and does nothing when clicked on.
Testflow
Login as kapua-sys or any other user that has proper permissions
Connect a live Kura device to Kapua and go to Devices > Packages
Try clicking on "Log" button and observe the result
Expected behavior
"Log" button should be disabled if there is nothing to show or should show something when clicked.
Screenshot:

But a result of a new is always a notNull object, unless Exception, which is not covered anyway by this assertNotNull. This is the same thing as writing assertTrue(true).
If new returns a null, well Java must be a bit stoned or something 😂

Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Normal paging with limit and offset is not suitable for device events browsing.
Describe the solution you'd like
The endpoint to retrieve the device events should provide parameters to filter the events according to a time interval.
Something like startDate and endDate should be ok (same params used in the dataMessage endpoint)
Describe alternatives you've considered
None.

I wouldn't also mind to check for the right instance type.
Doing:
EventStoreRecordImpl eventStoreRecordImpl = new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId);
assertTrue(eventStoreRecordImpl instence of EventStoreRecordImpl)
is useless for the same reasons.
Also this:
EventStoreRecordImpl eventStoreRecordImpl = new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId);
assertTrue(eventStoreRecordImpl instence of EventStoreRecord)
is useless. In both cases, if that isn't true ClassCastException would be thrown when assigning the new result to the local variable.
...st/java/org/eclipse/kapua/commons/service/event/store/internal/EventStoreRecordImplTest.java

String contextId = "ContextId";
for (KapuaId scopeId : scopeIdList) {
EventStoreRecordImpl eventStoreRecordImpl1 = new EventStoreRecordImpl(scopeId);
assertNull("Null expected.", eventStoreRecordImpl1.getContextId());

I have updated the "build" badges - one is now called "Jenkins build" and other one "Travis build".
Any thoughts or ideas from the community? Should we add other badges as well?

I fixed the Getting Started guide adding Git as a prerequisite, fixing the Unix script path and adding the Windows quickstart. As per the Kura image, it's not on the server anymore, so I removed the reference.

This PR refactors the Storable API and its base implementation.
Currently all Storable API (used for Elasticsearch enabled services) are contained into kapua-datastore-api and kapua-datastore-internal which make reuse of them not clean since you have to depend on datastore modules instead of common modules.
Related Issue
None
Description of the solution adopted
Moved Storable API clases to kapua-service-api module.
Moved Storable base implementation classes to a new module kapua-service-storable
Improved the implementation with some goodies added to the KapuaEntity-enabled classes but were not ported to the Storable API.
Examples:
ListResult.getFirstItem()

This PR enables two options on the nexus-staging-maven-plugin that enables the keeping of the staging repository when a failure occurs.
Related Issue
None
Description of the solution adopted
Enabled keepStagingRepositoryOnFailure and keepStagingRepositoryOnCloseRuleFailure which change the default behaviour of the plugin which is to delete the staging repo in case of failure.
This is beneficial for two reasons:
in case of error the staging repository can be inspected and info will be available, otherwise they will be lost
for Kapua 1.2.0 there was an issue on Sonatype due to degraded performances which made the checking of the rule exceed the timeout that the plugin expect for the task to complete. This was making the build fail even if it was fine and only slow to complete. See also BugZilla issue 564077

Description of the solution adopted
This PR refactors the Kapua Elasticsearch client to improve reusability of it.
Currently is bound to the Datastore API and Implementation and can have only one configuration.
If another KapuaService wants to use the ES store, it cannot provide another configuration (URL, indexing, etc.)
This PR allows the client to have multiple instances of it with different configuration for each one of it.

Bumper to the latest 4.1.x version available.
NO CQ needed while on the same patch release.
CQ for the 4.1.34.Final version here
Each single submodule of Netty 4 has been defined in the dependencyManagement of the root pom.xml so we can match any usages by other dependencies (i.e. Elasticsearch Transport).
Below mvn dependency:tree command issued against develop and this branch.
dependency tree - develop.txt

Netty 3 is still in use by org.elasticsearch.plugin:transport-netty3-client bu t is set on the latest version available. It will be removed when we will drop transport-netty3-client usage.
Branch is named 4.1.45.Final because it was the latest available version at the I created the branch.

The clone method has been already been tested in eventStoreRecordImplTest3, if I'm correct.
So also this is not needed.

@Coduz here we are checking if the contextId is null and in the "eventStoreRecordImplTest3" we check if the expected and actual values are the same, so these are two different cases. If I am seeing right.

hey @henry-lp,
when trying to build your branch, I discovered that you have some checkstyle violations:
Output is:
[ERROR] rest-api/resources/src/test/java/org/eclipse/kapua/app/api/resources/v1/resources/TagsTests.java:[11,27] (whitespace) MethodParamPad: '(' is preceded with whitespace.
[ERROR] rest-api/resources/src/test/java/org/eclipse/kapua/app/api/resources/v1/resources/TagsTests.java:[14] (whitespace) EmptyLineSeparator: There is more than 1 empty line one after another.
can you please check? Just run mvn clean install -DskipTests on your branch.

@LeoNerdoG ,
Thanks for pointing out :) . For some reasons I only see this checkstyle error at my local branch after pulling the newest changes
After fixing it I ran mvn clean install -DskipTests and it seems to be green at least.

@Coduz we should always mock as much methods as possible to isolate unit test as much as possible.
We don't want actual implementation of other methods to imterfere with our Unit tests.

@sonja-ct I suggest that you check here if the created object is of right instance (for example we are expecting "X" instance and if in future this changes so the method returns instance of an object "Y" we will have a test that will check this.
assertNotNull is generally used only when you ahve two outcomes, Null and some not null value. It can also be a part of some assertion list (several assertions that check various things). I agree with @Coduz on this one.

@Coduz we should always mock as much methods as possible to isolate unit test as much as possible.
We don't want actual implementation of other methods to imterfere with our Unit tests.

Henry

EclipseLink JaxbContextFactory is currently not forced on the REST APIs. This can cause troubles with CORS and in general every time a non-application error is thrown by the REST APIs.

improvements regarding code quality e.g. improving readability, performance, modularity etc.
documentation (Getting Started guide, Examples, Deployment instructions in cloud environments)
features (both ideas and code are welcome)
In order to get you started as fast as possible we need to go through some organizational issues first, though.
Legal Requirements
Kapua is an Eclipse IoT project and as such is governed by the Eclipse Development process.
This process helps us in creating great open source software within a safe legal framework.
For you as a contributor, the following preliminary steps are required in order for us to be able to accept your contribution:
Sign the Eclipse Foundation Contributor License Agreement.
In order to do so:
Obtain an Eclipse Foundation user ID. Anyone who currently uses Eclipse Bugzilla or Gerrit systems already has one of those.
If you don't already have an account simply register on the Eclipse web site.
Once you have your account, log in to the projects portal, select My Account and then the Contributor License Agreement tab.
Add your GiHub username to your Eclipse Foundation account. Log in to Eclipse and go to Edit my account.
The easiest way to contribute code/patches/whatever is by creating a GitHub pull request (PR). When you do make sure that you Sign-off your commit records using the same email address used for your Eclipse account.
You do this by adding the -s flag when you make the commit(s), e.g.
$> git commit -s -m "Shave the yak some more"
Description of the solution adopted
The process to create a cache instance involves the creation of a CachingProvider and a CacheManager.
The previous implementation creates a new instance of both of them for each cache instantiation.
Now the CachingProvider and CacheManager are instantiated once and kept as reference for the further getCache invocations.
This is perfectly allowed and shouldn't change any cache behavior since from CachingProvider.getCacheManager method javadoc (JCache specification):
"Requests a CacheManager configured according to the implementation specific URI that uses the provided ClassLoader for loading underlying classes.
Multiple calls to this method with the same URI and ClassLoader must return the same CacheManager instance, except if a previously returned CacheManager has been closed."

Hello, I need to deploy kapua in an environment with other docker images running, so I need to change the port number of some Kapua services (in the docker compose). I think that now, I have to specify to the other services the new port. Is it right?
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
what services are you going to change?
RiccardoFelicetti
@RiccardoFelicetti
Can I do this with some environment variables on the compose file? Where can I find the name of the variables? thanks

Hello, I connected a kura emulator (eclipse workspace) with a Kapua instance deployed on a machine with a nginx in the middle. So, after the configuration I'm able to connect Kura and kapua but I cannot access the configuration tab of the device in kapua console.
I receive this message: ErrorSelected device not connected. Please refresh device list.
and I cannot click on the command tab
Do you think that is a configuration problem on the proxy or something else?
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
uhm...

@lorthirk
can you do any management?
let's say, command? bundles?
ok, management is not an issue per se
i would tell you to have a look at the Kura logs

I can stop and start a bundle for example
The command tab instead is "unclickable"

I'm with the emulator in the eclipse workspace
the version isKURA_4.1.1
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
uhm... I would try with a Kura emulator in a Docker container
I don't know much about the Eclipse Workspace emulator, probably you may have better luck in the eclipse/kura channel
RiccardoFelicetti
@RiccardoFelicetti
ok, so i think that is not a problem of proxy/network configuration

ok thank you

Just a quick question, Kura supports JSON format on CloudService, but does Kapua process this data to fill Data tab? It seems like only protobuf information is being processed
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
no, Kapua does not support Kura's Simple JSON format
or, well, it does but does not convert the message to metrics
so the entire message is stored in the message body, and the Console will not render it
I think the API does though

Hello, I need to deploy kapua in an environment with other docker images running, so I need to change the port number of some Kapua services (in the docker compose). I think that now, I have to specify to the other services the new port. Is it right?
Claudio Mezzasalma
@lorthirk
what services are you going to change?
RiccardoFelicetti
@RiccardoFelicetti
Can I do this with some environment variables on the compose file? Where can I find the name of the variables? thanks

Hello, I connected a kura emulator (eclipse workspace) with a Kapua instance deployed on a machine with a nginx in the middle. So, after the configuration I'm able to connect Kura and kapua but I cannot access the configuration tab of the device in kapua console.

Description of the solution adopted
Recently the old method of sourcing the maven.tar.gz from mirrors and installing it manually had some issues with downloading the file.

Just a quick question, Kura supports JSON format on CloudService, but does Kapua process this data to fill Data tab? It seems like only protobuf information is being processed

no, Kapua does not support Kura's Simple JSON format
or, well, it does but does not convert the message to metrics
so the entire message is stored in the message body, and the Console will not render it
I think the API does though

This PR increases the limits for TextFields and TextAreas in the Device Configuration Tab.
New limits are:
TextFields: 1024
TextAreas: 2097152 (2M)
Related Issue
This PR fixes #3002
Also solves problem reported by @cdealti
Description of the solution adopted
Just increased the limits for the max length of the fields and their validator.
Removed the part which was setting custom length for some fields referencing them by name, which was definitely not a good solution since DeviceConfiguration are not well known and user can create/use big values in any component.

I have noticed, that user gets logged out of the console 20 seconds after the login happens - regardless if user clicks something or not.
Testflow:
Login as kapua-sys
Wait for 20 seconds and then try to click something (e.g. Settings)
Observe the error "You are not logged in"
Expected behavior
User should not get logged out automatically after 20 seconds.

I noticed that when you keep both Kapua and Kura tabs, and they both are running on the same domain (e.g. localhost), Kapua reports a logout almost immediately. I think there must be come conflict with the Session Cookie or something.

The issue seems to be happening also when the same configuration is applied through the batch jobs, but this has not been extensively tested.
The REST API has not been tested
The WireGraph component seems to be working perfectly fine despite of this issue and its field is a string with more than 256 characters

I have recently started playing around with Kapua and kura in docker and can confirm I have seen the same annoying effect, where the user gets logged out of the console a few seconds after the login happens.
After seeing this issue and closing the Kura [docker] Tab, this issue goes away.

Hey @lorthirk, just a heads up: I have noticed that the headers are not updated to current year (2020). Because this is a stall PR i suggest to update the header year right before the merge, to avoid changing them multiple times in case the PR is prolonged into 2021.

This PR is going to be merged in a few days, if not hours. I will try to update all the headers for the modified files if I find a quick way to do that.
