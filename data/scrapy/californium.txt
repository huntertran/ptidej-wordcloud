CoAP in Java
CoAP in Java
Californium is a powerful CoAP framework targeting back-end services communicating with smaller Internet of Things devices. Stronger Internet of Things devices may use Californium as well. It provides a convenient API for RESTful Web services that support all of CoAP’s features.
Standards compliant
Standards compliant
Californium has been running code for the IETF and is passing all ETSI Plugtest test specifications.
Perfect for IoT cloud services
Perfect for IoT cloud services
Californium has an extremely scalable architecture and outperforms high-performance HTTP servers. CoAP’s low overhead allows to handle millions of IoT devices with a single service instance. The flexible concurrency model allows to implement whatever is best for your application.
Californium (Cf) Core
The project is divided into five sub-projects. The Californium (Cf) Core provides the central framework with the protocol implementation to build your Internet of Things applications. The repository also includes example projects to get you started. All Californium sources are hosted on GitHub, so you can easily contribute through pull requests.
Californium (Cf) is dual-licensed under EPL and EDL. The latter is a BSD-like license, which means the Cf CoAP framework can be used together with proprietary code to implement your IoT product!
Cf is available from Maven Central and very easy to consume in your Java project. We have got your back covered from OSGi wrapper to HTTP-CoAP cross-proxy to advanced test suites that have been used at the ETSI Plugtests.
Repository
Scandium (Sc)
The Scandium (Sc) sub-module provides security for Californium. It implements DTLS 1.2 to secure your application through ECC with pre-shared keys, certificates, or raw public keys.
Repository
Actinium (Ac)
Actinium (Ac) is the app-server for Californium to realize IoT mashups! Your JavaScript apps become available as RESTful resources and can directly talk to IoT devices using our CoapRequest object API.
Repository
Getting Started
Learn how to use Californium
The Internet of Things if growing, but how can you build your own connected objects? Together with MQTT, CoAP is one of the popular IoT protocols. It provides answers to the typical IoT constraints: it is bandwidth efficient and fits in constrained embedded environment while providing friendly and discoverable RESTful API.

Use
mvn clean install
in the root directory to build the tools. It requires at least a Java 8 SDK. The standalone JARs will be created in the
run
folder.
e.g. run with
java -jar cf-client-*.jar
.
Note: Building
cf-browser
using Java 8 requires the JavaFX libraries to be available on the system class path. Oracle's JDK includes the JavaFX libraries by default. OpenJDK does not and OpenJFX must be installed separately.
For instructions regarding the usage of OpenJFX on Java 11 and later, refer to the
OpenJFX documentation
. On OpenJDK 8 the availability of OpenJFX depends on the linux distribution you are using. Later versions of Ubunut do no longer seem to provide OpenJFX for OpenJDK 8. May be the workaround described in this

Version 2.0 is now based on Nashorn and provides module loading mechanism
Our novel runtime container Actinium (Ac) exposes scripts, their configuration, and their lifecycle management through a RESTful programming interface using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). We endow the JavaScript language with an API for direct interaction with mote-class IoT devices, the CoapRequest object, and means to export script data as Web resources. With Actinium, applications can be created by simply mashing up resources provided by CoAP servers on devices, other scripts, and classic Web services.
Maven
Actinium can only be built using JDK 1.8 because of its dependencies to some JDK internal classes (you are more than welcome to help us getting rid of them). Use
mvn clean install
in the root directory to build the Actinium (Ac) server. A standalone JAR will be created in the ./run/ directory.
The dependencies are available from the default Maven repositories.
Run with
java -jar actinium-*.jar
.

Installing a New App
Send a POST with JavaScript code to
install?[appname]
where [appname] is used as (file)name for the app code.
Example:
The example app ist stored in
./appserver/installed/
as
helloWorld.js
. The server now has a new resource /install/helloWorld.

Evolving the SessionCache
Send a POST with "name=[instance name]" to /install/helloWorld where [instance name] is used as name of the instance as well as filename for the configuration. You can instantiate an installed app several times by choosing different instance names.
Example:
The example instance is stored in
./appserver/apps/
as
config_hello-1.cfg
. The server now has two new resources, /apps/appconfigs/hello-1 to change the configuration of the instance and /apps/running/hello-1 to interact with the running app.
Communicating With a Running App
Configuring an App Instance
Some of the instance properties can be changed during runtime, some are fixed (e.g., the name). The changes are committed to the config resource of the app under /apps/appconfigs/. For this, use a POST with
key = value
pairs as payload to update existing keys. Use PUT to clear all existing keys and start fresh with the keys in the PUT payload.
There are also three special commands to control the running instance via POST:
start
,
restart

Eclipse Californium is a Java implementation of
RFC7252 - Constrained Application Protocol
for IoT Cloud services. Thus, the focus is on scalability and usability instead of resource-efficiency like for embedded devices. Yet Californium is also suitable for embedded JVMs.
More information can be found at
http://www.eclipse.org/californium/
and
http://coap.technology/
.
Build using Maven
You need to have a working maven installation to build Californium. Then simply run the following from the project's root directory:
Executable JARs of the examples with all dependencies can be found in the
demo-apps/run
folder.
The build-process is tested for jdk 7, jdk 8 and jdk 11. For jdk 7 the revapi maven-plugin is disabled, it requires at least java 8.

To generate the javadocs, add "-DcreateJavadoc=true" to the command line and set the
JAVA_HOME
.
Californium 2.x can be used with java 7 or newer. If you want to build it with a jdk 7, but use also plugins which are only supported for newer jdks, the toolchain plugin could be used. That requires a toolchains configuration in "toolchains.xml" in your maven ".m2" folder
To use the jdk7 toolchain, add "-DuseToolchain=true" to the command line.
To use the jdk7 toolchain and create javadocs, add "-DuseToolchainJavadoc=true" to the command line (
JAVA_HOME
is not required).
Using Californium in Maven Projects
We are publishing Californium's artifacts for milestones and releases to
Maven Central
. To use the latest released version as a library in your projects, add the following dependency to your
pom.xml
(without the dots):
Current Builds
You can also be bold and try out the most recent build from

. However, we are not publishing those to Maven Central but to Californium's project repository at Eclipse only. You will therefore need to add the Eclipse Repository to your

In IntelliJ, choose
[File.. » Open]
then select the location of the cloned repository in your filesystem. IntelliJ will then automatically import all projects and resolve required Maven dependencies.
Interop Server
A test server is running at coap://californium.eclipse.org:5683/. It is an instance of the
cf-plugtest-server
from the demo-apps. The root resource responds with its current version. More information can be found at
http://californium.eclipse.org/
.
Another interop server with a different implementation can be found at coap://coap.me:5683/. More information can be found at
http://coap.me/
.
Adapter Selection
For some systems (particularly when multicasting), it may be necessary to specify/restrict californium to a particular network interface, or interfaces. This can be achieved by setting the
COAP_NETWORK_INTERFACES
JVM parameter to a suitable regex, for example:
java -DCOAP_NETWORK_INTERFACES='.*wpan0' -jar target/cf-helloworld-server-2.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar MulticastTestServer
