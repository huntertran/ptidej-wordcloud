CoAP in Java
CoAP in Java
Californium is a powerful CoAP framework targeting back-end services communicating with smaller Internet of Things devices.
Stronger Internet of Things devices may use Californium as well.
It provides a convenient API for RESTful Web services that support all of CoAP’s features.
Standards compliant
Standards compliant
Californium has been running code for the IETF and is passing all ETSI Plugtest test specifications.
Perfect for IoT cloud services
Perfect for IoT cloud services
Californium has an extremely scalable architecture and outperforms high-performance HTTP servers.
CoAP’s low overhead allows to handle millions of IoT devices with a single service instance.
The flexible concurrency model allows to implement whatever is best for your application.
Californium (Cf) Core
The project is divided into five sub-projects. The Californium (Cf) Core provides the central framework with the protocol implementation to build your Internet of Things applications. The repository also includes example projects to get you started. All Californium sources are hosted on GitHub, so you can easily contribute through pull requests.
Californium (Cf) is dual-licensed under EPL and EDL. The latter is a BSD-like license, which means the Cf CoAP framework can be used together with proprietary code to implement your IoT product!
Cf is available from Maven Central and very easy to consume in your Java project. We have got your back covered from OSGi wrapper to HTTP-CoAP cross-proxy to advanced test suites that have been used at the ETSI Plugtests.
Repository
Scandium (Sc)
The Scandium (Sc) sub-module provides security for Californium. It implements DTLS 1.2 to secure your application
through ECC with pre-shared keys, certificates, or raw public keys.
Repository
Actinium (Ac)
Actinium (Ac) is the app-server for Californium to realize IoT mashups! Your JavaScript apps become available as RESTful resources and can directly talk to IoT devices using our CoapRequest object API.
Repository
Getting Started
Learn how to use Californium
The Internet of Things if growing, but how can you build your own connected objects?
Together with MQTT, CoAP is one of the popular IoT protocols.
It provides answers to the typical IoT constraints: it is bandwidth efficient and fits
in constrained embedded environment while providing friendly and discoverable RESTful API.

The element-connector abstracts from the different transports CoAP can use.
It provides the basic UDPConnector as well as the interface to implement new connectors like the DtlsConnector of Scandium.
Tools
Tools
This repository provides CoAP tools that also serve as examples. Use CoAPBench to benchmark your CoAP solutions or simply use our cf-client to interact with your devices from the command line.

Actinium (Ac) App-server 2.0 for Californium
Version 2.0 is now based on Nashorn and provides module loading mechanism
Our novel runtime container Actinium (Ac) exposes scripts, their configuration, and their lifecycle management through a RESTful programming interface using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).
We endow the JavaScript language with an API for direct interaction with mote-class IoT devices, the CoapRequest object, and means to export script data as Web resources.
With Actinium, applications can be created by simply mashing up resources provided by CoAP servers on devices, other scripts, and classic Web services.
Maven
Actinium can only be built using JDK 1.8 because of its dependencies to some JDK internal classes
(you are more than welcome to help us getting rid of them).
Use mvn clean install in the root directory to build the Actinium (Ac) server.
A standalone JAR will be created in the ./run/ directory.
The dependencies are available from the default Maven repositories.
Run with java -jar actinium-*.jar.
If newer JDKs are used to run maven, -DuseToolchain can be used to switch back to the required JDK 1.8

request.respond(2.05, "Hello World");
}
Response: Application appname successfully installed to /install/helloWorld
The example app ist stored in ./appserver/installed/ as helloWorld.js.
The server now has a new resource /install/helloWorld.
Starting a New App Instance
Send a POST with "name=[instance name]" to /install/helloWorld where
[instance name] is used as name of the instance as well as filename for the
configuration. You can instantiate an installed app several times by choosing
different instance names.
Example:
Request: POST coap://localhost:5683/install/helloWorld
Payload: name=hello-1
Response: Application hello-1 successfully installed to /apps/running/hello-1
The example instance is stored in ./appserver/apps/ as config_hello-1.cfg.
The server now has two new resources, /apps/appconfigs/hello-1 to change the
configuration of the instance and /apps/running/hello-1 to interact with the
running app.
Communicating With a Running App
Send GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE to a resource under /apps/running/ depending on
Configuring an App Instance

(e.g., the name). The changes are committed to the config resource of the app
under /apps/appconfigs/. For this, use a POST with key = value pairs as
payload to update existing keys. Use PUT to clear all existing keys and start
fresh with the keys in the PUT payload.
There are also three special commands to control the running instance via POST:
start, restart, and stop.
Example:
a) Request: GET coap://localhost:5683/apps/appconfigs/hello-1
Response: All app properties
b) Request: POST coap://localhost:5683/apps/appconfigs/hello-1
Payload: enable_request_delivery = false

Maven
Use mvn clean install in the root directory to build the tools. It requires at least a Java 8 SDK. The standalone JARs will be created in the run folder.
e.g. run with java -jar cf-client-*.jar.
Note: Building cf-browser using Java 8 requires the JavaFX libraries to be available on the system class path.
Oracle's JDK includes the JavaFX libraries by default. OpenJDK does not and OpenJFX must be installed separately.
For instructions regarding the usage of OpenJFX on Java 11 and later, refer to the OpenJFX documentation.
On OpenJDK 8 the availability of OpenJFX depends on the linux distribution you are using. Later versions of Ubuntu seems to not longer provide OpenJFX for OpenJDK 8. Maybe the workaround described in this GitHub issue
works for you.

Californium (Cf) - CoAP for Java
Eclipse Californium is a Java implementation of RFC7252 - Constrained Application Protocol for IoT Cloud services. Thus, the focus is on scalability and usability instead of resource-efficiency
like for embedded devices. Yet Californium is also suitable for embedded JVMs.

Programming Your Own Apps
JavaScriptResource. They have the request as argument, which can be responded
through its respond(code, payload) method.
app.root is the root resource of your app under /apps/running/.
Example:
app.root.onget = fnc;
app.root.onpost = fnc;
app.root.onput = fnc;
app.root.ondelete = fnc;
request.respond(2.05, "Hello World");
}
Sub-resources can be added to the root resource as shown below:
res = new JavaScriptResource('mySubResource');
app.root.add(res);
You can dump information to the console through the app object:
app.dump("Hello World");
Usage
e.g. java -jar cf-browser-*.jar

Build using Maven
You need to have a working maven installation to build Californium.
Then simply run the following from the project's root directory:
$ mvn clean install
Executable JARs of the examples with all dependencies can be found in the demo-apps/run folder.
The build-process is tested for jdk 7, jdk 8 and jdk 11. For jdk 7 the revapi maven-plugin is disabled, it requires at least java 8.
To generate the javadocs, add "-DcreateJavadoc=true" to the command line and set the JAVA_HOME.
$ mvn clean install -DcreateJavadoc=true
Build jdk7 compliant
Californium 2.x can be used with java 7 or newer. If you want to build it with a jdk 7, but use also plugins which are only supported for newer jdks, the toolchain plugin could be used. That requires a toolchains configuration in "toolchains.xml" in your maven ".m2" folder
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF8"?>
<toolchains>
<!-- JDK toolchains -->
<toolchain>
<type>jdk</type>
<provides>
<version>1.7</version>

To use the jdk7 toolchain, add "-DuseToolchain=true" to the command line.
$ mvn clean install -DuseToolchain=true
To use the jdk7 toolchain and create javadocs, add "-DuseToolchainJavadoc=true" to the command line (JAVA_HOME is not required).
$ mvn clean install -DuseToolchainJavadoc=true
Build with jdk11 and EdDSA support
To support EdDSA, either java 15, or java 11 with ed25519-java is required at runtime. Using java 15 to build Californium, leaves out ed25519-java,
using java 11 for building, includes ed25519-java by default. If ed25519-java should NOT be included into the californium's jars, add -Dno.net.i2p.crypto.eddsa=true to maven's arguments.
$ mvn clean install -Dno.net.i2p.crypto.eddsa=true
In that case, it's still possible to use ed25519-java, if the eddsa-0.3.0.jar is provided to the classpath separately.
Using Californium in Maven Projects
We are publishing Californium's artifacts for milestones and releases to Maven Central.
To use the latest released version as a library in your projects, add the following dependency
to your pom.xml (without the dots):
<dependencies>
...
<dependency>
<groupId>org.eclipse.californium</groupId>
<artifactId>californium-core</artifactId>
<version>2.5.0</version>

Current Builds
You can also be bold and try out the most recent build from master.
However, we are not publishing those to Maven Central but to Californium's project repository at Eclipse only.
You will therefore need to add the Eclipse Repository to your pom.xml first:
<repositories>
...
<repository>
<id>repo.eclipse.org</id>
<name>Californium Repository</name>
<url>https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/californium/</url>
</repository>
...
</repositories>
You can then simply depend on 2.6.0-SNAPSHOT.
Eclipse
The project can be easily imported into a recent version of the Eclipse IDE.
Make sure to have the following before importing the Californium (Cf) projects:
Eclipse EGit (should be the case with every recent Eclipse version)
m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse (should be the case with every recent Eclipse version)
UTF-8 workspace text file encoding (Preferences » General » Workspace)
Then choose [Import... » Maven » Existing Maven Projects] to import californium into Eclipse.
IntelliJ
The project can also be imported to IntelliJ as follows:
In IntelliJ, choose [File.. » Open] then select the location of the cloned repository in your filesystem. IntelliJ will then automatically import all projects and resolve required Maven dependencies.

Interop Server
A test server is running at coap://californium.eclipse.org:5683/.
It is an instance of the cf-plugtest-server from the demo-apps.
The root resource responds with its current version.
More information can be found at http://californium.eclipse.org/.
Another interop server with a different implementation can be found at
coap://coap.me:5683/.
More information can be found at http://coap.me/.
Adapter Selection
For some systems (particularly when multicasting), it may be necessary to specify/restrict californium to a particular network interface, or interfaces. This can be
achieved by setting the COAP_NETWORK_INTERFACES JVM parameter to a suitable regex, for example:
java -DCOAP_NETWORK_INTERFACES='.*wpan0' -jar target/cf-helloworld-server-2.5.0.jar MulticastTestServer

CoAP in Java
CoAP in Java
Californium is a powerful CoAP framework targeting back-end services communicating with smaller Internet of Things devices.
Stronger Internet of Things devices may use Californium as well.
It provides a convenient API for RESTful Web services that support all of CoAP’s features.
Standards compliant
Standards compliant
Californium has been running code for the IETF and is passing all ETSI Plugtest test specifications.
Perfect for IoT cloud services
Perfect for IoT cloud services
Californium has an extremely scalable architecture and outperforms high-performance HTTP servers.
CoAP’s low overhead allows to handle millions of IoT devices with a single service instance.
The flexible concurrency model allows to implement whatever is best for your application.
Californium (Cf) Core
The project is divided into five sub-projects. The Californium (Cf) Core provides the central framework with the protocol implementation to build your Internet of Things applications. The repository also includes example projects to get you started. All Californium sources are hosted on GitHub, so you can easily contribute through pull requests.
Californium (Cf) is dual-licensed under EPL and EDL. The latter is a BSD-like license, which means the Cf CoAP framework can be used together with proprietary code to implement your IoT product!
Cf is available from Maven Central and very easy to consume in your Java project. We have got your back covered from OSGi wrapper to HTTP-CoAP cross-proxy to advanced test suites that have been used at the ETSI Plugtests.
Repository
Scandium (Sc)
The Scandium (Sc) sub-module provides security for Californium. It implements DTLS 1.2 to secure your application
through ECC with pre-shared keys, certificates, or raw public keys.
Repository
Actinium (Ac)
Actinium (Ac) is the app-server for Californium to realize IoT mashups! Your JavaScript apps become available as RESTful resources and can directly talk to IoT devices using our CoapRequest object API.

Getting Started
Learn how to use Californium
The Internet of Things if growing, but how can you build your own connected objects?
Together with MQTT, CoAP is one of the popular IoT protocols.
It provides answers to the typical IoT constraints: it is bandwidth efficient and fits
in constrained embedded environment while providing friendly and discoverable RESTful API.

The element-connector abstracts from the different transports CoAP can use.
It provides the basic UDPConnector as well as the interface to implement new connectors like the DtlsConnector of Scandium.
Tools
Tools
This repository provides CoAP tools that also serve as examples. Use CoAPBench to benchmark your CoAP solutions or simply use our cf-client to interact with your devices from the command line.
