OPC Unified Architecture is an interoperability standard that enables the secure and reliable exchange of industrial automation data while remaining cross-platform and vendor neutral. The specification, currently version 1.03, is developed and maintained by the OPC Foundation with the guidance of individual software developers, industry vendors, and end-users. It defines the interface between Clients and Servers, including access to real-time data, monitoring of alarms and events, historical data access, and data modeling.

Type: ReleaseState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, December 21, 2016Project: Eclipse MiloRelease:

Milo is an open-source implementation of OPC-UA. It includes a high-performance stack (channels, serialization, data structures, security) as well as client and server SDKs built on top of the stack.
[1] https://github.com/digitalpetri
Standards: Eclipse Milo does implement the binary protocol of OPC UA also know as IEC 62541. It will provide client and server SDK beside the core protocol stack.
Communities: Eclipse Milo does have an active user base coming from the original project at "digitalpetri". It was presented as a new project during EclipseCon Europe 2016 and several IoT projects are interested in interfacing or integrating Eclipse Milo.
0.5.0 | projects.eclipse.org
During the first release a new commiter was added to the project.
Due to the fact that Milo is a library/module with no direct end user involvement it is hard to give any details about end user activities.
The community is working on GitHub at https://github.com/eclipse/milo.

a SDK built on the stack that enables development of compliant UA client and server applications.
The separation between stack and SDK may seem arbitrary at first, but the distinction is common within the OPC-UA community and vendors as it allows SDKs that serve different needs to be built upon a common stack.

Review Information(active tab)
Milo is an open-source implementation of OPC-UA. It includes a high-performance stack (channels, serialization, data structures, security) as well as client and server SDKs built on top of the stack.
[1] https://github.com/digitalpetri
Standards: Eclipse Milo does implement the binary protocol of OPC UA also know as IEC 62541. It will provide client and server SDK beside the core protocol stack.
Communities: Eclipse Milo does have an active user base coming from the original project at "digitalpetri". It was presented as a new project during EclipseCon Europe 2016 and several IoT projects are interested in interfacing or integrating Eclipse Milo.
During the first release a new commiter was added to the project.
Due to the fact that Milo is a library/module with no direct end user involvement it is hard to give any details about end user activities.
The community is working on GitHub at https://github.com/eclipse/milo.

Review Information
Release Date: Wednesday, December 7, 2016Deliverables: Eclipse Milo will provide an implementation of the binary protocol stack in Java 8. And based on top of that it will provide a client and server SDK.
Artifacts will be published to Maven Central as OSGi bundles.
Compatibility: As this is the initial release under the Eclipse Foundation the API breaks with the original namespace. Also did the version got reset to 0.1.0. This does mean that the API is not backwards compatible with previous releases outside of Eclipse. But it has been refactored in a way that future release can be API compatible again.
Target Environments: The target environment of Milo is Java 8 SE. There is no OS dependencies.

Milo
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse IoT
Background: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) often refers to the idea of connectivity and interoperability between machinery found in the manufacturing industry. IIoT represents a significant opportunity to improve the efficiency of industrial automation processes and in other industries in general. A key challenge for IIoT is the wide and diverse nature of the devices, equipment, software and vendors that comprise the industrial ecosystem.
OPC-UA is an important standard in the industrial automation industry, ensuring interoperability between the many different types of machinery and software. OPC was initially release in 1996 but has evolved over time to become a flexibile and open standard called OPC-UA. OPC-UA has become one of the key standards behind the Industry 4.0 initiative in Europe and more specifically in Germany. It's also beginning to see traction in the United States.

The project provides:
a stack implementation, compatible with the latest version (1.03) of the UA specifications.
a SDK built on the stack that enables development of compliant UA client and server applications.
The separation between stack and SDK may seem arbitrary at first, but the distinction is common within the OPC-UA community and vendors as it allows SDKs that serve different needs to be built upon a common stack.
Description: OPC Unified Architecture is an interoperability standard that enables the secure and reliable exchange of industrial automation data while remaining cross-platform and vendor neutral. The specification, currently version 1.03, is developed and maintained by the OPC Foundation with the guidance of individual software developers, industry vendors, and end-users. It defines the interface between Clients and Servers, including access to real-time data, monitoring of alarms and events, historical data access, and data modeling.
Why Here?: The OPC Foundation has been positioning OPC-UA as a contending protocol in the IIoT space, and seeing successful adoption, making it a natural fit for the Eclipse IoT ecosystem.
Licenses: Eclipse Distribution License 1.0 (BSD)Eclipse Public License 1.0Legal Issues: The stack is currently licensed under Apache and the SDKs under AGPL. All of the copyright and IP is owned by me. Whatever bureaucracy exists around transferring and changing licensing will need be executed.
Project Scheduling: The initial contribution is ready.
I expect that a production ready "1.0" release of all projects could be ready in either Q2 or Q3 of 2016.

Prosys Comparison
Submitted by Jan Wedel on Fri, 2016-03-18 03:30
Hi,
also coming from Bosch SI, we are currently using the commercial Prosys SDK and I think your contribution is very valuable to the community.
I would be interested in:
What are the feature of Milo compared to the Prosys lib? Are you planning on a comparison chart?
How much effort (measured in complexity, not time) would it be to switch from Prosys to Milo in the future (Ranging from drop-in replacement to completely different architecture)?
Thanks,
Jan

I think building a comparison chart is a good idea. I'm going to look at the Prosys SDK again, but I imagine there should be fairly good feature parity.
As far as effort for switching - it won't be drop in and the effort to swtich will depend on if you're talking about a client or server implementation. The client will be much easier to port. The server a little more work. I am not very familiar with the abtraction they've chosen to manage and expose nodes, so I don't know what effort will be involved yet.

just found you in this project.
I'd also like to be added as interested party.
I'f also like to state that we use Kevin implementation (fresh from github) in our eclipse plugin (http://toem.de/index.php/projects/impulse/articles/99-access-opc-ua-devices-with-eclipse-impulse) and are quite happy with it !

Hi Kevin,
I'm happy to find the project. I tried the server example and it's very promising.
Could you please add "Achtwerk GmbH" as an interested party please?
What I'm looking for is to generate events and alarms from an OPC UA server application. Will this become part of the project in near future?
Best regards
