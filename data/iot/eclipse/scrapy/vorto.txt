@kolotu
Hi @oscarfh yes the documentation is still up to date - I just tried it and was not able to reproduce your issue. Could you please double check your configuration - especially your Github client ID and client secret?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
Hi @kolotu, thanks for your reply.
I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet
# Repository
DATASOURCE=mysql
AUTH_PROVIDER=github
ADMIN_USER=oscarfh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
EIDP_CLIENT_ID=
EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Vorto DashboardYou need to enable JavaScript to run this app.
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values
oscarfh
@oscarfh
I will try as soon as I can and get back to you
oscarfh
@oscarfh
I made the changes but still no luck :(
oscarfh
@oscarfh
@kolotu I found out: I am using a VPN for access, which reduces strongly my internet speed. It seems that it is timing out (works perfectly if I unplug the VPN). Is there any way for me to change the timeout period?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
eclipse/vorto - Gitter
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option
oscarfh
@oscarfh
Ok, thanks a lot!

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I don't have a table called modeshape_repository. :(

oh okay - let me check what the configuration in the container is. the repository can also be placed on the filesystem

I have to run, but I see run.py is referencing a application.yml which is not in the image. Should I add that to the /code directory?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml
vorto/repository/repository-server/src/main/resources/vorto-repository-config-mysql.json
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I have pre-configured the image accordingly now in this PR: eclipse/vorto#2668I'll merge it later or tomorrow

it's merged now - you can use the nightly image to get the updated container
Hello Vorto peopleI've created a Vorto infomodel and used the Ditto export plugin feature.Are there any docs how to import these .json files into Ditto?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

Jens Reimann
@ctron
Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Ok … then that would make things easier
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
@mvniekerk
Ok thanks @kolotu .
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Maintenance Announcement 22/9/2020There will be maintenance work on the main repository between 11AM-2PM CEST. The repository might be temporarily unavailable during that time frame.

@oscarfh
Hello,I am trying to run Vorto using the docker compose as explained here: https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/tree/master/docker but I am not able to log in to github
Is this documentation still up to date?
I get the following error page: Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

Harmonizing specific device payloads using Eclipse Vorto
4 min
Alexander Edelmann
你好(Chinese for “Hello”), I am based in Singapore and have been working as a software engineer for Robert Bosch since 2006. I am passionate about IoT and believe in open standards that determine the successful interplay between devices across various IoT platforms. That is why I actively contribute to the Eclipse IoT Vorto project, which aims to provide cloud-based tools to uniformly describe IoT devices and integrate them into various IoT platforms based on open IoT standards. My IoT geeky side apart, I enjoy Asian cuisines that allow me to practice my chopsticks skills. You can also find me on the court hitting a few tennis balls with my friends.
In a technical environment without a global standard, IoT device manufacturers, integrators, and platform providers are facing difficulties keeping up with the massive amounts of different payload formats, APIs, and proprietary protocols.
The open source project Eclipse Vorto addresses this problem by providing cloud-based editors to abstract vendor-specific device payloads as re-usable Vorto Function Blocks. These are then aggregated to describe a whole device in the form of a Vorto Information Model. Information Models and Function Blocks are written in vortolang, a simple grammar to define interfaces between a physical device and its digital twin counterpart. IoT solutions communicate with physical devices only via these abstract Function Blocks and their co-related data schema. In this way, IoT solutions become de-coupled from the plethora of different device data formats, APIs, and encodings. But how to convert the device data to these abstract Function Block interfaces? Simple: with so-called Vorto Mapping Specifications, which contain all the necessary instructions in order to harmonize device-specific payloads.
Payload normalization in general
Normalization of data can be handled on different system nodes, depending on the requirements of the IoT use case. This separation allows entities to keep full control over where they transform their proprietary into normalized data.
Normalization on a device node
In this scenario, the IoT device is a smart device, providing added services utilizing the onboard sensors. An example is a Bosch smart oven that provides built-in analytics on normalized data; data that could be aggregated in a cloud data lake.
Normalization on a gateway node
Normalization on an IoT platform node
Very much like in a gateway node, a cloud IoT platform normalizes incoming telemetry device data from various protocol adapters (MQTT, CoAP, etc) in order to provide value added services to northbound IoT solutions. Examples are device management or data analytics features.
Normalization on an application node
An application would normalize data in order to stay agnostic of supported devices and stay more focused on the application-specific business features, rather than implementing technical, device-specific data decoders.
Sometimes a device quite simply is not capable of carrying out payload mapping. But there are also other factors that can play a role. Think about the limitations that come with sending data to the back-end via a mobile connection. Often, you want to keep the amount of data you are transmitting to a minimum. The problem is that after mapping, the device payload is more bloated due to the normalization and conversion from binary data and similar information. To save on bandwidth, it can therefore make more sense to perform payload mapping on a different system node; on the platform for instance.
When payload mapping is not performed on the device, a different entity is needed that can execute this step. You have to use a mapping engine, which enables payloads to be transformed on either an intermediary – such as a gateway – the platform, or directly in the application.

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?

add "eclipse-vorto" tag parametrization to all "ask a question" links in .md documentation
Edge case:
the "eclipse-vorto" tag has already been created in Stack Overflow. In the _unlikely_ case that it was deleted, the links would still lead to a form containing the tag, but users with less than 1500+ reputation would not be able to post the form unless they remove the tag.

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?

Normalization of data can be handled either on a device node (1), on a gateway node (2), on an IoT platform node (3) or on an application node (4).
Tim Grossmann
As a German computer science student, I have taken on assignments in 3 different departments at Bosch over the last one and a half years. I’m particularly interested in Open Source and EduTech technologies. I believe that the IoT and automation have a huge potential to both change and improve the way people live, work, and enjoy life. A passionate learner and developer, I’m always keen to learn new skills and tooling. In addition to my regular work, I have built and now maintain the world’s largest free open-source automation bot for Instagram. In my free time, I enjoy climbing outings with friends and travel in foreign countries.
How Eclipse Vorto addresses normalization
Eclipse Vorto offers a runtime library that can be configured via a Vorto Information Model for the device. It includes a mapping specification that enriches the Information Model with device-specific payload conversion rules. In practice, the runtime library takes the device payload as an input and then outputs the converted and normalized payload, by applying the mapping specification.
The mapping specification is managed and version controlled in the Vorto Repository, alongside the Information Model for the device. This makes it possible to re-use the mapping specification for other use cases, regardless of whether the normalization takes place on the device, the gateway, the platform, or the application node. The mapping library is currently supported on the Java and Node.js platform. Read more about the Vorto Payload Mapping library.
Example: Normalizing industry data using Eclipse Vorto
In order to clarify the concepts described earlier, we will look at a specific example of how the Vorto Information Model and the mappings are used.
In our case, we send CSV data from a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to an Eclipse Hono MQTT connector.
The Vorto Payload normalization middleware consumes the data from Eclipse Hono, pipes it through the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine, and exposes the normalized device data as an AMQP topic. Any AMQP 1.0 subscriber can now retrieve harmonized device data and process it regardless of the connected device using a digital twin solution such as Bosch IoT Things.
In our example, we use Eclipse Ditto, an open source digital twin service, that receives the normalized Eclipse Vorto data and stores it. The Vorto Dashboard then requests the data from the Eclipse Ditto digital twin API and renders the data nicely using pre-defined Eclipse Vorto compliant UI widgets.
Source: Eclipse Vorto
The full conceptual setup of our device payload mapping pipeline.
If you want to see how the whole pipeline of mapping different device payloads with the Vorto Mapping Engine works, feel free to head over to the Vorto Dashboard Demo.
This article only gives a brief introduction to Payload Mappings. If you want to go through the whole process of setting up this pipeline for your own use cases, you can use our detailed tutorial to do so. It will explain how to map your custom device payloads step by step.

yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication

Ok … then that would make things easier

Not quite sure if this is what you meant, but here is a simple example on using the Vorto mapping engine with mapping rules from the vorto repository: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-vorto-converter/blob/main/src/main/java/io/drogue/iot/vorto/Converter.java

Start the dashboard
3. Once the dashboard is installed and you've created the config.json file, do a simple vorto-dashboard <PATH_TO_CONFIG.JSON> like e.g. vorto-dashboard ./config.json if it is in your current directory.
4. If everything is running correctly, you will see something like this in your Terminal:
App running on port 8080
=> Successfully pulled 5 things.
Open localhost:8080 this URL in your browser.
5. You will now be able to see your things inside of the Vorto Dashboard.
If your device isn't integrated and sending data already, check out these tutorials on how to start sending device data to the cloud.
Not displaying any data?
Reset the Bridge (Connection of the Asset Communication Package)
Switch back to the tutorial about integrating a device and double check that data is being sent.
If you see the sensor data being sent as shown in the Publish Payload:... but you still can't see any changes in the Dashboard or SwaggerUI API when retrieving the current state of the Thing, the connection between Hub and Things might have corrupted at some point.
This is simple to solve. This so called "Bridge" is created by default one subscribing to the Asset Communication.
Head over to your Subscriptions page and click on the Go to Dashboard button of your Asset Communication Subscription.
On the newly opened tab, click on the Connection tab that will display all the connections you've set up.
By default there will be a Telemetry Bosch IoT Hub connection.
Note that if there is a problem, you will see a triangle with an exclamation mark inside that indicates some failed connection.
Click on the connection and hit the Close connection button. Wait until the connection is closed.
Once the connection was closed, re-open it by clicking the Open connection button.
After the connection has been re-established, restart your sensor data sending script and observe.
What's next?

Getting Started
When working in an IoT environment we have to ensure connected devices can seamlessly communicate with cloud platforms, regardless of the different manufacturer, technologies, and systems.
In the past, developers have built IoT solutions that were specifically designed for a limited set of devices that had the same API. When changing the device type or switching device manufacturers the device integration required time-consuming refactoring to work with the new device.
Vortolang 1.0 Specification
Concepts
The Vorto project is built on four main components:
Vorto Language (DSL):
The Vorto language is a readable and easily understood domain-specific language that was specifically designed to be usable even by non-developers. It is used to create the abstract models of different devices. Read more
Metamodel:
The metamodel is used to define the relationship between the different entities like Information Models, Function Blocks, and Datatypes.
Code Generators:
Based on the DSL and metamodels, the code generators provide a sophisticated but simple way to create source code for a convenient integration of the defined IoT devices with an IoT solution platform.

Hello Vorto peopleI've created a Vorto infomodel and used the Ditto export plugin feature.Are there any docs how to import these .json files into Ditto?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?
Michael van Niekerk

Hello Vorto peopleI've created a Vorto infomodel and used the Ditto export plugin feature.Are there any docs how to import these .json files into Ditto?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?
Michael van Niekerk

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
@oscarfh
Ok, thanks a lot!

@tobias-zeptio
Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I don't have a table called modeshape_repository. :(
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
oh okay - let me check what the configuration in the container is. the repository can also be placed on the filesystem
Tobias Månsson
Vorto Repository:
The repository is used to store, manage, and distribute the created Information Models and Function Blocks for re-use.
For a more in depth introduction into the concepts, feel free to read the blog post about Eclipse Vorto.
Learning Path
Understanding the Vorto Language
Create and Manage your namespaces to get ready for describing devices.
Describe your first device in 5 minutes using the Vorto Web Editor
You can also describe new devices using the Vorto Eclipse IDE
Provision your device to create a new digital twin inside Bosch IoT Things - (9min video)
Integrate your device using Python / Java / Arduino - (10min video)
Visualize your sensor data using the Vorto Dashboard - (7min video)
You can also use the Bosch IoT Things SwaggerUI to validate your data if you're using the Bosch IoT Suite.
If you want to see the full process of creating, integrating and visualizing sensor data for a new device, feel free to watch the webcast IoT Demo Day Part I: Vorto for Asset Communication Package (33min).
A Webinar with an introduction into Vorto and a simple use case can be watched here Webinar: Semantic Modelling in Action - Eclipse Vorto (55min).

Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I have to run, but I see run.py is referencing a application.yml which is not in the image. Should I add that to the /code directory?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml
vorto/repository/repository-server/src/main/resources/vorto-repository-config-mysql.json
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB

I have pre-configured the image accordingly now in this PR: eclipse/vorto#2668I'll merge it later or tomorrow

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok thanks @kolotu .
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

@ctron
Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Ok … then that would make things easier

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Ok … then that would make things easier

you can use our mail template to request the official namespace - you can find it on the 'Manage' tab on the UI

Eclipse Vorto: The next step in IoT device integration
6 min
Alexander Edelmann
你好(Chinese for “Hello”), I am based in Singapore and have been working as a software engineer for Robert Bosch since 2006. I am passionate about IoT and believe in open standards that determine the successful interplay between devices across various IoT platforms. That is why I actively contribute to the Eclipse IoT Vorto project, which aims to provide cloud-based tools to uniformly describe IoT devices and integrate them into various IoT platforms based on open IoT standards. My IoT geeky side apart, I enjoy Asian cuisines that allow me to practice my chopsticks skills. You can also find me on the court hitting a few tennis balls with my friends.
Looking at examples like smart factories and homes, connected devices are improving not only the cost and resource efficiency of companies but are also increasing the safety and convenience of living. With the sheer number of device and sensor manufacturers, new challenges are surfacing for the manufacturers, platforms, and integrators.
The main problem is how to ensure connected devices can seamlessly communicate with cloud platforms, regardless of the different manufacturers, technologies, and systems. In the past, developers have built IoT solutions that were specifically designed for a limited set of devices that had the same API. When changing the device type or switching device manufacturers the device integration required time-consuming refactoring to work with the new device.
Imagine you plan to integrate an IoT solution for asset tracking on a large crop farm. You not only want to keep track of the current location but also temperature and acceleration of the tractors, plows, and other agricultural devices.
Two questions surface when thinking about choosing the right IoT devices:
How can we avoid tight coupling between specific devices so it is easier to switch to a similar device without too much refactoring?
This is where the open source Eclipse Vorto steps in.
Introducing Eclipse Vorto
Source: Eclipse Vorto
The Eclipse Vorto project is built on four main components:
Vorto DSL: The Vorto DSL is a readable and easily understood domain-specific language that was specifically designed to be usable even by non-developers. It is used to create the abstract models of different devices.
Metamodel: The metamodel is used to define the relationship between the different entities like Information Models, Function Blocks, and Datatypes.
Code Generators: Based on the DSL and metamodels, the code generators provide a sophisticated but simple way to create source code for a convenient integration of the defined IoT devices with an IoT solution platform.

Vorto Repository: The repository is used to store, manage, and distribute the created Information Models and Function Blocks for re-use.
Eclipse Vorto is fully open source and developed within the Eclipse IoT Working Group under the stewardship of Bosch.
Tim Grossmann
As a German computer science student, I have taken on assignments in 3 different departments at Bosch over the last one and a half years. I’m particularly interested in Open Source and EduTech technologies. I believe that the IoT and automation have a huge potential to both change and improve the way people live, work, and enjoy life. A passionate learner and developer, I’m always keen to learn new skills and tooling. In addition to my regular work, I have built and now maintain the world’s largest free open-source automation bot for Instagram. In my free time, I enjoy climbing outings with friends and travel in foreign countries.
Eclipse Vorto in practice
Let’s look at a more specific example to understand this abstraction better. Imagine an agriculture business that wants to keep track of the vehicles and assets used to collect the wheat crops. On larger farms with several harvesters, tractors, and other assets, we want to know the amount of time each vehicle was used and its location history.
When combining this kind of information with temperature and humidity values, we can enable a smart maintenance plan for all the vehicles and assets. The location of each vehicle and asset also provides us with anti-theft capabilities.
Source: Bosch.IO
In order to create a digital model of this specific device, we need to have some basic building blocks which will be used to assemble the TRACI Information Model.
One of the most important components of the tracking device is the battery. To be able to monitor the battery state of each device we can describe the state in what is called, a Function Block.
A Function Block is a generic model that can be reused later on in other device Information Models.
We can define one like this:
namespace org.eclipse.vorto
version 1.0.0
displayname "Battery"
description "Functionblock for Battery"
category peripheral
using org.eclipse.vorto.Voltage ; 1.0.0
Creator and ModifiedBy user ID not anonymized correctly, when user account is deleted #1976
Inheritance not resolved completely during Code Generation #1954
0.12
This version primarily focuses on stability, performance as well as UX.
New Features
Vorto Repository Features
Content - Assist / Auto-completion in Web Editors when writing vortolang models
Backup & Restore of all models per namespace
REST API Endpoint to allow the import of Vorto Models (or 3rd party models) in the Repository
Device Integration Features
Support for nested entities inside Function Blocks in the Payload Mapping Engine (Java only). Please take note of the compatibility section.
Supported Payload Mapping Target Platform format: AWS IoT Shadow and Eclipse Ditto Protocol
Support of operation return types in OpenAPI Generator
Compatibility
With this release, the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine now supports the mapping to nested entities, declared in Function Blocks. This change required us to completely modify the Mapping Specification JSON runtime model, which is required by the Mapping Engine at configuration time. The old mapping specification runtime-model is no longer supported. Therefore, make sure to download the new Mapping Specification from the Vorto Repository and deploy it in your system, if you upgrade to this new version! This change does not break any previous design time mapping models!

Decouple IoT solutions from connected device data
In a technical environment without a global standard, IoT device manufacturers, integrators, and platform providers are facing difficulties keeping up with the massive amounts of different payload formats, APIs, and proprietary protocols.
The open source project Eclipse Vorto addresses this problem by providing cloud-based editors to abstract vendor-specific device payloads as re-usable Vorto Function Blocks. These are then aggregated to describe a whole device in the form of a Vorto Information Model. Information Models and Function Blocks are written in vortolang, a simple grammar to define interfaces between a physical device and its digital twin counterpart. IoT solutions communicate with physical devices only via these abstract Function Blocks and their co-related data schema. In this way, IoT solutions become de-coupled from the plethora of different device data formats, APIs, and encodings. But how to convert the device data to these abstract Function Block interfaces? Simple: with so-called Vorto Mapping Specifications, which contain all the necessary instructions in order to harmonize device-specific payloads.
In this tutorial, we are going to work ourselves throught the process of connecting various geolocation sensors to the cloud and consume their data in a simple cloud application. One of the challenges faced in IoT is that vendors use their own payload formats. JSON and CSV are two examples of payload formats. Vorto Mapping Specifications together with Normalisation Middleware is a mechanism we will use to normalise the various payload formats. Once this has been done, our application will be able to consume data originating from any geolocation sensor vendor. To achieve this, a Vorto Mapping specification must first be written for each expected payload format.
Steps to take
Create a small IoT application that receives geolocation data and prints it out in the console
Test the app by sending data via MQTT in different payload representations
Applying Vorto, to normalize the geolocation data. This would reduce the complexity in our app and only deal with a single geolocation representation, regardless of the connected sensors.
Pre-requisites
The Eclipse IoT stack offers a very nice device connectivity service, called Eclipse Hono, comprising many different protocol adapters. One of them is MQTT, exactly what we need in our solution to connect our sensors. To save us some time of setting up the service on our own, we use a free plan of an cloud operated Eclipse Hono service, provided by Bosch.
Here is a list of things that you need to work through this tutorial:
Bosch ID Account
Subscribe to Bosch IoT Hub (Free plan) for MQTT connectivity based on Eclipse Hono
Amazon MQ cloud service for AMQP messaging
Java 8 or higher
Maven
Docker Runtime
Mosquitto_pub Client tool
Some IDE (e.g. Eclipse)

status {
mandatory remainingCapacity as float <MIN 0, MAX 100>
}
}
Here we describe a Function Block that abstractly describes some entity that contains a mandatory numerical value between 0 and 100.
Since our status is a percentage value, we can further abstract this to, again, make the distinct components reusable. Therefore, we will create what is called a Datatype. Here we can define an entity (Percentage in this case) that has the same restrictions of being a numerical value between 0 and 100.
namespace org.eclipse.vorto.types
version 1.0.0
displayname "Percentage"
description "Datatype for Percentage"
category units
entity Percentage {
mandatory value as float <MIN 0, MAX 100>
}
Once we created this Datatype, it can be imported and used inside our Battery Function Block and replaces the concrete implementation.

0.11
With the release of Eclipse Vorto 0.11, we are introducing essential improvements that guarantee you full control over your models and their release process.
Fine-grained Role Management allows your team to restrict access to certain features like the creation of models, releasing it to the public, and deprecating them.
Models, by default, are created in private namespaces for which the access can be controlled in detail using the newly introduced roles.
In addition to the new, state-of-the-art, Eclipse Vorto Repository, we released the official 1.0 version of the Vortolang, the DSL powering the Vorto Ecosystem.
Due to these substantial changes, we've decided that automatically migrating all existing models to the new system is the improper approach and therefore provided straight-forward exporters and importers that will allow you to effortlessly migrate your models of choice from the old system.
Enhancements in all areas are complemented with new and extensive documentation for not only new features and improvements but also convenient plugins that have easily been missed in the past.
All in all, this release addresses, tackles, and simplifies many key pain points for people working with and in IoT and delivers some of the most important improvements to Eclipse Vorto ever.
Follow our comprehensive guide on how to migrate your models to the new system.
New Features
Please refer to our Getting started guide for details.

I have to run, but I see run.py is referencing a application.yml which is not in the image. Should I add that to the /code directory?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml
vorto/repository/repository-server/src/main/resources/vorto-repository-config-mysql.json
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I have pre-configured the image accordingly now in this PR: eclipse/vorto#2668I'll merge it later or tomorrow
In this step, we create a tiny IoT solution that receives the sensor data and simply prints the data out to the console. But how do we get the data from Eclipse Hono? It's easy. Hono provides an AMQP endpoint that makes it possible for applications to receive telemetry data. Hono does not make any assumption how the payload looks like and merely forwards the data "as is" to the AMQP endpoint. Our application receives the data and does something useful with it. Well, in this case just prints it out to the console.
To save us some time at this point, we have already created the application for you. Download and then import it into your IDE
Open the src/main/resources/application.yml and configure the tenantId, username and password.
Where to find these values ? Login to Bosch IoT Suite Portal with your Bosch ID and click on Credentials.
Run the app with mvn spring-boot:run. You should not see any data coming in just yet. But we can change that quickly by sending some geolocation data to the MQTT endpoint.
Step 2: Sending geolocation data to Bosch IoT Hub using MQTT protocol
First let's register a device in the device registry under a specific device-id. Only then we can send data for that device-id to the Bosch IoT Hub.
Register devices
We can easily register our sample devices via the Device Registry Swagger UI
In order to use the API, you need to login via username and password. Therefore click on Authorize, and use the Bosch IoT Suite Portal again, to find the username and password values at the bottom of the Credentials page.
Register 2 devices 4711 and 4712 using the Device Registry Swagger UI. The following example shows the device registration for device with ID 4711:
{
"enabled": true,
"device-id": "4711"
}
Repeat the step for the second device.
Add device credentials for these 2 devices using the Credentials Swagger UI. The following example shows the credentials registration for a device with the ID 4711:
{
"device-id": "4711",
"type": "hashed-password",
"auth-id": "4711",

We can repeat this process for all the sensors integrated into our TRACI device like the temperature sensor, GPS, acceleration, and connectivity modules. All those Function Blocks can then be assembled in a Vorto Information Model which can then be used as the starting point for the code generators to produce device integration code stubs for you.

Device Integration Features
Payload Mapping Engine (Java and node.js), that lets you convert arbitrary (device) data to normalized Vorto-compliant data structure, fast and reliably.
Bosch IoT Suite Generator add-on: Generates a script to provision devices in the Bosch IoT Suite from Vorto models
OpenAPI / Swagger Generator, which generates a device-specific REST - API specification for Digital Twin services, such as Bosch IoT Things.
JSON - Schema Generator, which creates JSON-Schema files from Vorto models
Developer SDK Features
Plugin SDK Version 2, to build and run serverless Vorto generator- and importer plugins. The SDK provides utilities and many source code examples
Deprecation
Plugin SDK Version 1 is marked as deprecated in this release. However it is still supported to implement and run generator plugins based on Version 1.0. However we are recommending to migrate them to Plugin Version 2, as it is much easier and faster.

Repeat this step for the second device.
Publish data via MQTT
Download the Hub Server certificate curl -o iothub.crt https://docs.bosch-iot-hub.com/cert/iothub.crt
Use the mosquitto_pub client to send some geolocation data:
Verify the incoming data in our IoT application from step 1.
You should now see the data being printed out to the console in something like:
Send some data for our second device 4712. This time change the payload message representation to CSV style. Example:
You should now also see the data of our second device in the console of our application.
You can already see from here, that our application would now need to be made aware of handling these two different ways of payload representations. This means writing additional custom code. No worries, let Eclipse Vorto take care of this.
Let us walk you through the process in the next step.
Step 3: De-coupling application from connected sensors
In this step, we are going to use Eclipse Vorto in order to de-couple our application from the connected sensors. This has the following benefits:
Reduced complexity and therefore development efforts in our IoT application. Our app can fully focus on processing one single data format, rather than many formats of different devices types.
1. Specifying the Geolocation interface with Vorto
As in traditional Software Design, we need to first think about the interfaces of the system as well as the data structures that are exchanged between devices and the IoT solution. Vorto provides a web-based tooling, that let's you easily define interfaces, so called Function Blocks. In our case, we are going to create a Geolocation Function Block:

Alright, so what do we do all this for?
Let’s say we now want to use devices from other manufacturers with similar features to the TRACI device. We’ve already created an IoT solution that integrated the TRACI device and it would be a huge pain to refactor our system to work with devices from different manufacturers.
Since we already have our Function Blocks and the Datatypes defined, we can define a new Information Model for our new device that uses the same Function Blocks as the TRACI model.

Developer SDK Features
Generator Plugin SDK, which allows to build and deploy Vorto Generator-plugins as standalone (micro)services and hook them into the Vorto repository.
Deprecation
The Eclipse Vorto IoT Toolset Plugins are no longer supported. Instead you can simply use the Cloud-based Editors in the Vorto Repository.
Changes in the Java Repository Client: The client has a new simplified org.eclipse.vorto.repository.client.IRepositoryClient in order to read Vorto Models.
Login to the Vorto Repository with your Bosch ID or Github ID account.
In order to start creating models, you need to first create your own namespace. Skip this step, if you already own a namespace
Click Explore in the menu and then click Create Model
Add the following status properties for the Geolocation and hit Save:
vortolang 1.0
namespace vorto.private.aedelmann // namespace can be different in your case
version 1.0.0
status {
mandatory longitude as float "location longitude coordinate"
mandatory latitude as float "location latitude coordinate"
optional altitude as float "location altitude coordinate"
}
}
2. Describing device implementing Geolocation interface
In this step, we will create an Information Model that implements the Geolocation Function Block. An Information Model represents a vendor - specific device.
Click Explore in the menu and then click Create Model
This time choose Information Model and work yourself through the wizard by giving it the name SensorOne and version 1.0.0.
In the popup Click Next and confirm with Create. This will take you directly to the newly created Information Model
vortolang 1.0
namespace vorto.private.aedelmann // namespace can be different in your case, depending on your owning namespace

Who should use Eclipse Vorto?
Given the diversity of entities involved in manufacturing, integration, and development of IoT solutions, the entities that will benefit most from Eclipse Vorto are:
Device manufacturers
Eclipse Vorto can help device manufacturers enable interoperability with other devices in existing infrastructures. Flexibility is a huge advantage to customers when choosing devices that are to be integrated.
By using technology independent Information Models, device manufacturers avoid the overhead of generating ways of implementations for all kind of target platforms. This saves money and time by publishing Information Models that can be converted into concrete integrations using the code generators.
The big advantage of using Eclipse Vorto is that further evolutions of the device protocol layer are decoupled from the device controller logic.

3. Mapping device payload to Geolocation interface
Previously, we saw that both sensor types were sending data in different payload representations, JSON as well as CSV. Our solution ordinarily would need to parse these different payloads and somehow identify the semantics behind this payload.
In this step, we are going to map the JSON and CSV to the Geolocation Function Block. Vorto Mappings are a very nice way to do this, and pretty easy to boot.
Here is how its' done:
Click Explore and open the details of the SensorOne Information Model
Click Create Mapping which opens a dialog with some background information about mappings. Confirm with Create. This will open the Payload Mapping Editor
You will see two tabs, each for every Function Block property. Select deviceInformation tab
Our sensor does not really transmit any device information meta data. That's why we hard code these values here. Under manufacturer add "ACME Company". Make sure to add quote marks at the beginning and end of the provided manufacterer string.
Open location mapping tab. Let's map the longitude and latitude to the Function Block.
For longitude add number:toFloat(/longitude) and for latitude add number:toFloat(/latitude)

IoT platforms
IoT platforms have to connect a vast variety of different IoT devices from a wide range of manufacturers and support all the different protocols and formats. By using Eclipse Vorto’s code generators, this effort can be reduced drastically through either partial or full source code generation.
In addition, the Vorto Repository acts as a runtime repository which allows platforms to retrieve device capabilities as JSON schema. These schemas can then be interpreted and validated in the digital twin or used to bootstrap connectors for the communication.
Even though this means increased initial development work, it will pay off over time considering the vast amount of devices and the growth of IoT.
Solution developers
When integrating connected devices and smart sensors into IoT solutions, developers need to cover a wide range of different device APIs which results in a huge coding overhead. Eclipse Vorto can reduce the amount of development work involved by providing code generators that provide generic code stubs that simplify the integration of devices.
Source: Eclipse Vorto
Glancing into the future of the IoT
By guaranteeing interoperability and harmonizing the interface for devices, Eclipse Vorto has the potential to change the way device manufacturers, IoT platform operators and application developers work with IoT devices.
It can reduce the development work for manufacturers and ease the device integration for platform providers and integrators while tackling many of the mentioned challenges of IoT development.
If you want to learn more about the project, make sure to check out the GitHub repository and give it a star.

Minor Repository UI/UX Improvements
0.10.0 milestone 4
Fixes and Enhancements
We can now test the entire mapping by inserting a sample JSON in the input box on the right and hit Map:
{
"longitude" : "103.2",
"latitude" : "23.2"
}
You should be able to see the following mapped output:
{
"deviceInformation": {
"status": {
"manufacturer": "ACME Company"
}
},
"location": {
"status": {
"latitude": 23.2,
"longitude": 103.2
}
}
}
Fantastic! You have just created a mapping for one sensor that sends its payload as JSON.
Create a mapping spec for your SensorTwo Information Model:
This time for manufacturer, set the value "Company XYZ"
The second sensor sends its geolocation payload as CSV. Therefore, add the following mapping for the longitude number:toFloat(array[1]) and for latitude number:toFloat(array[2]).
Save and download the mapping spec as well.
This completes the Vorto Modelling. In summary, we described two sensor types as Vorto Information Models, implementing the same Geolocation Function Block. We then created payload mappings for each of them, in order to map their specific payload to the same semantic Function Block definition.

EU-GDPR Compliance of Vorto Repository, i.e. Export of user-specific Vorto models.
Eclipse Hono Generator, supporting the generation of Arduino-, Python- and Java source code.
Code Generator Configuration UI. Code Generators that are executed from the Eclipse Vorto Toolset do now provide a configuration UI that allows developers to customize the execution of the generator.
API Changes
Vorto Code Generators must now implement org.eclipse.vorto.codegen.api.IVortoCodeGenerator.getInfo() that give more meta information about the specific Code Generator. This information is used by Vorto to provide a Generator Configuration UI automatically.
The Vorto Repository REST - API for publishing models is now secured exclusively with OAuth2 token - based authentication.
It is now only possibly to publish models to the Vorto Repository via the Vorto Repository Web UI !
0.10.0 milestone 2
Fixes and Enhancements
Vorto Mapping library that is able to convert arbitrary device payload to specific IoT platform format, e.g. to Eclipse Ditto.
More code generators, that generate device code that integrates with Eclipse Hono via MQTT.
Many bugfixes
In the next step, we are going to see these Vorto models and mappings in action.
4. Setting up Eclipse Vorto Payload Normalization Middleware with Vorto AMQP Plugin
As seen in the picture, we will now setup the Eclipse Vorto Payload Normalization Middleware, which is a micro service written in Java, that consumes data from Eclipse Hono via AMQP and converts the data to semantic data structures, defined as Vorto Function Blocks. For this, the middleware utilizes the Mapping Specification that we created in the previous step.
Now for the normalized data to be consumed by our IoT application we will send the normalized data from middleware to Amazon MQ and in the next step configure the IoT application to receive data from the new endpoint.
Create an Amazon MQ Broker using the tutorial from AWS here.
Now start the middleware using the Eclipse Vorto AMQP plugin and mounting a mappings folder which contains your sensor mapping specifications. We will configure our IoT Solution to subscribe to the new AMQP endpoint in the next step.
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v c:/absolute_local_dir:/mappings -e mapping_spec_dir=/mappings -e github.client.clientId=your_github_clientid -e github.client.clientSecret=your_github_clientsecret -e hono.tenantId=your_tenantId -e hono.password=your_hono_password -e amqp.url=OpenWire_endpoint -e amqp.topic.vorto=telemetry/vorto -e amqp.username=myusername -e amqp.password=mypassword eclipsevorto/vorto-normalizer:nightly
Before we can start sending data via MQTT again, we need to make some changes to the Bosch IoT Hub Device Registry. These changes are required by the Vorto middleware to work properly.
Open the Device Registry Swagger UI
Find the PUT Command , which updates your existing device ID. Add the following JSON content:
{
"enabled": true,
"device-id": "4711",
"defaults" : {
"vorto" : "<your_namespace>:SensorOne:1.0.0",
"content-type" : "application/json"
}
}
This basically overwrites the default configuration for this device ID by specifying the Vorto Information Model (device type) for the registered device as well as in what content-type the device sends its data.
Repeat this step for the second device ID (4712) , with the following content:
{
"enabled": true,
"device-id": "4712",

Readme.md
Eclipse Vorto provides a language for describing models and interfaces for IoT Digital Twins. Digital twins are models of entities in the physical world such as a (multi) sensor device, smart power plant, and other entities that participate in IoT solutions. Modeling enables IoT solutions and IoT platforms to provision, use, and configure IoT devices and logical entities from multiple sources in a single solution. Using the vortolang and describing the entities's capabilities, IoT platforms and IoT solutions can leverage the semantics of these IoT entities.

0.10.0 milestone 1
We are proud to announce Eclipse Vorto 0.10.0 milestone 1.
Here are a few major highlights:
More Code Generators have been added to the list of existing generators.
Repository Java client API
Many bug fixes and improvements
Web Editor
With the Web Editor, users can describe devices online and publish these as information models to the Vorto Repository.
Code Generators
We have a few new Code Generators for easier device integration. Those are
Alexa Skill-set Generator for Bosch IoT Suite
Device Simulator Generator for Bosch IoT Suite
Eclipse Kura Generator
Web-based UI Dashboard Generator
Alexa Skill-set & Device Simulator for Bosch IoT Suite Generators
The Device Simulator Generator for Bosch IoT Suite generates a simulator that creates test data for a given information model and publishes the data to the Bosch IoT Suite.
Eclipse Kura Generator
Eclipse Kura generator supports the generation of a Kura gateway OSGI bundle that reads device data via bluetooth LE technology and sends the data to either Kura built-in Cloud Services or the Bosch IoT Suite.
Web-based Device Dashboard Generator
The Web - based Device Dashboard generator creates a Spring Boot Web application that is able to visualise the device data with various UI components as well as consume the data from a IoT Cloud backend, e.g. Bosch IoT Suite.
Repository Java Client
"defaults" : {
"vorto" : "<your_namespace>:SensorTwo:1.0.0",
"content-type" : "text/csv"
}
}
Finally! We are all set to start sending the same data as in step 2 using mosquitto_pub. You should be able to see the normalized payload with the exact same structure for both sensor types in the Vorto Middleware monitoring logs.
5. Make IoT application changes
Change the configuration of the Geolocation IoT application, by pointing it to our new Amazon MQ Broker AMQP endpoint, in order to receive the normalized geolocation sensor data.
Please open the application.yml and replace the url, topic and credentials as seen below:
amqp:
username: TECHNICAL_USER_AMAZON_MQ_TO_PUBLISH
password: TECHNICAL_USER_AMAZON_MQ_PASSWORD
queue: telemetry/vorto
When you start the application and send data for the two sensors via MQTT, you will see the normalized geolocation data printed in the console of the application.
What's next?
Integrate with AWS Kinesis for realtime data analytics
Extend the solution with a digital twin service

@kolotu
Hi @oscarfh yes the documentation is still up to date - I just tried it and was not able to reproduce your issue. Could you please double check your configuration - especially your Github client ID and client secret?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
Hi @kolotu, thanks for your reply.
I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet
# Repository
DATASOURCE=mysql
AUTH_PROVIDER=github
ADMIN_USER=oscarfh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
EIDP_CLIENT_ID=
EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

Information Model Repository
Generator API
Vorto Code Generators convert an Information Model into executable IoT platform specific source code. The Generator API lets you plug in your own code generator into the toolset. Toolset wizards help you through this process.
Code Generators
In order to inspire you to build you own generator for your platform, we implemented many Code Generators, for example Bosch IoT Things, AWS, ThingWorx and many more. They illustrate the many possibilities of how code generators can be effectively used and act as a blueprint for other generator implementations.
Command Line Interface (CLI)
A Command Line Interface Tool lets you explore information models, checkin new information models as well as generate code for a selected IoT platform.

@kolotu I found out: I am using a VPN for access, which reduces strongly my internet speed. It seems that it is timing out (works perfectly if I unplug the VPN). Is there any way for me to change the timeout period?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

IMO it would be even better to use the Maven License Plugin. This plugin can fail your local build, in case the license headers are not correct. The plugin was already integrated, but the configuration was incorrect, therefore it was never executed.
I've re-configured it and updated all files to contain the proper header with 2020 as year.

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.
Tobias Månsson

I have to run, but I see run.py is referencing a application.yml which is not in the image. Should I add that to the /code directory?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml
vorto/repository/repository-server/src/main/resources/vorto-repository-config-mysql.json
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I have pre-configured the image accordingly now in this PR: eclipse/vorto#2668I'll merge it later or tomorrow
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
it's merged now - you can use the nightly image to get the updated container

Thanks, that works. :)

@ctron
Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Ok … then that would make things easier
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
you can use our mail template to request the official namespace - you can find it on the 'Manage' tab on the UI
Jens Reimann
Yes
Something went wrong, but don’t fret — let’s give it another shot.

Thanks for the quick answer
helenzhang2019lei
@helenzhang2019lei
hello, is there any mapping spec example in vorto repository that defined the mapping rules can be used by the payload mapping engine?
helenzhang2019lei
@helenzhang2019lei
any project in git?
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Not quite sure if this is what you meant, but here is a simple example on using the Vorto mapping engine with mapping rules from the vorto repository: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-vorto-converter/blob/main/src/main/java/io/drogue/iot/vorto/Converter.java
Alexander Edelmann
@aedelmann
U can take a look at the running mapping middleware for 3 examples
http://vorto-middleware.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/#/plugins
helenzhang2019lei
@helenzhang2019lei

helenzhang2019lei

Updated middleware overview to add AWS Kinesis

Vorto Examples
This repository contains example code that have been implemented using the Eclipse Vorto SDK.
Vorto Web Dashboard
Node.js/React based web dashboard, that displays device data, which are modelled with Vorto. Read more
Eclipse Vorto Semantic Middleware
The Eclipse Vorto Semantic Middleware is a small and light-weight microservice that is able to convert any device telemetry payload (binary, json, xml, ...) to semantic Vorto compliant data structures and exposes the data via AMQP or push it to AWS Kinesis. Other micro services can easily consume the data to further process it, e.g. for running analytics on the data.
The middleware provides an Integration API, where data processors can be plugged in, such as integrating the "harmonized data" with any 3rd party IoT data service.

Vorto Generator Plugins
Vorto Generators convert Vorto Models to any platform specific source code. This code can be a simple platform descriptor, device , or backend code. They are stateless in nature and can be easily developed using the Vorto Plugin SDK.
Checkout other Example Generators
Vorto Importer Plugins
Vorto Importers convert 3rd party platform descriptions to Vorto models. Just as Generator plugins, they are stateless and can easily be developed using the Vorto Plugin SDK.
To get started, checkout the LwM2M example, that converts LwM2M/IPSO XML descriptions to Vorto Function Block - and Mapping models. This example is deployed as a AWS Lambda service.

I am expecting an attribute values of type array to be created.

The multiple keyword is ignored and an object of type number instead of an array is generated.

See my vorto-ditto-skeleton-generator project for reference how I'm using the generator as micro-service in a docker-container.
What is wrong?
The generator does not always traverse through the extends dependencies and return all of the configuration and status properties. This might be a bug or a flaw in my template.

Eclipse Vorto Device Dashboard
React and NodeJS based Dashboard that helps quickly prototype IoT Device integrations with the Bosch IoT Suite.
Integrated IoT devices can be displayed and data visualized.
The Dashboard uses the Eclipse Vorto project to unify the definition of device capabilities and provides out-of-the-box visualization widgets that display sensor data in a visually appealing way.
Installation
Installing the dashboard is as easy as doing
npm install -g vorto-dashboard
Note that we are installing it as a global dependency which will allow you to call vorto-dashboard from your command line
You can provide your OAuth2 credentials through environment variables.
The three environment variables you have to provide are:
BOSCH_CLIENT_IDBOSCH_CLIENT_SECRETBOSCH_SCOPEREACT_APP_DEVICE_REFRESH_MS
The REACT_APP_DEVICE_REFRESH_MS variable defines the interval in which the dashboard is updating the state of the listed devices
Alternatively you can provide a configuration file to the vorto-dashboard call.

vorto-dashboard config.json
This has to be in the format of:
In addition to that you can set the port the dashboard should run on by using the PORT environment variable.
The LOG_LEVEL env var can be used to change the logging level. By default this is error.
The Simulator has two additional env variables.
TIME_TO_LIVE defines the amount of seconds the simulator should run in total.
TIME_INTERVAL_TELEMETRY defines the amount of seconds between the sending of data points.
Setup Things
When integrating devices, pleace consult the following resources:
Vorto Dashboard Tutorial
Vorto Video Walkthrough
Developing the Vorto Dashboard
If you want to extend and modify the source code of the Vorto Dashboard project you need to work on a local setup of the project.
Installation
cd vorto_dashboardnpm install# start the react dashboardnpm start# start the "backend"node index.js <PATH_TO_CONFIG.JSON>
Extending the Dashboard with custom Cards
Creating a Topology
In order to create a topology that can be displayed in the Sidebar, we need to follow a defined structure.
In addition to all your devices, you have to create at least one meta-thing that defines the root of the topology.
You can use the basic structre of a thing and define the attributes like this:
Note That the "definition": "org.eclipse.vorto:Topology:1.0.0" is the most important part since it defines this element as the root.
In order to add containers that hold entities, simply create another meta-model that holds similar content to the root (e.g. empyt features etc.).
Make sure to define the references and referencedBy fields in the attributes in order to tell the dashboard the structure.

Getting started with Vorto Mappings
Vorto abstracts device data using Function Blocks, thus helping to reduce tight-coupling of devices in IoT solutions.
But how does Vorto help to map the actual device data to these abstract Function Blocks?
Payloads sent in different formats from the devices can be piped through the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine which will use the Mapping Specification and the provided Converters.
The advantage of using this approach is that target platforms do not have to care about the different payloads of the devices but only need to handle the normalized Vorto compliant payloads.
This normalized format can then be used as a harmonized starting point for more specific, target platform compliant formats.
In addition to that, custom Converters can be easily plugged into the Payload Mapping Engine in order to allow for more complex conversion of proprietary payloads.
In this tutorial, we are going to walk you through the process of creating a Vorto mapping specification for an Information Model and execute it with the Vorto Payload Mapping Engine.
Prerequisite
To work through this tutorial, you will need:
BoschID or GitHub account to log in to the Vorto Repository
You have described a device as a Vorto Information Model and it is managed in the Vorto Repository
You are a collaborator/owner of a namespace
Performance
The Vorto mapping-engine has been load-tested regarding performance and speed according to different mapping scenarios. A report and detailed description can be found here.
Step 1: Create Mapping Specification
A mapping adds platform specific information to an Information Model. Since the representation of data can vary from platform to platform.
To create a mapping go to your newly created model and press the Create Mapping Spec. Button
Once you have written your xpath expressions, press Save.

I'm still having this issue.
I tested the ditto schema generator on a vorto 0.12.4 instance and build the schema generator with the plugin api v0.12.4. The multiple -> array branches of the code won't get executed still.

namespace org.eclipse.vorto
version 1.0.0

The resulting schema is this

Publishing a new release
Once changes have been merged into master and a new release tag has been created, an automated travis-ci job will be triggered that publishes the new version to NPM.
Triggering a new release is done by pushing a new tag to master.

Step 2: Test the Mapping Specification
On the right handside, select "JSON' as content type and paste the device raw data in the JSON editor. Test your mapping rule by clicking Test Mapping:
The test result will give you the mapped data for different IoT platforms.
The Vorto (canonical) format looks like:
The AWS IoT Shadow update command format looks like:
The Eclipse Ditto update command format looks like:
Step 3: Download & Execute Mapping Specification
Download and save the Mapping Specification to start integrating it with the engine:
1. Add Maven dependency
<dependency>
<groupId>org.eclipse.vorto</groupId>
<artifactId>mapping-engine-all</artifactId>
<version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
2. Initialize the mapping engine with the downloaded specification
MappingEngine engine = MappingEngine.createFromInputStream(FileUtils.openInputStream(new File("src/main/resources/mappingspec.json")));
3. Pass the arbitrary device payload to the engine to get it converted to Vorto compliant data
Object deviceData = ...;
InfomodelValue mappedData = engine.map(deviceData);
4. Optionally validate the mapped data to check if it complies to the Vorto model
ValidationReport validationReport = mappedData.validate();
if (!validationReport.isValid()) {
// handle invalid data
}

There are quite a few exceptions in production logs due to:
Session invalid
User does not have permissions to access a model
Invalid characters used in search
Actual: ERROR is thrown
Expected: Handle these exceptions gracefully with an INFO message. Identify if there are more such exceptions which do not need to be thrown as an ERROR.

Introduction
This document specifies the Vorto Language (vortolang 1.0), a language for describing models and interfaces for IoT Digital Twins. Digital twins are models of entities in the physical world such as a (multi) sensor device, smart power plant, and other entities that participate in IoT solutions. Modeling enables IoT solutions and IoT platforms to provision, use, and configure IoT devices and logical entities from multiple sources in a single solution. Using the vortolang and describing the entities's capabilities, IoT platforms and IoT solutions can leverage the semantics of these IoT entities.
Digital Twin Vorto Language
Digital twins are described using the vortolang, which is domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL underlies a very simple grammar, making it very easy to describe digital twin models. In order to be used in IoT Platforms and solutions, the vortolang can easily be converted into well adopted languages, such as JSON-LD, where additional context-specific attributes can be added. Many (free) libraries are available to process these language files. At definition time, developers can use the vortolang without any knowledge about JSON-LD or others, and fully focus on describing the device capabilities in a very expressive way.
The vortolang is made up of a set of metamodel classes (described later in more detail) that define the capabilities of digital twins. There are two top-level classes, Information Model and Function Block, that describe a digital twin and the capabilities of digital twins, respectively. There are three metamodel classes that describe capabilities: Properties, Events, and Operations.
When writing a digital twin definition, it's necessary to specify the version of the vortolang being used (currently 1.0)
Information Models and Function Blocks
There are two top-level metamodel classes: Information Model and Function Block. Information Models describe a complete digital twin, such as a physical device. Often, Information Models are associated with a specific device product, such as a "Bosch Dinion IP Starlight 8000MP" security camera, while Function Blocks describe the related capabilities of an digital twin (its status- and configuration properties, events, and operations). Function Blocks can be reused across different Information Models. Information Models are often made up of multiple Function Blocks (interfaces).
Information Model
An Information Model describes a complete digital twin, such as a physical device and defines the set of interfaces as Function Blocks, implemented by the digital twin.

This is a small add-on related to the migration guide for 0.13 (see mainly #2159).
On top of what they are already doing (creating required columns and setting up default values) the scripts should also clean up columns that might have been previously created in error, such as "authentication_provider" (we are using "authentication_provider_id" now).

BooleanPropertyAttribute and EnumLiteralPropertyAttribute are existing in the vortolang 1.0, but are not yet included in the Swagger specification. They should be placed under schemas / ModelProperty / attributes.

5. Convert mapped data to Digital Twin IoT compliant data
Convert the normalized Vorto compliant data to a target IoT platform format.
Currently supported target IoT Platform formats
AWS IoT Shadow Service
Eclipse Ditto Service
The following example shows how to convert the normalized data to AWS IoT Shadow Update Command:
import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
import org.eclipse.vorto.mapping.targetplatform.awsiot.TwinPayloadFactory;
...
JSONObject updateRequestAWSIoT = TwinPayloadFactory.toShadowUpdateRequest(mappedData);
sendToAWSIoTShadow(updateRequestAWSIoT,"com.acme:4711");
The following example shows how to convert the normalized data to Eclipse Ditto Update Command:
import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
import org.eclipse.vorto.mapping.targetplatform.ditto.TwinPayloadFactory;
...
JSONObject updateRequestDitto = TwinPayloadFactory.toDittoProtocol(mappedData,"com.acme:4711");
sendToEclipseDitto(updateRequestDitto);

ModeShape Persistence migration guide

Elastic Search Migration
The instructions are already in the search's new Readme.md, but they should also be made more visible in the migration guide.
@aedelmann we started discussing this, but lost track a bit.
I think there are two dependencies here:
Figuring out what to do with the search integration tests (i.e. access to the machine where they are run and fail due to Allegro not being able to connect to elastic.co). This was in the hands of Tobias last, but I might want to get back in there.
Taking a decision with regards to the actual release we want for this (12.5 is labeled as "bugfix", so probably not - I wouldn't wait until 1.0 either though?)

Hi @somesh-kumar @aedelmann , I've started having a look and so far, I can categorize a couple of those cases, based on the error messages I got from AWS.
However, I'm having a hard time replicating anything consistently - maybe either of you can help me do that locally in an ad-hoc "discovery" session.
Session invalid --> suspect AbstractRepositoryController#unAuthorized --> change logging level would do.
User does not have permissions to access a model --> maybe this matches one or more of the exception handlers in AbstractRepositoryOperation#doInSession? In which case, either lower the logging level to warn or see caller if rethrown?
Invalid characters in search --> we had an initial conversation with Somesh but I forgot where we left it. It seems that spamming a few search requests containing the % character in the prod server consistently fails, but no e-mail seems to be sent after the threshold. The same fails locally, but is intercepted at Spring level. URL-encoding the text at front-end controller level doesn't seem to do anything. @somesh-kumar can we discuss replication again, and the last actions you've taken after our internal discussion? Your last statement was: "still waiting for an exception email to come to me, hoping we get the same error"

Mapping Conditions
If you want to specify a condition, when mapping rules for a Function Block should be applied, you can do this easily with mapping conditions.
Here is an example of using conditions to map to either temperature or illuminance Function Block based on the device payload header.
In this example, only the Temperature Function Block will be mapped, if the type field of header matches the 'T' value.
Function Block Temperature Mapping
...
//mapping rules for Temperature properties
Function Block Illuminance Mapping

//mapping rules for Illuminance properties

PR here.
As mentioned, my change set is weaksauce for now: it only lowers some logging levels to warning.
Per se, this should not be dangerous given the use cases, but it might contribute to clear some of the AWS threshold occurrences.
My take is we can iterate further once this is merged, and see if there is something missed out.

Hi @mena-bosch
With your fix, lets keep an eye on the logs and see if your changes improved it. Nevertheless, I would recommend to specify an Exception Handling concept, with all possible errors that could occur in the system and define the measures that need to be taken. Lets create a separate issue for that. I would close this issue.

Update the migration guide to provide migration instructions after the new search is merged
migration guide for 0.13

@aedelmann @somesh-kumar the branch is here.
I have changed a few things in the migration guide, namely:
Renamed migration_0.11.md to migration.md to contain all migration steps (also the only reference to it in the release-notes.md)
Restructured the file headings hierarchy to reflect multiple versions, and added internal anchors where missing
Added a 0.13 section and a child section about Elasticsearch migration steps
I will now try to troubleshoot the issues with the latest changes with regards to technical user handling, and hopefully somehow come up with documentation about it in the migration guide once I have a better picture on what's going on locally.

You can’t perform that action at this time.
It's in the early works due to a gazillion extraneous issues stepping in-between but it's slowly taking shape.
For now, I just fixed the null technical user values, which allows me to start vorto locally once again after pulling.
Once I have the SQL I can maybe add it to this task - then we can think of whether it's worth exploring a new IUpgradeTask implementation as Erle suggested.
My idea would be to:
Alter the user table and add the technical user boolean if not present
Iterate through users and populate authentication providers (if value not already present) at best, i.e. pretty much only Bosch id if username starts with s-... as far as I can tell (note: does anyone know specs for suite auth ids? is there any applicable pattern?)
Iterate through users again and set technical user (if value not already present) based on authentication provider
Any thoughts?

What do we need for the remaining section "User DB Migration guide"?
@somesh-kumar Not sure.
I thought Erle could shed some light there, if anything was needed.
The only concrete issue I recall was with the Maven dependencies (needed to inject a specific Lucene version in one of the poms to avoid a version clash between ES and Modeshape).
However, I cannot remember any specific operation to perform at DB level.
@erlemantos thoughts?

@mena-bosch @somesh-kumar I can't see anything more that needs to be done except maybe for the removal of extraneous columns that we are not using anymore (authenticationProvider in User table. We renamed it to authenticationProviderId. Having both could be confusing to people looking at our table structure).

Devices may not always send the data structure that is required by the IoT platform. The Vorto Payload Mapping lets you specify how device data is mapped to standardized data structures in form of Vorto Mapping Specifications and execute them in order to transform arbitrary device data to IoT platform specific data.

JAX Magazine: Exploring the IoT universe
Eclipse Vorto to the rescue
Eclipse Vorto: Interoperability for the Internet of Things
April 25, 2016
Jeroen Laverman, Jochen Scheib, Marco Wagner, Olaf Weinmann
#eclipse
#iot
Internet of Things image via Shutterstock
Interoperability is one of the key topics in the Internet of Things – and at the heart of this is the way in which individual, connected components work together. Communication between these elements makes sense only if the underlying language can actually be understood by the devices involved. Yet from a technological perspective, this can be difficult to achieve due to the wide variety of existing communication protocols. As a result, this calls for some means of translating between the individual languages.
Eclipse Vorto is an open source project set up to address this issue. It provides the technical capability required to describe the devices to be interconnected and their messages and helps define relevant mappings for translations. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the project and demonstrate its potential applications based on two detailed examples.
Vorto components
It is common knowledge that industry consortia and standardization organizations are working on various projects to define and standardize abstract descriptions for electronic devices. Some of this work is domain-specific, whereas some reaches across domain boundaries. Eclipse Vorto deliberately takes a technological approach that does not prescribe any one standard. Instead, it provides a handy toolkit designed to integrate smart devices into IoT platforms or applications, reduce the development work required, and facilitate interoperability. Vorto consists of the following three technical components:
Vorto IoT toolset
Vorto repository
Code generator infrastructure
The IoT toolset is a well-structured and easy-to-use Eclipse application that enables users to create device descriptions known as “information models” on the basis of Vorto DSL (domain- specific language). As well as standard features such as syntax highlighting, auto completion, validation, etc., the toolset also offers integration with the Vorto Repository, which allows users to browse, check in, and check out information models. Code generators can also be run from within the toolset.
The key to Vorto component usability is ensuring that users do not have new formats “forced” on them. That’s why Vorto offers mechanisms that allow users to incorporate code generators, as these can convert Vorto-format device descriptions into different formats. Available formats include programming languages such as Java and C++, as well as formats for documentation purposes such as Markdown representations. It is also possible, however, to transform the models into formats defined by the standardization organizations and industry consortia mentioned above. Ultimately this means that users can retain their previously chosen format for device abstraction while still benefiting from the features of the Vorto project.
Example: communication in an automotive environment
Bosch Corporate Research is currently conducting a research project that uses Eclipse Vorto to describe the vehicle-to-cloud interface. The key data and services required for communication at this vehicle-to-cloud interface can be represented using Vorto. This makes these services and data available in a machine-readable format, which in turn makes automatic processing much simpler. In addition, the use of a common description language breaks down the barriers that still exist between the (physical) vehicle world and the (virtual) Internet of Things.

Properties
Properties describe both read-only and read-write state of a digital twin. Read-only properties are defined as status properties, whereas read-write properties as configuration properties. For example, a device serial number may be a status property and the temperature set point on a thermostat may be a configuration property.
Function Block property is defined as a Model Property
Status Property Example
...
status {
mandatory serialNumber as string
}
}
Configuration Property Example
...
configuration {
optional temperature as float <MIN 0, MAX 35> "writable temperature with a range constraint"
mandatory enable as boolean "enables the sensor to start sending data"
}
}
Event
Events define data that is emitted by the device or entity. This kind of data would need to be transmitted to an IoT business solution in a reliable way.
An Event property is defined as a Model Property

The Vorto project is an approach to leverage the standardization of so called Information Models. Information models are abstract representations of real world devices following a meta information model which is also part of the project. The meta information model is very flexible and easy to use. In addition, the project scope includes an eclipse based toolset that allows for creating information models, a repository for finding, managing and sharing information models, and last but not least a set of code generators that allow for the creation of information model based code artifacts to be employed in specific solutions.

Services can also offer events that others can subscribe to. For example, to actually use the vehicle after warming it up, you need some charge in the battery. In this case, the battery could offer a service that allows you to check the battery charge level – and a “low battery” message would also be useful. An extract of the description can be seen in Listing 1, which uses the examples of the BatteryStatus and VehicleCommonDataType data types defined by W3C Vehicle Data [1].
// File: Vehicle.infomodel

operations {

}
// File: BatteryStatus.type

To generate code for communication on the basis of the descriptions discussed above, you also need corresponding mappings. These contain information on addressing modes, for example, as well as other protocol specifications used by the code generator.
A demonstrator was set up to evaluate the concept and to show how all the information required for communication can be generated on the basis of the existing Vorto description. It consists of three components: The electronic control unit (ECU) provides a service (e.g. Battery), which is made available to an external application via the connectivity control unit (CCU).
ASOME/IP implementation is used for communication inside the vehicle. SOME/IP is a service-oriented middleware solution specially developed and standardized for the automotive industry. External communication with the application makes use of the RESTful protocol CoAP, which is widely used in IoT environments.
Eclipse Californium is put to use here: the CoAP server and client implementations based on Eclipse Californium are currently being generated on the CoAP side. Looking beyond what is possible today, one option for SOME/IP in the future would be to generate the configuration file, which contains information including the description of the services. Eventually, the mapping table available in the CCU, which is used to translate between the two protocols, can be generated from the Vorto model and the mappings for CoAP and SOME/IP.
SEE ALSO: A simple way to look at Eclipse IoT
Example: interoperability in the Industry 4.0 environment
The semantic description of machines and field devices is playing an increasingly important role in industrial automation, particularly in the context of the fourth industrial revolution and the Internet of Things. Bosch Rexroth is one of several companies investigating potential applications for semantic descriptions in industrial automation.
The modularization of machines offers an opportunity to reduce complexity and increase the reusability of source code. Coupled with the distribution of the application across multiple resources, this facilitates the development of a flexible control architecture. One prerequisite is an efficient communication infrastructure that makes communication possible both locally and across a network infrastructure.
A further prerequisite is a description of the interfaces in order to enable interoperable communication. Bosch Rexroth is therefore carrying out projects to investigate various possibilities, including the use of the Eclipse Vorto Toolset in combination with technologies that are already established and standardized in industrial automation, such as AutomationML.
Representing production systems in the form of skills makes it possible to describe the underlying technical potential provided by a resource in a production system [2]. Resources can be divided into three basic categories:
Mechatronic systems (e.g. autonomous production systems and machines)
Mechatronic machine modules (self-contained assemblies such as a gripper)
Mechatronic device components (i.e. field devices [3])

Currently reserved words like "status" or "fault" cannot be part of a namespace name.
It needs to be decided whether to allow the usage or it must be prominently documented that this is not permitted (similar to #2382).
Error messages must be displayed in case the user enters an invalid namespace name (see also #2394).

I would strongly suggest to allow fault, as it has a specific semantic meaning and should not be replace with something like error or failure. Remember: a defect can lead to a fault which can cause a failure - all three very distinct things.

Allowing as many keywords in namespaces as possible by the grammar.
'fault', 'status', 'events', 'operations', 'breakable', 'category', 'configuration', 'description' will be allowed.

The classes in the generators module also need to be checked for the right license headers.
Xtend, Xtext and JS files also need to be included in the scan.

Eclipse Vorto offers an optimum way to describe the skills of resources. What it does not offer, however, is a means of storing interdisciplinary information. This might include additional engineering data such as CAD drawings, process behaviors, or documentation on individual resources. Information from the overall system context (e.g. installation site and equipment identifier) also lies outside the scope of Vorto, even though this information is extremely important for developing production systems.
It is in this context that AutomationML has established itself as a container format in many areas of industrial automation. AutomationML is an XML format based on the CAEX standard (IEC 62424), and is used to describe system topologies, geometries and kinematics (COLLADA), logic and behavior (PLCopen XML) and semantics on the basis of libraries [4].
Embedding is carried out through a reference to the corresponding information model in the local or public Vorto Repository. References to external resources used by a specific resource can be modeled by a corresponding relation (interface) in AutomationML. Thanks to AutomationML’s instance hierarchy, it is then possible to model a complete production system. This is shown here based on a sample system.
The next step in the project is to investigate the potential applications of Vorto code generators in order to generate a communication framework for programmable logic controllers and enable the networking of resources.

Actually dateTime is fine to use in the repository, since it automatically lowercases all namespaces.

Why
3rd party users of Vorto can use the Repository with their own JWT Provider containing technical users.
This requires an API which allows to plugin a Vorto the provider easily and configure the repository with it. There are no "core" or UI changes needed in order to use each provider.
Proposal of the API
IRepositoryOAuthProvider {
String getID() //e.g. SiemensID
boolean verify(IAuthentication token)
}
The Vorto Repository "ships" with implementations for this API, namely Github, BoschID, BoschIoTSuiteOAuth

Allow Repository to run as multiple node cluster
#1929
This is a direct continuation of the work for #2088, which has been merged to development in the meantime.
After discussing today with @erlemantos , I realized the persistence of a string representing the subject should actually take place when creating a technical user.
The only logical point where an administrator creates a technical user is when they are adding a (new) user to a namespace.
Therefore, the modal I created in #2088 needs to be completed with a required text field stating the "subject".
That field will require validation both on the front-end and back-end - will need to figure out what exactly constitutes a valid string representing a subject.
Persisting the additional field should be trivial as the table design already has it and it'll just be about writing trivial logic at controller / back-end level.

In some cases, the editor creates duplicates of the operation and event properties.
namespace myNamespace
version 0.1.0
displayname "DO"
description "Digital Output"
status {
mandatory DO as boolean "if the output is active=true or inactive=false"
}
operations {
on() "activates the output"
}
events {
}
}
After saving, the model is modified to:
vortolang 1.0
namespace myNamespace
version 0.1.0
displayname "DO"
description "Digital Output"
Back to the top
modelReference: 'using' qualifiedName ';' version;
description: STRING
Property: Please refer to chapter Model Property for details
Example
vortolang 1.0
namespace com.mycompany
version 1.0.0
entity Color {
mandatory red as int <MIN 0, MAX 255> "The red component of a color"
mandatory green as int <MIN 0, MAX 255> "The green component of a color"
mandatory blue as int <MIN 0, MAX 255> "The blue component of a color"
}
Dictionary
A dictionary describes values in a map.
Example
mandatory lookupTable as dictionary[string, Color] "Lookup table conversion for color"
mandatory lookupRGBTable as dictionary[Color, RGB] "Lookup table conversion for color from description to RGB"
mandatory temperatureLabelConversion as dictionary[int, string] "map of temperature to description"
mandatory simpleMap as dictionary "example of a map with no key and value types"

Among the many issues spotted when running Elasticsearch integration tests on the CI environment, there is one that has not been addressed yet, and is failing some of the tests with errors.
See empty pull requests #2237 and #2238 (used to test whether concurrency of ES tests works now that the installation directory is specified).
The issue at hand is a timeout to actually spin up the Elasticsearch runtime at Allegro's level.
This experimental task is about trying to specify a much larger timeout to accommodate with the machine's limitations.

Why?
The current repository only supports vertical scaling in order to scale with the increasing amount of requests for models. In order to meet SLA high availability requirements as well as prepare for cross-regional Vorto Model Management (Europe, Asia, etc), we would need be able to spin up another node of the repository that takes model requests and propagates changes to other participating (cross-regional) nodes.
Technical implementation:
Upgrade Modeshape to latest version 5.x which supports multiple node clusters.
Confirmation:
Configuration of environment profiles for multi node setup (local, dev, prod)
Green/blue Deployment (Zero downtime)

Note on subject validation: at the moment I'm just using a 4+ alnum rule.
This can be fine-tuned relatively easily in the future, although it has to be done in both front-end and back-end.

This is at best a marginally cosmetic issue.
In the manage section, the owners of a given namespace are listed, but not sorted (e.g. alphabetically or lexicographically).
For a namespace with enough owners, this can be a little ugly.

Why?
For the integration of the Vorto Repository by other systems, it is essential to support the validation of oauth2 tokens in the server in order to allow access to repository resources.
An example would be a provisioning service that requires a model at runtime to provision a device based on the meta-data, defined in the Vorto model. The service would need to authenticate with its token in the repository, whereby the repository would check the validity of the token if the issuer of the token is known/trusted.
Another example, where Access is denied, if the it says 'read_access' but a model is tried to be imported.

Looks like the jenkins builds on the two concurrent "empty" PRs I used for testing this is green. Waiting for finalization of the travis build in case something else comes up - otherwise we might have a winner here finally (although only continued usage will tell if those measures were good enough).

When searching for models I can use a wildcard () at the end of my query but not at the beginning. I want to search for models which contain a search string in their name. That is currently not possible. Example:

This issue relates to a few issues already created, namely #2217 and #2224 - none of which solved the original problem so far.

* modal for technical user creation now also prompts for subject (required, pattern-validated)
* DTO, controller and back-end now validate, handle and persist the subject
* few changes in adding user to tenant, e.g. button disabled until some username typed (previous implementation was not working and loading animations are still useless pretty much all over the place still now)
* added some failsafes when handling search vs actual usernames in form

I would expect to find all models which contain the search string 'Illum' but the result is empty. I can also not specify the wildcard () at the beginning of the expression thus makes it impossible to find the Vorto model "SimpleIlluminance"

#2217 was about randomizing ports to avoid collisions between parallel builds when running Allegro+ES but it was not sufficient to prevent issues that ultimately failed the tests (e.g. later issues were about Allegro "unable" to access the /tmp folders it requires for temp data, broadly speaking).
#2224 tackled the problem at Jenkins level, by attempting to throttle concurrent builds. Aside from the fact that it doesn't seem to work at least when builds are (re-)started manually, it seems a bit overkill to limit our build concurrency just for some integration tests to work.
The current situation leaves 3 options open (in order of priority to investigate):
Investigate the Allegro framework to see if we didn't miss out an existing option to allow running it concurrently
If not, either consider getting rid of Allegro altogether and spinning a Docker container with ES directly (port randomization would then be very relevant)
Or, investigate the Allegro source itself and find a way to allow concurrent runs - then propose it in the project and use a fork in the meantime
Will start with n. 1 shortly.

/api/v1/search/models?expression=namespace:<namespace>* - wildcard search
Since we are using "name:<part of model id>" as a search expression right now, maybe we can change this to "modelId:<part of model Id>" so we can use "name:<name>*" to do an exact or wildcard search on the name field of the modelId, just to harmonize our API.
So, in effect:
/api/v1/search/models?expression=namespace:<namespace> - exact search on namespace
/api/v1/search/models?expression=namespace:<namespace>* - wildcard search on namespace
/api/v1/search/models?expression=name:<name> - exact search on name of modelId
/api/v1/search/models?expression=name:<name>* - wildcard search on name of modelId
/api/v1/search/models?expression=version:<version> - exact search on version of modelId
/api/v1/search/models?expression=version:<version>* - wildcard search on version of modelId
/api/v1/search/models?expression=modelId:<any parts of the modelId> - our current "name:<expr>" search

Currently looking at the search and documenting as I go. Currently the free-text search seems to be using match prefixes for all values (it actually appends an asterisk if none present). Also not sure about robustness of edge-case where multiple identical search tags are used. Happy to take this if no one currently working on.

Prior to the new search, models were searchable by type without a tag.
This has been removed in the new search to avoid confusion between type and name, i.e. only name can be searched untagged.
However, I omitted the part of the Javascript controller that handles the types drop-down: it needs to prepend the "type:" tag to the search expression sent to the back-end.
Otherwise, the type search would be interpreted as a name search, and since the untagged name search also covers the description, it would always yield all models for that type.
The fix is trivial and just consists in pre-pending the type tag when using anything but "all types" in the relevant dropdown.

This is a speculative resolution for a problem we have noticed only recently.
One (or more) of the integration tests for ElasticSearch was failing to reindex a model when during the build on the Jenkins side, showing a socket timeout exception.
Given how those tests work (an ES runtime is launched by Allegro on specific ports), I suspect that multiple concurrent builds testing the ES integration tests at the same time might actually be stepping on each others' feet, when the build processes are not isolated.
I will try and randomize the ports used to spin the service with the following rules:
must be 4 digit ports
must not be the production ES ports, or other obvious entries

Nov 12, 2019
Hi @stheves , I am looking at this ticket at the moment.
My understanding is that the ticket underlines two problems with the search:
No full support for wildcard searches - this is simply not implemented (yet). Only a final wildcard works (it is in fact added automatically in the web GUI when searching for names, but not in REST).
Multiple free-text (i.e. untagged) terms don't play well with each other.
I have started working on a broader change to the search when most notably:
Multiple wildcards per term would be supported (e.g. *Ill?m*)
For clarity, only the name search would allow untagged terms, while e.g. the model type would
require a tag i.e. type:InformationModel (or not so useful but still supported: type:*nformation*)
And many other improvements...
The problem with this approach essentially boils down to time - it would be a non trivial change and require significant documentation.
My questions for you:
Are my assumptions with regards to your requirement correct? If not, can we maybe clarify on gitter?
What is the urgency of your requirement? Could it wait for the full change, e.g. end of December or would you rather have some prototype done more urgently?
Thanks

Regarding point 1 - research what Allegro offers in terms of build/test parallelism.
There is a section of their documentation that specifically addresses this...
... but fails to provide clarity on our specific use case.
We already have PopularProperties.TRANSPORT_TCP_PORT and PopularProperties.HTTP_PORT randomized per implementation of #2217 , which did solve one of the issues but not the overall problem.
We do not use withInstallationDirectory, so that section of the docs is either inaccurate (cannot reuse same installation dir when using concurrently) or irrelevant to our case.
Per @t-gauss ' changes, we are using withInResourceLocation pointing to a zip with ES.
Things to try
Specify a randomized withInstallationDirectory for each running test, or
Not clean the installation directory (withCleanInstallationDirectoryOnStop(false) - defaults to true when not specified).
These experiments will require:
Having two fake pull requests to run concurrent builds
Unblocking our pipeline (currently stuck at yet another compliance issue only @t-gauss can waive)
Will wait until tomorrow and get cracking again if all goes well.

Motivation
Currently we support multiple oauth providers that can be managed as collaborators. However, at the moment, we cannot differentiate between a GitHub or a BoschID user. If a 3rd party oauth provider is added, possibly holding the same userID as GitHub, we would run into a clash.
Solution
Store the provider ID together with the user in the user management DB.
Confirmations:
(Automated) DB Migration of existing users, that add the provider ID to each user entry (BoschIDs start with S-*** and have a fixed length whereby GitHub users can be arbitrary. The migration script should be able to detect and handle it properly
During User Registration process, the user and its provider ID are stored in the user management DB
Assignment of technical collaborators to a namespace, would automatically create a technical user account in the Vorto Repository, if not exists
Under namespace management, all collaborators are displayed with their corresponding provider IDs as well as a namespace admin must specify the provider ID when adding a collaborator to his/her namespace.

On page vorto/docs/tutorials/create_mapping_pipeline.md , image vorto/docs/images/tutorials/decouple_tutorial/overview.png , in section "Decouple IoT solutions from connected device data" I suggest that "Payload" be changed to "Payload Format" /"Normalised Format". Also, a new Vorto Model block be added that feeds into the existing Vorto Middleware block, and the existing Vorto block be renamed. I include a crude image showing the suggested changes.

Hi @mena-bosch , for us it would be sufficient to have a wildcard at the beginning and at the end of a search query e.g. *illum*. It would also be helpful if the search works case-insensitive, meaning a search query *IlluM* and *illum* will return the same results or at least we can specify how the cases should be treated by the search API. We do not need other wildcards e.g. "?".
This feature request here is not urgent. We can wait until the end of December, no problem.

@aedelmann elaborating with a few questions:
I don't understand the difference between a "technical" user and just a user - the code base has plenty of variable names / methods called ...technicalUser... but I seem to have trouble conceptually on this one. Is it a matter of permissions?
By subject, do you mean contextually to security, i.e. as opposed to principal?
Let me know if discussing here suits, or whether we should take this offline.

Looks like this solved one problem, aka the socket timeouts, but still does not allow multiple non-isolated builds running the ElasticSearch tests concurrently - maybe it's just a limitation on Allegro's side...
Working with @t-gauss to see if we can't force throttling builds.
Not sure what could be an alternative solution should that fail, save for disabling those tests (which does not sound like a great idea).

@andrew-from-pretoria , thinking of changing the sentence to "Let's design an architecture, that makes our application being able to consume data from any geolocation sensor vendor, with the help of Vorto Mapping Specifications."
The How? in my opinion is quite important, which in this case is the mapping engine. What do you feel?

This seems to have partially worked, but the tests then complained about timeouts to start ES emanating from Allegro itself.
Looks like the default value was 15".
I changed it to a more generous 1' in #2242.
After merging the latest into those PRs and running them concurrently, I can see everything green again, which I find encouraging.
There is no 100% certainty these cumulated tweaks will hold indefinitely, but it's encouraging enough.
Will have to monitor a while longer but I think I can close this and #2242.

Hi @mena-bosch
You are right. Currently I do not see any difference between a technical or an end user. Both are managed in the same way with their roles. However, what we are missing is the information about where the user originates from, eg. Github, BoschID or BoschIoTSuiteAuth. If the latter, it is a actually a technical user. Hence, I changed the issue context a bit, see confirmations.
I can share with you the concept in the Wiki Page what we are doing for the Device Provisioning process. That it might get clearer :)

added this to To Do
Why?
When users are using the Vorto Repository particularly when editing models or creating mapping specifications, hardly any backend communication is done. This could potentially lead to session time outs when they make a backend request after such a long period of time, which discards users hard work.
Solution:
Sending of frequent heart-beats to backend

@somesh-kumar How about: "One of the challenges faced in IoT is that vendors use their own payload representations. JSON and CSV are two examples of payload representations. Vorto Mapping Specifications together with Normalisation Middleware is a mechanism we will use to normalise the various payload representations. Once this has been done, our application will be able to consume data originating from any geolocation sensor vendor. To achieve this, a Vorto Mapping specification must first be written for each expected payload representation."

Hi @stheves, just a quick heads up: there is a big feature refresh of the search in the works - it has been merged to the development machine already although not yet released to production. The update covers this request as well as others, and is aimed at making the search more powerful, versatile and documented. Worth noticing in your case, it will allow you to use wildcards everywhere in the values, and will also be case-insensitive. We're still working through some obstacles, namely the new integration tests for the search require some connectivity that the development machine currently does not have, but I'm hoping this will be resolved soon. Thanks for your patience!

Cool. I had to push again just now because I stupidly left one of the two malformed links out, but am hoping this is the last bit.
After that, the one thing we may want to do is to recreate the index on the dev machine first, to verify it works as expected.
This is a crucial step in my opinion, otherwise the search will not work as expected due to the schema changes (namely, the few "key to text" type changes).
If no issue there, we can proceed with prod in time.

at the moment, you must specify the version, I am afraid. Though, It is an interesting idea of yours to specify something like LATEST, as in maven. Will look into that.

I don't understand the difference between a "technical" user and just a user - the code base has plenty of variable names / methods called ...technicalUser... but I seem to have trouble conceptually on this one. Is it a matter of permissions?
From a technical perspective, the difference between a technical user and an ordinary user is when adding a collaborator to a namespace.
If we are adding a normal collaborator to a namespace, we check if the collaborator already exist (has already registered). We flag it as an error if he doesn't yet exist.
If we are adding a technical user, we don't check if he already exist. We create him if he doesn't yet exist, then add him to the namespace.

Good point: Can we add this to the migration guide 0.12.x -> 1.0 ?
@somesh-kumar : We need to mention the needed changes, with the introduction of mode shape5 there as well.
@aedelmann Thanks for mentioning this. Having a look at the existing 0.11 guide now. I will probably have questions for you e.g. tomorrow.
Something you can probably answer right away if you're still up: do we want the version change and addendum to migration_0.11.md to be part of the change set for the feature itself, i.e. same branch, or do we scope it to a separate one?

@aedelmann nearly done here.
Suspect we eliminate the other endpoint ("/public") too, and therefore the entire the controller, so that public models for tenant are also directly searched from angular. As I recall, tenant == namespace so I'd just need to call the search with 'namespace:'+tenant.defaultNamespace+'visibility:public' in angular.
I would rather do this in a new task for cleanliness, assuming you agree with the reasoning above.

Had a few thoughts about this.
My idea might seem a bit drastic so @somesh-kumar @kolotu feel free to counter-argue.
TL;DR
Make the banner modal so nothing "behind" it can be clicked
Remove the "save your work" part. Unlikely that the user will want to copypaste text from the model's detail and place it somewhere else temporarily, also given the long time of inactivity.
Bottomline, since at that point the session is unrecoverable, the banner should just display the link redirecting to the login page, saying something along the lines of "your session expired, please login again".
We have a long enough session timeout with warnings in between so losing one's work at this point should be acceptable.
Will start working in that direction soon if no objections.

My idea for this issue is to create a new AngularJS service that sets a timeout to 5 minutes before the session expires. After that timeout expired a warning will be displayed to the user with a countdown and a button to extend the session.
That service can then be reused in all relevant controllers.
I'm currently looking into a way to query the session timeout from the backend, so if the configuration there changes, the change will also be reflected in the UI.

Unfortunately, this is not working with "latest" nor "LATEST", if TAG replaces version, e.g. "1.0.0".
The requests always results with 406 - not acceptable.

Wrapping this up in a "workflow" from the admin perspective.
An administrator needs to add a user to a namespace.
For now, we do not care about the origin of the add request and consider it as manual work for the administrator.
For technical users, we might want to provide some candy at some point, to semi-automatize the process.
The administrator selects the namespace, then types the user ID in the text box. An auto-complete mechanism is in place, that also searches for existing users all across .
a. If the user exists, the unmodifiable details regarding OAuth provider (unmodifiable dropdown) and whether it is a technical user (edit-disabled checkbox) appear below the user name. Upon confirming, the user is added to the namespace with no further operation.
b. If the user does not exist, the administrator is prompted to select from a drop-down of supported authentication providers (for now, github or bosch id) and notified that the user can only be added as technical user. Upon confirming, the user is persisted along with their provider and information on whether technical or not .
Basically there are:
Two new UI elements (user provider representation - dropdown, and technical user - checkbox).
A new listener associated to an existing UI element (auto-complete and user search in text box)
Maybe also an "alert" before adding a new user as technical user (this can also be handled by checking and disabling the relevant checkbox, and adding a succint message somewhere)
Agreed :)

Elaborating on the above:
Grey semi-transparent div covering whole real estate when both warning and session expired banners occur
The content "behind" it is scrollable but not clickable
The only way to "un-freeze" the vorto content at this point is to click on the modal's button, whether it's to extend the session or navigate back to the login page depending on the case
Removed the "save your work" part when session unrecoverable

Remaining problem
At this time, we are not supporting suit OAuth as a provider, and we cannot assume Bosch ID users (and let alone GitHub users) are technical users
As such, the only "guessing" we can do with regards to a user being technical is when the administrator wants to add them when they don't already exist
This seems to imply that, for now, we persist an additional flag for users specifying whether they are technical or not
Similarly, the migration script can only do one thing in that regard, which is to assume users that have not been added as technical are in fact, not technical. Of course the migration script can also guess the provider based on the id, and once suite oauth is supported, it may be able to guess whether the user is technical based on whether their provider is suite oauth or not - but that's not for right now.
@aedelmann @erlemantos will start working towards that direction - do not hesitate to get back to me if I am still missing the point somewhere here. Also do we have any plans for suite oauth integration?

Taking back my last "remaining problem": the suite auth provider seems to be expressed as one of 3 enum types, so while I cannot see the actual authentication mechanism implemented anywhere, at least the checks should work already.

Taking back my last "remaining problem": the suite auth provider seems to be expressed as one of 3 enum types, so while I cannot see the actual authentication mechanism implemented anywhere, at least the checks should work already.
This is legacy code and this enum should be removed because we should not statically define oauth providers in our system. The https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/development/repository/repository-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/vorto/repository/oauth/IOAuthProviderRegistry.java provides a way to dynamically look up configured oauth providers in the system.
If the user does not exist, the administrator is prompted to select from a drop-down of supported authentication providers (for now, github or bosch id) and notified that the user can only be added as technical user. Upon confirming, the user is persisted along with their provider and information on whether technical or not .
We supporting Github, BoschID, BoschIoTSuiteAuth currently. Please refer to the registry (comment above) how to resolve them.
Hi @mena-bosch

@aedelmann did you re-create the index before testing?
This bit of code is dependent on the new search feature, which is itself dependent on re-creating the index, as we discussed last week.
Not doing so will prevent the search from working appropriately, as it will throw query string queries at fields still indexed as keys rather than text.

@aedelmann looks like my search criteria was exactly following the requirements in the description, i.e. state:Released namespace:org.eclipse.vorto.* . As expected, that would only load namespaces from vorto that have a sub-package. Will fix that shortly and replace with state:Released namespace:org.eclipse.vorto

* Grey semi-transparent div covering whole real estate when both warning and session expired banners occur
* The content "behind" it is scrollable but not clickable
* The only way to "un-freeze" the vorto content at this point is to click on the modal's button, whether it's to extend the session or navigate back to the login page depending on the case
* Removed the "save your work" part when session unrecoverable

Just to re-confirm your statement, that any provider which is supported in Vorto, allows to store technical users, that means currently, GitHub, BoschID and BoschIoTSuiteAuth, correct ?

Taking back my last "remaining problem": the suite auth provider seems to be expressed as one of 3 enum types, so while I cannot see the actual authentication mechanism implemented anywhere, at least the checks should work already.
This is already fixed in a code I'm trying to pull request. Will ping you when this is done.
This seems to imply that, for now, we persist an additional flag for users specifying whether they are technical or not
This is also being included in a code i'm trying to pull request now. Basically, we add a isTechnicalUser flag to the User domain object, and also a isTechnicalUser flag in the Collaborator object (the object you use in the REST request).
I will ping you when the pull request pulls through.

Linking tickets for better visibility: in #2180, I have pushed a simple SQL script that does the following:
Adds a boolean IS_TECHNICAL_USER field to the USER table if not present
Adds a string AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER_ID field to the USER table if not present
(note: does not add a AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER field as it seems redundant after talking to @aedelmann. @erlemantos we should probably discuss the new table design as we did not quite understand why there were two such fields together)
Adds a string SUBJECT field to the USER table if not present
(note: not sure how to use this in migration - probably it can only be populated when the user actually logs in?)
Sets the AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER_ID to 'BOSCH-ID' with constraint: (USERNAME LIKE 'S-%-%-%-%-%-%-%' AND CHAR_LENGTH(USERNAME) = 47)
Sets the AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER_ID to 'GITHUB' with constraint: (USERNAME NOT LIKE 'S-%-%-%-%-%-%-%' OR CHAR_LENGTH(USERNAME) <> 47)
Sets all existing users to not technical
I cannot yet test this on the dev environment at this time, due to complications with AWS.
Again, I suspect we want to discuss further when @erlemantos is back.
That script is not pull-requested yet either.
Finally, as discussed I will now get back to the "add tenant to namespace" UI - i.e. this scope, while trying to keep it barebones (as the legacy Angular JS framework is too complicated for me to do much in terms of UX).

Back to working on this after a lot of sidetracking...
Thinking back on the following:
Under namespace management, all collaborators are displayed with their corresponding provider IDs as well as a namespace admin must specify the provider ID when adding a collaborator to his/her namespace.
--> Ok for the first part, but shouldn't the second part be restricted to adding new users?
What sense does it make to ask for the authentication provider ID of existing users, when our DB will already contain that data (which is why we can display it in the first place for existing collaborators)?
My interpretation is:
Admin adds user to namespace
User exists? Added and Bob's your uncle
User does not exist? Admin prompted to add as technical user with specific authentication provider ID chosen from supported set
This workflow would slightly differ from:
If we are adding a normal collaborator to a namespace, we check if the collaborator already exist (has already registered). We flag it as an error if he doesn't yet exist.
If we are adding a technical user, we don't check if he already exist. We create him if he doesn't yet exist, then add him to the namespace.
--> because we would never reach an error state again when a user does not exist. We would simply do the check first, and if the user does not exist, only create it as technical user after prompting the admin.
My final and unresolved dilemma - assuming the ideas above make sense to you guys - is: can we and should we enforce creation of technical users only for a subset of the authentication providers available? I vaguely recall broaching this during a phone call with @aedelmann but sadly, got side-tracked too many times to remember what was the outcome, assuming there was one.
TL;DR
I'm going to get back to coding under the assumptions above until further notice - give me a shout if I'm mistaken. So:
Additional modal for non-existing users, prompting for creation of tech user with authentication provider of admin's choice (no limitations enforced for now) - this will factually replace the "User does not exist" error

LATEST API fails on /api/v1/models/<modelId>/file · Issue #2570 · eclipse/vorto · GitHub
Small UI/UX improvements:
* nicer design /spacing for the new "create technical user form"
* add user autofocuses on the user name input box

* #2088:
Large UI/UX improvements:
* User search when adding to namespace, with a drop down activating once user input field text length is >= 4 characters
* Search retrieves users whose name contains search characters, shows and adds to drop-down
* If no option selected or none available, username interpreted as is (can still be added as non-existing / technical user then)
Signed-off-by: Menahem Julien Raccah Lisei <menahemjulien.raccahlisei@bosch-si.com>
* #2088:
* Made user search case-insensitive (not well optimized, sadly)
* Added a few tests for search
* Removed some extraneous import in TenantTechnicalUserDto

* #2088:
* Cleaned up some code

* Added a couple of account service tests (note that user and tenant repositories are mocked by the parent class, so the only applicable tests are the ones that will fail due to validation issues)

The model details controller talks to the back-end twice in a row, first seemingly to get the "best" permission the user has on the model, then to get all of them.
The ModelRepositoryController provides two very similar endpoints, respectively, for that purpose.
While there is little indication that this redundancy impacts much on model loading performance, it still could be improved by somehow "merging" the two REST calls into one, and re-organizing the way data from the responses is utilized in the AngularJS controller.
That would at least spare one round trip per model loaded when users are authenticated.

Tentatively closing this as scoped for authentication providers only. The subject part is handled by #2208 and presently being pullrequested (I expect it will go through once we deal with the compliance issues that have been popping up en masse these past few days).

This is actually resolved by #2599 for the UI, as the policies fetching is part of the single-payload strategy now, and the calculation of the "best" policy available for the user is done without extra networking.

As discovered by @t-gauss , there is an edge case that prevents programmatic invocations of find etc. methods in repositories annotated with @Cacheable when starting a Vorto repository from scratch, or in some test contexts.
This does not replicate when populating the repositories through SQL scripts, but it does when they are populated programmatically, as the @Cacheable annotation retains the empty state after population.
Likely the annotations will be removed in feature #2461, in order to continue adapting the tests.
This task consists in re-enabling them, but also figuring out a proper cache eviction strategy (considering those 3 tables will be typically written to only once, as they represent "runtime-constant" values).

This most likely does not work because the CrudRepository methods have different return types but the results are stored in the same cache (findAll returns a set - find only one object). For the repositories were only findAll is invoked in the project we can enable caching only for findAll and evict the corresponding cache on save(). For the other repositories where find or findOne are used as well we might need different caches or configure them in a different way.

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image

@kolotu I found out: I am using a VPN for access, which reduces strongly my internet speed. It seems that it is timing out (works perfectly if I unplug the VPN). Is there any way for me to change the timeout period?

The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet

Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?

@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

Hi @oscarfh yes the documentation is still up to date - I just tried it and was not able to reproduce your issue. Could you please double check your configuration - especially your Github client ID and client secret?
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image

@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?

I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

I have double checked the id and secret multiple times. This is the vorto-variables.env file snippet

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<id>

then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml

that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml
vorto/repository/repository-server/src/main/resources/vorto-repository-config-mysql.json
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB

I have pre-configured the image accordingly now in this PR: eclipse/vorto#2668I'll merge it later or tomorrow
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
it's merged now - you can use the nightly image to get the updated container
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?

I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
Ok thanks @kolotu .
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation
Michael van Niekerk
@mvniekerk
It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.
Tobias Månsson

Ok I think my understanding is wrong:The *schema.json files are to be a template for new instances of the same thing type to instantiate from? Or with the creation of every new instance of this have all of the *schema.json files then to be uploaded to Ditto for each new instance?

The Ditto Plugin in Vorto has two different options:
Ditto Thing JSON: A representation of a Vorto model as Thing instance in Ditto. This can be used to interact with the Ditto HTTP API (i.e. creating a thing). That's what is in the documentation here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things
JSON Schema: This is to validate the payload of the messages from/to the Thing in Ditto during runtime. The validation is not performed by Ditto and therefore it cannot be imported. It is supposed to be used as a template for your own implementation.

Ok thanks @kolotu .

If you reference a Functionblock in an InformationModel it is a HAS_A relation

Hi @mvniekerkWith the exported Thing JSON you can use the Ditto APIs that are documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things/post_things

I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann

Ok … then that would make things easier

This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

It also shows up as the definition field. I think the big crux of the story is that these are not inheritable, copy-able or verifiable on the Ditto side but only "suggestions" as to how the payload looks like
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
that is correct - as Vorto only defines the structure of the Thing, the validation also just applies to the structure that is described in Vorto. The actual Thing in Ditto could be changed or modified and thus expect a different payload. So using the schema provided by Vorto is only useful, if the corresponding Thing instance still complies with the structure defined in Vorto

Not quite sure if this is what you meant, but here is a simple example on using the Vorto mapping engine with mapping rules from the vorto repository: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-vorto-converter/blob/main/src/main/java/io/drogue/iot/vorto/Converter.java
Alexander Edelmann
@aedelmann
U can take a look at the running mapping middleware for 3 examples

@aedelmann how to active the examples in http://vorto-middleware.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/#/plugins? I use github account to login , but can not trigger any data in the monitoring screen
Alexander Edelmann
@aedelmann
It’s an example. Follow the getting started to set it up on your local machine with docker

then I run docker-compose rm, I also delete ~/.vorto and /opt/mysql_data to be sure
then docker-compose build and docker-compose up
everything starts as expected, but when I try to log in, I get this page and no messages on the terminal
Is there any way I can increase the log level or anything that could help troubleshooting?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
The problem could be related to the EIDP properties - I used some dummy values in my config. I'd suggest you try the same:EIDP_CLIENT_ID=123EIDP_CLIENT_SECRET=123if that is in fact the root cause, we should amend the file to contain default values

@kolotu I found out: I am using a VPN for access, which reduces strongly my internet speed. It seems that it is timing out (works perfectly if I unplug the VPN). Is there any way for me to change the timeout period?

@ctron
Hi … I got a question about vorto.eclipse.org … how can I make a vorto model I created public?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @ctron to make your model public, it needs to be placed in an official namespace (not starting with vorto.private.*) and someone with the publishing permissions in that namespace can make it public
Jens Reimann
@ctron
So I need to request an official namespace … when it is public, is it possible to fetch the mapping model without a bearer token then? Or is that still a requirement?
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
yes you need to request an official namespace and yes if it's public it can be retrieved without authentication
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Ok … then that would make things easier
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
you can use our mail template to request the official namespace - you can find it on the 'Manage' tab on the UI
Jens Reimann
@ctron
Thanks for the quick answer

the datasource is referencing to the Vorto DB, which is not necessarily the same as the location of the modeshape repository
yes you can add the application.yml and also the json file that is linked in the yml
vorto/repository/repository-server/src/main/resources/vorto-repository-config-mysql.json
In the JSON file is the configuration to put the modeshape repository into the mysql DB
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I have pre-configured the image accordingly now in this PR: eclipse/vorto#2668I'll merge it later or tomorrow

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I don't have a table called modeshape_repository. :(
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
oh okay - let me check what the configuration in the container is. the repository can also be placed on the filesystem

@oscarfh what exactly is timing out? The request to authenticate with GitHub?
oscarfh
@oscarfh
I do not have any logs to confirm that
But it seems so.I click "log in", then "login with github", then I wait for a long time and get the error page
Kevin Olotu
@kolotu
I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

I'm not aware of any option to configure the timeout for that request - we are using the Spring implementation of OAuth, so maybe there is a way to do it, but Vorto itself doesn't offer that option

Hi all. I'm trying to understand where the models are stored, I can't find them in the database.
Tobias Månsson
@tobias-zeptio
I'm asking because when I restart the container I get an error "The workspace 04cb2d318c584743bc5006cfe0de2034 was not found", with the id of my namespace.
I interpret that as it's not able to find the models for that namespace
I would expect the database to have a "models" table or something
I'm runnning the nighly image

Hi @tobias-zeptio the models are stored in the modeshape repository (the data of which is in the DB table MODESHAPE_REPOSITORY), however that data is binary.The modeshape repository contains multiple workspaces. The workspaces are mapped to namespaces in the NAMESPACE table.

Not quite sure if this is what you meant, but here is a simple example on using the Vorto mapping engine with mapping rules from the vorto repository: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-vorto-converter/blob/main/src/main/java/io/drogue/iot/vorto/Converter.java

The request-scoped caching implemented for #2562 and still being developed seems very promising.
The cache now allows handling data for multiple users within the request, which opens the path to using it pretty much in any service implying a request instance is in scope.
However, applying it all over the place without heuristic and specific tests in time could be dangerous, if only because of the large changeset ahead.
In the scope of #2562 , I am applying the cache only for the user roles services.
In this scope, we can look into using the cache for other services (the account service, the user service, etc.), once we are certain the cache in its current implementation yields no regression or other blocking limitation.

Users that do not have PUBLISH permission can see the publish button on the details view. Nothing happens when the user clicks on the button, but it should not be visible to them in the first place.

This is pretty much done already, and has spanned across different tasks.
It has not been applied the totality of the services that would avail of the optimization, but the ones remaining are typically for infrequent or one-time usage (e.g. import, etc. ) - they can be re-visited at later times if deemed relevant.

Replicated. Also worth noting, clicking the Publish button does bring up the warning modal, and accepting the modal does strictly nothing.
Should be solved by just not having the button there, which might however require some magic behind the scenes.
Proceed as follows
Step 1: Installation of Vorto DSL Plugins
Open Eclipse IDE
Download Vorto DSL Plugins and install it as an archive in your Eclipse IDE
Restart your Eclipse
Step 2: Create your DSL Xtext Plugins
Create a new DSL Xtext Project
File > New > Other > Xtext > Xtext Project
Choose a projectname and language name
Specify a file extension for your language, e.g. mysdl
Click on Finish.
After the wizard is finished, it will create five projects for you.
Your Project Browser would look something like this:
org.xtext.example.mydsl (core language plugin)
org.xtext.example.mydsl.ide
org.xtext.example.mydsl.ui
org.xtext.example.mydsl.tests
org.xtext.example.mydsl.ui.tests
Step 3: Reference Vorto Models from your DSL
We are primarily interested in the core language plugin, e.g. org.xtext.example.mydsl.
Open the core language plugin and find the *.xtext grammar file
Replace the content with the following grammar:
grammar org.xtext.example.mydsl.MyDsl with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals

Looks like the GET call to /rest/models/[the model id]/policy for a user without publish permissions gives me
adminPolicy: false
permission: "FULL_ACCESS"
principalId: "MODEL_CREATOR"
principalType: "Role"
... which subsequently allows showing the Publish button.
There might be something wrong with that.

I guess the issue is that the PolicyEntry DTO returned by that controller does not convey the required information on the "tenant user"'s roles for that namespace, which is the one that would have sufficient granularity to differentiate between single buttons such as the "Publish" one.

As you can notice, it imports the Vorto Information Model Ecore and use it from your own DSL grammar.
Open the *.mwe2 Workflow file and add a reference to the Vorto Model Ecore files. Since we only use Vorto Information Models from our DSL, we just reference those.

We have an existing REST endpoint that does not look like it's being used at all:
A call to this would return the namespace user ("tenant user") permissions (which we somehow ended up calling "roles").
Can probably cook up some POC for this, although I will have to think harder in order to have only one REST call within context, before considering for merge.

Discovered what seems to be a related bug, albeit cosmetic: a non-private namespace owner is not advertised to have the right to publish (although they obviously have the manage right).
Suspect the right to publish is implicitly derived from the higher manage privilege, or somehow derived from the namespace ownership any other way, since owners can obviously publish models in their own ns.
It still leads to weird situations where it looks like lambda users may have the right to publish whereas owners do not in appearance.
See example below:
mena-bosch is the owner here, and does not seem to have the right to publish (although he does)
menajrl is a user mena-bosch added with all privileges, aka nominally "one more" than mena-bosch

Open the MANIFEST.MF file and add the following dependencies (under required bundles):
org.eclipse.vorto.core;bundle-version="0.10.0",
org.eclipse.vorto.editor;bundle-version="0.10.0",
org.eclipse.vorto.editor.infomodel;bundle-version="0.10.0"
Step 4: Generate Xtext Source Code
If you are behind proxy, you would need to download ANTLR SDK manually, using the following Update Site: http://download.itemis.com/updates/. Once done so, please restart the IDE and continue with the following steps:
Find the GenerateMyDsl.mwe2 Workflow file in the core plugin project.
Right-click on the file and Run it. This will generate all necessary Xtext source code in order to run your language as an Eclipse Plugin
Now your language is all set. It's time to test it.
Step 5: Run & Test your DSL
Right-click on the core plugin project (e.g. org.xtext.example.mydsl) and run it in a new Eclipse Workbench. A new Eclipse Workbench instance starts up for your language. It automatically loads all Vorto Eclipse Plugins as well as your DSL plugins.
Create a new simple project
Add a new Vorto Information Model file to the project or download it from the Vorto Repository
Here is an example of a Vorto Information Model securitycamera.infomodel:
namespace org.mycompany.demo
version 1.0.0
displayname "Security Camera"
infomodel SecurityCamera {

in reality, both users will have the right to publish as is
TL;DR
Will see if I can bundle a fix for this within this task (as it's more of a cosmetic bug) - otherwise will open another ticket...
Edit I think the fix for the main task deprecates this issue.

Another somehow related bug (this last one might have been introduced by myself with #2208 or more probably, #2088: the first time one adds a user to a namespace, the permission fields are not sent to the back-end, which results in the PUT request failing and the front-end stating "You cannot change your own permission" (completely unrelated) as a boilerplate error message.
Will need to create a separate issue about this one at some point...
Edit this one is still valid and I've formalized it in #2247.

However, the policy DTO seems to return the "best" policy for that user for that model.
Replicating the logic but sending all "policies" instead of the "best" one would allow the right granularity for the job at hand, since we'd just need to check whether the one with principalId equals MODEL_PUBLISHER is present.

Add a new file for your DSL. The autocompletion editor feature kicks in and suggests you the SecurityCamera Information Model to choose for a reference:
Example:
namespace org.mycompany.demo
version 1.0.0
using org.mycompany.demo.SecurityCamera;1.0.0
system SmartBuilding {
cameraFirstFloor as SecurityCamera
cameraSecondFloor as SecurityCamera
}
Congratulations! You have just created a simple Xtext language project which references Vorto Information Models.

GitHub is where the world builds software
Millions of developers and companies build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub — the largest and most advanced development platform in the world.
Note that so far however, updates on a current user for a given namespace do not seem to work, even after logging the user off and back in.

And another note on the above: the REST endpoint already exists - hadn't spotted it at first.
Will see if can use as is.

PR here.
@aedelmann if time allows, could you advise on whether lowering the pre-authorization for the endpoint in question constitutes a risk I don't understand, or is it good to go as is?

The field would reference the username of the user if they went through the human process of signing up, or the "parent" user if this is a technical user, programmatically created by another user.
This would allow:
The possibility to chain-delete technical users by a user who is deleting their account (might cause more damage than it solves)
Some tracking capability, e.g. if ever any abuse of ToS is perpetrated by a technical user, the human person responsible is the user referenced by "createdBy"
This seems a bit over-engineered, but I don't really like the "legal void" around creating puppet users with no bound acknowledgement of the ToS and privacy policy.
A lighter approach would be to display a disclaimer with the usual checkbox for users creating technical users, but without the "createdBy" field, no actual abuse would be trackable (as unrealistic as the occurrence would seem).

I think this would be a good addition, to create a link between human users and technical users acting on their behalf.

Digression
I implemented a gate in the process of creating a technical user on the fly with the "request access to namespace" form (in its standalone, parametrized version - currently the only operation mode allowing on the fly tech user creation).
Essentially it's an additional check box asking the authenticated user to acknowledge that the ToS and privacy policy apply to their user as well as to the technical user they are about to create.
I think I should add this in the "give access to namespace" form as well (need to find shorter names for those forms).
Further more, when the versions of the request form that do not feature yet creating a technical user are changed by #2460 (which would enable e.g. the modal request form to provide with tech user creation), the same checkbox should be in place.
Will create an ad-hoc issue for that.
Even with this additional step in place when ever a user is allowed to create a technical user, I would still justify this "createdBy" field as an additional safety in case something goes wrong.

Aside from the legal aspect, it could also be helpful for managing technical users, to have the link to its creator.

Hi @kolotu
do you have an idea why this is happening ? Might this have sth to do with the caching ?

Notes after discussion:
make the field non-nullable and refer to user id rather than username
while migrating, pre-populate current data with self-references (aka we will "assume" that existing technical users just created themselves), and the application for this will only concern future technical users

I'm pretty sure it has smth to do with the caching. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce it locally yet. I'll look into it.

There is another quite important reason to implement this task, that just came to my mind: while the creation of technical users takes place in the UI by design, there is nothing preventing an observing user from figuring out the REST call in use to create technical users, and automating the creation of any given number of technical users.
The createdBy field could be used to implement a quota of technical users per human user, similar to the one we have in place for private namespaces.
I think this is worth pushing the priority for this task @kolotu way up.

After discussion: the non-null constraint is too tricky to apply.
If we applied it, we'd need to lock the user table when new users sign up to Vorto, since instead of a transparent insert we'd need to specify the created_by id of a new user to be the last ID in the table + 1.
We can still leave the constraint to an existing user ID but make it nullable, and add the relevant defensive code to ensure that if null, the created_by for any given user is to be interpreted as the user's own id ("created themselves").
We can also add an update right after inserting a new user contextually to a human sign up, so the created_by is assigned the generated user ID.

Telling from the logs, it looks like the generator lambda is called, but the generator doesn't respond within 3 seconds, which leads to a timeout and the following exception. So I'd assume that the issue is more related to the generators.

Thanks to @somesh-kumar I've finally found the root cause for this error. The Lambda GeneratorExecutionHandler sets the filename in the Content-Disposition header and adds quotation marks before and after the filename. When deserializing, this is interpreted as an additional quotation mark at the end of the filename (i.e. filename.json" or filename.zip"). That causes the attachment validation in the Vorto Repository to fail.
