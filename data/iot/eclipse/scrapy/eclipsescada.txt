Introduction
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is flexible. It is not an out of the box solution, but a set of tools that can be combined in many different ways. It provides development libraries, interface applications, mass configuration tools, front-end and back-end applications.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is ready to rock. It is used 24/7 in several installations around this world.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ is supported. So if you prefer a fully supported, out of the box instead of a "build it yourself" solution you can contact IBH SYSTEMS GmbH and let us do the job. If you like, you will still get the source code that was developed specially for you.
Eclipse NeoSCADA™ needs you. Writing source code, writing documentation, fixing bugs or providing fresh input. Anything is welcome.

Eclipse SCADA
Eclipse SCADA
The Eclipse SCADA project is a proposed open source project under the
Technology
Container Project.
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the Eclipse
Proposals Forum.
Background
In 2006 we started a series of projects which would at first require
some sort of connectivity to process control hardware and software. It
was obvious that with the upcoming projects more SCADA like
Linux and a JEE environment. Since there was no room for a full blown
SCADA system and also existing solutions on the market did not seem to
fit (or were to expensive), development of a custom SCADA system was
started in these projects. It was clear from the beginning that it
would be hard to place this custom built solution as a commercial
product on the market. Therefore it was decided to create it as a an
open source project from the start. It is currently hosted at http://openscada.org.
Scope
EclipseSCADA provides a state of the art open source SCADA
system, including:
A communication system
An internal communication bus
A framework for implementing driver modules/device adapters
A set of out-of-the-box drivers modules/device adapters
A monitoring system, evaluating gathered data, storing
generated events
A data archive, storing gathered data
Create a reference implementation
A graphical user interface for gathered data, alarms &
events from the monitoring system, archived value data
A system to configure and document the system
Not part of the this project are:
An embedded systems platform (like PLCs or embedded control
systems)
A communication system that transports arbitrary complex data
structures
Description
Definition from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA
SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is a type of
industrial control system (ICS). Industrial control systems are
computer controlled systems that monitor and control industrial
processes that exist in the physical world. SCADA systems
historically distinguish themselves from other ICS systems by being
large scale processes that can include multiple sites, and large
distances.
Simply speaking the primary target of Eclipse SCADA is a way to
connect different industrial devices to a common communication system
and post-process as well as visualize the data to operating personnel.
Since this scheme will also work with non-industrial devices and
devices do become more complex and tend to become software solutions
themselves the term “device” should be more considered as an “other
system”.
The idea of a SCADA system is to provide mostly scalar values
instead of complex data structures. Where necessary data structures
are split up into multiple scalar values. This is done in order to
process the data more quickly and allow common processing of data.
For example a meteo station is providing current weather
information. It can provide temperature and solar radiation. These are
two floating point values which are processed independently. Still the
same alarming schema (high level alarm) can be applied to both values.
The values can both be assigned a quality/alarm information (alarm
state) which can then be shown using the same user interface element
and the same visualization scheme (alarm is displayed with red
background). This way many different scalar values can be processed
exactly the same way.
Why Eclipse?
First of all this project uses several Eclipse technologies like
OSGi, RCP, EMF and a few more. This is the reason why the existing
openSCADA project is technologically already quite close to the
Eclipse project set. Also a lot of code already exists which could be
used by other projects in the Eclipse Foundation.
We hope that bringing openSCADA into Eclipse as Eclipse SCADA
will increase the visibility of the open source SCADA system and
attract other contributors and companies to an open source SCADA
solution. An open source SCADA communication stack could be used by
system integrators and device manufactures to provide a default way of
communicating with devices, in an open source ecosystem. Due to the
connected nature of a SCADA system it is important to have an open
connection infrastructure. As ibh SYSTEMS GmbH we are not in the
position to provide an industry standard way, as an Eclipse project it
would be possible to set a standard together with other industrial
projects in that area. We also do not begin from scratch, since we
already have a working solution.
We as ibh SYSTEMS GmbH of course hope to assist in realizing
such solutions and enhance Eclipse SCADA in future projects as we did
with openSCADA up to now. Yet the Eclipse Foundation provides a much
broader audience.
openSCADA already has a small community and several users. It
has an open communication channel (google group), a wiki and bug
tracker at Atlassian, three publicly accessible git repositories. This
is why we don't see any additional value in migrating to Eclipse Labs.
Initial Contribution
As base for Eclipse SCADA we want to use the existing openSCADA
project source code. The code is currently hosted by ibh SYSTEMS GmbH.
The copyright owners are the proposed committers which already worked
as freelancer on the project as well the companies TH4 SYSTEMS GmbH
(formerly inavare GmbH) and ibh SYSTEMS GmbH.
The source code was originally managed in several subversion
repositories which were converted to git repositories some time ago.
The openSCADA project itself is grouped into different sub-projects in
order to modularize it.
External
Contains all external libraries (except j-interop). This
project will not be contributed. Eclipse Orbit will be used instead.
Aurora
Holds non-user interface utility components
Utgard
The OPC driver implementation, based on j-interop
Oxygen
Implementations of some protocols, mostly openSCADA internal
Atlantis
Non-user interface components of the openSCADA system.
Including driver modules, alarming, archiving.
Orilla
User interface components of the openSCADA system.
Infinity
An SWT based time series chart widget.
Dakara
The Draw2D based vector graphics visualization
Othala
An Eclipse RCP project build which provides the OSTC an
admin/test client for use with openSCADA.
Orion
Some additional user interface components used within the
Eclipse IDE
Tau'ri
Some example projects and setups for demoing openSCADA
Contrib
Some source code that can be used with openSCADA but does not
fit into the release version of openSCADA due to the lack of use,
testing or license issues.
The initial contribution of Eclipse SCADA would be the openSCADA
Git repositories which are currently replicated to:
http://git.openscada.org
https://bitbucket.org/ctron
https://github.com/ctron
The initial components we want to contribute are:
Aurora
Oxgyen
Utgard (as the j-interop dependencies are resolved)
Atlantis
Orilla
Infinity
Othala
Dakara
Deploy
Orion
Note that the Orion component will renamed to avoid confusion
with the Eclipse Orion project.

moment:

Legal Issues
The openSCADA project, which will be the source base for Eclipse
SCADA, is developed by the named contributors (see below). At the
moment the license is LGPLv3, but all contributors have agreed to
change the license to the EPL license for contributing the project
openSCADA to the Eclipse Foundation.
There however several external libraries which openSCADA
requires at the moment which are not EPL. In order to reduce issues
with the upcoming contribution to Eclipse, dependencies were removed
or replaced with versions from the Eclipse Orbit repository. The plan
is to complete this transition for all required libraries for the
openSCADA release 1.2, which is planned to be the initial version
contributed to Eclipse (also see below).
One special case remaining is the library j-interop. This
library and its dependencies are required for one important driver
(OPC driver) of the openSCADA System. Although the system can work
without this driver module, it is a very useful component. Also is
this library used by the Eclipse Project Hudson for the
DCOM/Windows Slave plugin. Possible solutions are: either to remove
the module from Eclipse SCADA and leave it with the openSCADA contrib
repository, or to import j-interop (if not already done) into the
Eclipse Foundation in some way. Since the author of the j-interop
library (Vikram Roopchand) and us worked together in the past and also
contributed to the library, it should be an interesting contribution
to Eclipse in any way. j-interop includes some code from other
libraries (iWombat and GNU Crypto) with incompatible licensing, but
this is easily resolvable with a custom implementation and the use of
bouncycastle (which is licensed under a variant of the MIT X11
License, http://www.bouncycastle.org/licence.html).
Committers
The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to
the project:
