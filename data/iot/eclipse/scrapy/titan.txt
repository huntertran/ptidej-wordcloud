Eclipse Titan is a TTCN-3 compilation and execution environment with an Eclipse-based IDE.
TTCN-3 is a modular language specifically designed for testing (the acronym itself stands for Test and Test Conformance Notation), standardized by ETSI (see www.ttcn-3.org) and endorsed by ITU.
The user of the tool can develop test cases, test execution logic and build the executable test suite for several platforms.
Titan consists of a core part, executing in a Unix/Linux-like environment and a set of Eclipse plug-ins.
Titan
Titan compiles and executes test cases. It has four major roles:
* The TTCN-3 design environment provides an efficient way to create the TTCN-3 test suites (called the abstract test suite, ATS). The IDE is Eclipse‑based and is called Titan Designer.
It has editors that provide the usual IDE features for TTCN-3, ASN.1 and the Titan runtime configuration file. Like creating and configuring Titan projects, syntax highlighting, name convention checking, jump to definition, on-the-fly syntax and semantic analysis, simple content assist, outline of the modules, mark occurrences etc. ASN.1 and XSD sources are typically not created by testers, but are coming from specifications. Nevertheless Titan contains a full-featured ASN.1 editor. XSD sources can be viewed, edited and validated by using any Eclipse XML editors capable of validating XSD.
The Designer also allows building the project. It has a built-in Makefile generator for GNU and GCC makes and allows setting Titan compiler and GCC compiler and linker flags. The source code is first compiled by the Titan compiler to C++ code, then external C++ compiler and linker are called to build the executable file (which is called the host controller - HC). The whole building process is invoked and controlled by the Designer and is running in a command line shell in the background .
* The Titan compiler builds an executable test suite (ETS) from the ATS, the test port code (see below) and the Titan runtime library. The ETS is not always directly executable as the TTCN-3 language and Titan allows very flexible runtime parameterization of the test cases (e.g. IP addresses, port numbers etc. in the lab); the values of runtime parameters need not be defined in development time - though default values can be specified-, but they can be provided just before the test execution session. In this way flexible execution scenarios can be created without re-building the ETS;
* Titan runtime control has several tasks:
- the Titan Main Controller (MC) read and distributes to all test components the runtime configuration parameters;
- it controls the execution of test cases in a distributed multiplatform environment;
- it keeps up and running the test system: in case of a runtime error, Titan runtime control cleans up the test system, assigns an "error" verdict to the given test case and starts execution of the next test case);
- it produces logs in different formats; Titan has a logging API and logging is done via plugins. Currently we have plugins for Titan’s own textual log format and for Jenkins (junit format). Thus, developing a new logging plugin, e.g. for LTTng doesn’t require much knowledge of Titan's code. Several logging mechanisms may be activated at the same time. Logging can be configured by verbosity and by event types. Logs can be written into files or be send to another process or via a network connection to a 3rd party tool.
Titan contains two MC implementations: a command line MC and an MC implemented in the Titan Executor Eclipse plugin.
* Command line log post-processing utilities and the Eclipse-based Titan LogViewer help analyzing the test results. These tools currently process Titan's own log format only.
In a model-based testing (MBT) scenario, the test cases generated from the model are necessarily abstract, as the model itself does not contain low level information. Therefore the abstract test cases has to be completed by a test harness, to become executable test cases. TTCN-3 and Titan in several projects have proved to be an ideal platform for developing the test harness, for integrating the generated abstract test cases with the test harness and the test environment, and for test execution.
Though Titan is told to be "a TTCN-3 test tool", in fact it is able to use TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD and IDL specifications describing the message and signal structures at the tested interfaces. ASN.1 is imported directly, while XSD and IDL are first converted to TTCN-3 and then the generated TTCN-3 modules are used in the projects. In case of XSD the TTCN-3 module is decorated with XML encoding instructions. Titan also supports codec control decorators in TTCN-3 files for binary and textual protocol encodings. Defining the test configurations and the dynamic behaviour of the tests are written in TTCN-3. Functions written in C/C++ can be also be called in the TTCN-3 code.

Test Ports
The TTCN-3 code is generic: the interfaces between the tester and the tested entity (SUT, AUT etc.) are specified at the level of the exchanged abstract data messages and signals. Setting up and maintaining the transport connections, and sending/receving "real" messages and signals are the tasks of interface adaptors. Adaptors are called test ports (TPs) and are plugins written in C++. Titan has a C++ API for adaptors that complete the ATS with the connectivity layer(s) between the test system and the SUT.
Titan test port (adaptors) included into this project proposal provide the following capabilities:
Name
Function
Implementation language
TCP
Provides communicatin over TCP-type connections in IP networks. It uses the Absrtact Socket library, therefore its supports the features of the Abstract Socket described below. Connections can be static for the time of the test case (opened/starts listening at the TTCN-3 map operation and closed at unmap) or can be opened/closed dynamically from the TTCN-3 code. Multiple TCP connections are supported by one port instance.
C++
UDP
Provides UDP-type connections in IP networks. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's UDP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port can handle multiple UDP connections.
C++
TELNET
Allows using remote telnet login from TTCN-3 via the TCP layer of the operating system. The test port supports client and server mode operation. In server mode operation the Telnet Test Port can handle one connection simultaneously. Supports the capabilities of Network Virtual Terminal. Telnet connection parameters (login creadentials, terminal type, prompt format with or without wildcards etc.) can be configured in Titan's runtime configuration file.
C++
SQL
The SQL test port executes SQL statement against the SQL database. The SQL test port is able to handle different SQL engines and databases, and provides an unified interface towards them. Currently MySQL, SQLite C API-s are supported (and required from the database).
C++
PIPE
The PIPE test port is developed to execute shell commands from the TTCN-3 test suite. It provides abstract service primitives to communicate with the user. The stdin, stdout and stderr of the process are returned to the user.
C++
SCTP
ProvidesSCTP-type connections in IP networks. It maps between Titan's test port API and Linux kernel's SCTP socket services; supports open socket, close socket, send and receive data. One test port instance can handle multiple SCTP connections in either server or client mode.
C++
HTTP
Allows sending and receiving HTTP messages between the test suite and SUT via a TCP/IP connection. It uses the Abstract Socket library. Both IP version 4 and 6 are supported and it can handle multiple connections.
C++
PCAP
The PCAP test port has basically two operating modes.
In reading mode, it is able to process recorded network traffic, saved in a file in libpcap format (used e.g. also by the open source Wireshark tool), and decode various application layer protocol messages. These messages are then delivered to TTCN-3.
In capturing mode the test port can be used to capture Ethernet packets to a file, controlled from the TTCN-3 environment.
Filtering of messages can be set both at capturing and reading modes.
C++
LANL2
Allows communicating with the SUT at the low level Ethernet connectivity. The test port translates the LANL2 service primitives (ASPs) and messages (PDUs) sent from the TTCN-3 code to Ethernet II frames when sending and translates the received packets to LANL2 ASPs att receipt. The test port uses the Packet Socket on Linux and the DLPI interface on Solaris (using DLIOCRAW mode).
C++
SIP
Handles SIP connections; The test port can handle SIP request and SIP response messages and it can use both UDP and TCP connection to send and receive messages. The built in encoder can encode SIP request and SIP response messages and it is possible to send raw and fragmented [28] messages trough the test port. The name of the header can be encoded in short or long format.
In basic mode the test port can handle only one TCP connection or one UDP socket. It is not possible to send and receive messages using both protocols at the same time, but the test port can switch between protocols and remote hosts.
In advanced mode the test port can handle several TCP connections and listen on both UDP and TCP ports at the same time. Each connection is distinguished by the protocol id, remote host name and the remote port number.
The test port used to be compatible with ETSI's SIP type definitions, therefore ETSI SIP library could be used with it. ETSI has slightly changed one of its type definition lately, therefore the test port needs to be updated to be compatible with ETSI's LibSip v2.0.
C++
Abstract Socket
It is not a test port, but a library that can be used to build test ports that are using the TCP internet protocol connection; it uses the services provided by the UNIX socket interface and implements basic sending, receiving and socket handling routines. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6, client and server modes and also supports SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1secure connections (the used secure protocol is selected during the SSL handshake automatically).
C++
Protocol Modules
Protocol modules implements static data structure and message encoding/decoding, defined in the specification of the given protocol. Protocols are most often specified by standard bodies for the interfaces, where equipments of different vendors may or need communicate with each other, but of course, interface specifications may also be vendor-specific. Protocol modules can support both cases and shall be in TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD, or IDL (Corba). JSON support is being developed currently. The protocol modules made available in this project proposal are all defined by IETF and all these specifications are publically available.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 is a high-level, abstract language. The code itself is platform independent (e.g. no integer value range or float precision requirements in the language, these are defined by tool implementations; memory allocation is completely solved by tools).
TTCN-3 is test environment independent. In TTCN-3 only the abstract messages/signals, exchanged between the test system and the tested entity (SUT, AUT, etc.) are defined, the transport layers and connections are provided and handled by the tools. Message/signal encoding (serialization) and decoding (deserialization) is completely done by the tool in the background. The user, if wants, can access the encoded data in TTCN-3, and the encoded data is also logged for debugging purposes. TTCN-3 also allows leaving data open in the source code and providing the actual values at execution time (i.e. typically IP- and other addresses, IDs and passwords, SUT/AUT parameters for automatic test case selection etc.). All this allows executing the test cases, unchanged, on different platforms and in different test environments.
The TTCN-3 language has four major parts:
A rich data/type system
It allows describing the messages/signals of practically all possible protocols and APIs.
Except defining data structures in TTCN-3, the language specify the ways of importing other data type/schema languages - as ASN.1, IDL, XSD and currently JSON mapping is being defined, i.e. using them in TTCN-3 test suites without the need of manual conversion. TTCN-3 can also be used as a schema language for XML and JSON (ongoing).
As an extension, Titan also allows adding encoding instructions to TTCN-3 types to automatically encode them in binary (bit-oriented) or (simple) textual forms, XML or JSON (for ASN.1 data BER/CED/DER encodings are supported).
Test configuration
TTCN-3 allows defining multi-process distributed test cases and test execution logic easily (processes are called “test components”). It is the tools' responsibility to deploy and control the test components on the available pool of machines, possibly running different OS-es. The user need not bother about the details (see also the example below). Types of the test components and their interfaces (ports) to other test components and the tested entity are defined in TTCN-3. The number of test component instances and their port connections are controlled from the test case code dynamically, using built-in language statements.
Test dynamic behaviour
TTCN-3 is a procedural programming language specialized for testing. This means that is has the usual programming language features and in addition, constructs needed for testing are built-in the language. Sending/receiving messages, checking the content of the incoming messages, alternative test behaviours depending on the response of the tested entity(including no answer), handling timers and timeouts, logging of events, verdict assignment and collection from the different components of the test system and alike.
Test execution control
Test case execution logic and dynamic test selection can be controlled from the TTCN-3 code itself.
TTCN-3 is a dynamically developing language. In 2003, at publication of its first implemented version, it consisted of two documents (core language and operational semantics), 316 pages in total. In 2005, in TTCN-3 edition 3, tool implementation parts and interworking with ASN.1 has been added and the language specification was published in 7 documents, on 846 pages in total. The first version of TTCN-3 edition 4, in 2009, added interworking with IDL and XSD that increased the number of published pages to 948 in 8 documents (two earlier parts had been made historical in edition 4) . From 2010 language extensions for real time and performance testing, configuration and deployment, testing of interfaces with continuous signals and some advanced language features are published in separate language extension documents. Up to now 6 language extension packages have been published and today, in June 2014, the whole language specification consists of 1422 pages in 14 documents. ETSI is securing the maintenance and development of the language by establishing a project team from ETSI members. The project is financed from ETSI budget.
Example
The following TTCN-3 code shows a Hello Word! example, but it doesn't simply prints out the string.
The PTC first matches the received message against the pattern specified by the TTCN-3 template t_expected. "hello world!" in all small, all capital or small with capital first letters are allowed. Whitespaces are allowed (also at the beginning and end of the string), but there shall be at least one space between "hello and "world". Exclamation mark is optional. If this match successful, the pass verdict, if unsuccessful, the fail verdict is assigned to the test case and the reason is logged (expected/not the expected message has been received plus the message itself).
module hello_world
{
//====================== Port Types ======================
type port MYPORT message {
inout charstring
//====================== Component Types ======================
type component MYCOMP {
port MYPORT myport
}
//====================== Constants ======================
const charstring ws0 := "(\n| )#(0,)"
//====================== Templates ======================
//Strings containing the words "hello" and "world", in all small, or
//all capital letters, or small letters with first letter capital;
//exclamation mark is optional; whitespaces allowed
template charstring t_expected :=
//====================== Functions ======================
alt {
[] myport.receive(t_expected){
setverdict(pass,"expected message received: ",t_expected)
}
[] myport.receive {
setverdict(fail,"not the expected message received: ",t_expected)
}
}
}
//====================== Testcases ======================
testcase TC(charstring pl_toSend) runs on MYCOMP {
var MYCOMP vl_PTC := MYCOMP.create;
connect (self:myport, vl_PTC:myport);
vl_PTC.start(f_PTC());
myport.send(pl_toSend);
vl_PTC.done
}
//=========================================================================
// Control Part
//=========================================================================
control {
var charstring vl_inputs [6] :=
{"HELLO WORLD!","hello world","Hello World!","hello WORD!","hELLO wORLD!","helloworld!"}
var integer i, vl_noStrings := sizeof(vl_inputs);
for (i:=0; i< vl_noStrings; i:=i+1){
execute (TC(vl_inputs[i]))
}
} // end of control
} // end of module
Titan's screenshot, showing the results of the control part's execution is given below. The test case TC has been executed 6 times with different parameters. 3 times execution resulted pass 3 times fail verdict. On the left window at the middle row, the generated log file is shown. Test case results are extracted automatically from it and by clicking on a test case, its log is opened either in a graphical or in a textual/tabular form. In the middle window of the upper row the graphical view the fragment of the last execution of TC can be seen, when the string is received by the PTC and the fail verdict is assigned. By clicking on the "charstring", its content is opening in a value window that can be seen in the window below the graphical log window and at the same time the source code line producing the log event is highlighted in the TTCN-3 editor (rigth window of the middle row). The left window of the top row allows selecting the test cases/control part to be executed and shows the actual status of test components during test case runs.

* Adopt Makefilegen for the Debian packaging
* Support for real-time testing in TITAN
(requires support from the test port being used, see reference guide)
Added compiler option '-I', which enables the real-time testing features mentioned here.
The features are disabled by default, and the new keywords ('now', 'realtime' and 'timestamp')
can be used as identifiers again (for backward compatibility).
Also added makefilegen option '-i', which activates this option for the compiler,
and the makefile setting 'enableRealtimeTesting' in the TPD, which does the same thing.
* New flag for xsd2ttcn
-o: generate all definitions into one module (called XSD_Definitions)

The First TestThe first test will focus on testing the main use case of my thermostat, which is to heat my house if the desired temperature is higher than the current temperature.In other words:TEST STEP 1: simulate that the current temperature is 20 degrees CelsiusTEST STEP 2: set the desired temperature to 22 degrees CelsiusTEST STEP 3: Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to ONTEST STEP 4: simulate that the current temperature reached 23 degreesTEST STEP 5: Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to OFFMy first test
That's it. In five steps, I would be verifying that my thermostat is not broken by any future change I may make in the firmware of my photon, or at least that the main use case is not broken.Of course, if you want more scenarios to be covered, then more test cases can be added later.The TTCN CodeThis is the testcase coded in the TTCN language:testcase test1() {
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 1: simulate that the current temperature is 20 degrees Celsius");
//***************************************************************************
exec(setTargetTmp & " \"20.0\"", RESPONSE_OK);
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 2: set the desired temperature to 22 degrees Celsius");
//***************************************************************************
exec(setTargetTmp & " \"22.0\"", RESPONSE_OK);
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 3: Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to ON");
//***************************************************************************
exec(getOutputs, FAN_ON_HEAT_ON);
//***************************************************************************
6.6.0 Release Review | projects.eclipse.org
log(" TEST STEP 4: simulate that the current temperature reached 23 degrees");
//***************************************************************************
exec(setCurrTmp & " \"23.0\"", RESPONSE_OK);
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 5: Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to OFF");
//***************************************************************************
exec(getOutputs, ALL_OFF);
}
digitalWrite(input, status); // <<-- this actually writes to the PIN
if (input == fan){
fanOutput = status; // <<-- this keeps the status of the PIN in memory
}
}
return coolOutput*4 + heatOutput*2 + fanOutput*1;
}
$ cd particle
$ git clone https://github.com/gusgonnet/minimalistThermostat.git
This creates a particle and a minimalistThermostat folder in it.STEP 3: BUILDBefore running the test, we have to build it. Open a console and run this command:$ cd particle/minimalistThermostat/tests/titan
$ ./build.sh

Eclipse Titan 6.6.0 Release Review
Type: ReleaseState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, June 19, 2019Project: Eclipse TitanRelease:
6.6.0
Description: This release introduces two new experimental Eclipse plug-ins:
-The Eclipse Java code generation plug-in, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/blob/master/usrguide/java_referenceguide/JavaReferenceGuide.adoc
and also: “Tutorial for the Java code generator and executor of the TITAN Eclipse”:

6.4.0 | projects.eclipse.org
6.3.0 Release Review | projects.eclipse.org
Eclipse Titan | projects.eclipse.org
This hopefully created a bin folder and inside you will find the binary called minimalistThermostat.STEP 4: CONFIGUREBefore attempting to run the test, we need to configure the name of the photon used in the minimalistThermostat.cfg file[MODULE_PARAMETERS]
photonName := "cowboy_dentist"
My photon is called cowboy_dentist, what is yours?STEP 5: RUNWe are ready to run now. Open a console and run this command:$ cd particle/minimalistThermostat/tests/titan
$ ./run.sh
STEP 6: VERIFYIf all goes well, the testcase will execute and we will get a pass.This is what we are expecting to see in the console:MTC@linux: Test case test1 finished. Verdict: pass reason: La vie est belle!
That's ItWe can now add new features into our project, refactor the firmware to our desire without the fear of breaking things.By flashing the new firmware and running again our test we can rest assured that everything is working fine.What do you think? Would you be testing your IoT projects in this way?Gustavo.Psst: please find my other projects here.HelpIf you require professional help with your projects, don't hesitate to write me a line about your needs at gusgonnet@gmail.com.

6.5.0 Release Review | projects.eclipse.org
6.3.0 | projects.eclipse.org
6.2.0 | projects.eclipse.org
Note: due to the need to sync the C++ and Java side, a new restriction had to be introduced:
The version of the Eclipse plug-ins has to coincide with the version of the Titan core compiler and executor, else the plug-ins will not work.
This restriction is not present in versions 6.5.0 and earlier.
-The Eclipse Refactoring plug-in, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.EclipsePlug-ins/blob/master/org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring/docs/Titanium_Refactoring_Description/Titanium_Refactoring_Description.adoc
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains the follwing new features:
Support for real-time testing in TITAN(continued from 6.5.0)
Extended 'default' JSON attribute for structured types
New command line option '-p' implemented for TTCN binaries (both in single mode and parallel mode), which lists all module parameters
Printing symbolic version in 'compiler -v'
Legitimized compiler option '-0'
Implementation of the compiler side of map param/unmap param
Colorized compiler error/warning messages

This release is mainly a corrective release, it introduces no major new features. No backward incompatibilities are to be expected, with maybe one exception we see as a minor risk: the fix for
Bug 533767 - RAW encoder ALIGN(right) is working according of specification of ALIGN(left) (and vice versa) for octetstring
may induce under some unlikely circumstances an incompatible behaviour.

* New JSON attribute 'as map'
* Attribute 'text ... as ...' for JSON
* Adopt Makefilegen for the Debian packaging
* Support for real-time testing in TITAN
(requires support from the test port being used, see reference guide)
Added compiler option '-I', which enables the real-time testing features mentioned here.
The features are disabled by default, and the new keywords ('now', 'realtime' and 'timestamp')
can be used as identifiers again (for backward compatibility).
Also added makefilegen option '-i', which activates this option for the compiler,
and the makefile setting 'enableRealtimeTesting' in the TPD, which does the same thing.
* New flag for xsd2ttcn
-o: generate all definitions into one module (called XSD_Definitions)
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verifiedStandards: see ttcn-3.org

GSL:
• new compiler options:
-J: Compiler (and xsd2ttcn, makefilegen) option to read input files list from a text file
-N: ignore UNTAGGED encoding instruction on top level unions (legacy behaviour)
• support of encvalue/decvalue for ASN.1 types
• implemented: ports with translation capability
• support for concatenation of templates
• implemented 'any from' clause and index redirects with the use of the @index modifier (see standard, chapters 21-23)
• support for dynamic erroneous attributes
• implemented @fuzzy support
• no support of Solaris binaries from this release of Titan (older versions of course will continue to support Solaris)
• makefilegen more restrictive on name attribute of the referenced project
• makefilegen: remove generated headers dependency from all .c .cc files
(This will revert the following bugs: Bug 499963 - The generated Makefile does not make full build
when -j switch is present ; Bug 512688 - makefilegen: Incorrect .c and .cc compiling rule )
• XER: allow anytype to be xer enc/decodable
• JSON 'as value' attribute extended for records/sets with one field and for the anytype
• "make archive" button in Eclipse
• support for "make port" command in Eclipse
• plug-in dependencies have been changed to Jung 2.1, Google Guava 21.0 instead of Jung 2.0 and Apache Common Collections.
• IPL4 test port control from config file has been added

We have also seen small-to-medium businesses adopting Titan as part of their test tool portfolio.
The project is operating fully in the open using open source rules of engagement
The source code is hosted publicly partly on GitHub, partly on Eclipse Git repositories.
Bugs and change requests are reported in Eclipse.org's Bugzilla. Discussions are taking place mainly on the Eclipse Titan forum,
or if they are directly code-related, in GitHub, where the contributor workflow is also published.
OpenHub statistics of the Eclipse Titan project:
https://www.openhub.net/p/eclipse_titan/
The project team members have learned the ropes and logistics of being an Eclipse project
We adhere to all processes and policies recommended by the Eclipse organisation.
This version has the following new features:
New compiler options:
-D: disable user and time information generation in the generated files
-e: enforce legacy handling of 'encode' and 'variant' attributes
(see Bug 517843 - Support for multiple encodings›,

Extending TTCN-3 with Model-Based Fuzzing for Robustness Testing of Telecom Protocols
http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/193628/193628.pdf
We have also seen small-to-medium businesses adopting Titan as part of their test tool portfolio.
The project is operating fully in the open using open source rules of engagement
The source code is hosted publicly partly on GitHub, partly on Eclipse Git repositories.
Bugs and change requests are reported in Eclipse.org's Bugzilla. Discussions are taking place mainly on the Eclipse Titan forum,
or if they are directly code-related, in GitHub, where the contributor workflow is also published.
OpenHub statistics of the Eclipse Titan project:
https://www.openhub.net/p/eclipse_titan/
The project team members have learned the ropes and logistics of being an Eclipse project
We adhere to all processes and policies recommended by the Eclipse organisation.
This version has the following new features:
New compiler options:
-D: disable user and time information generation in the generated files
-e: enforce legacy handling of 'encode' and 'variant' attributes
(see Bug 517843 - Support for multiple encodings›,
Bug 522222 - Implement OER coder in TITAN

Release Plan
Review Information
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains new features and backward incompatible changes.
New features:
On the C side the most important new feature is the support of the Object-Oriented Extension of the TTCN-3 standard (please note, it is a feature in progress with some features still missing as described in the Bugzilla bug 552011).
On the Java side we have greatly improved the processing speed by parallelizing some of the operations to make use of multi-core CPUs:

6.6.0 | projects.eclipse.org
* New RAW coding instruction 'FORCEOMIT'
* New JSON attribute 'as map'
* Attribute 'text ... as ...' for JSON
* Adopt Makefilegen for the Debian packaging
* Support for real-time testing in TITAN
(requires support from the test port being used, see reference guide)
Added compiler option '-I', which enables the real-time testing features mentioned here.
The features are disabled by default, and the new keywords ('now', 'realtime' and 'timestamp')
can be used as identifiers again (for backward compatibility).
Also added makefilegen option '-i', which activates this option for the compiler,
and the makefile setting 'enableRealtimeTesting' in the TPD, which does the same thing.
* New flag for xsd2ttcn
-o: generate all definitions into one module (called XSD_Definitions)
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verifiedStandards: see ttcn-3.org
Communities: A thriving community around the Eclipse forum with thousands of regular readers.

Titanium code smell checkers will be run in parallel
The semantic checking of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 modules will be run in parallel (when there is no dependency between the modules)
The syntactic checking (parsing) in case of project hierarchies can be run in parallel on several projects
Also on the Java side we have added support for JSON encoding/decoding.
Backward incomaptible changes:
'omit' matching mechanism is no longer allowed for union fields
To fix a compilation issue in the Java code generator when used with very large modules we had to change where the typedescriptors are generated into the generated code.

Note: due to the need to sync the C++ and Java side, a new restriction had to be introduced:
The version of the Eclipse plug-ins has to coincide with the version of the Titan core compiler and executor, else the plug-ins will not work.
This restriction is not present in versions 6.5.0 and earlier.
-The Eclipse Refactoring plug-in, see:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.EclipsePlug-ins/blob/master/org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring/docs/Titanium_Refactoring_Description/Titanium_Refactoring_Description.adoc
Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains the follwing new features:
Support for real-time testing in TITAN(continued from 6.5.0)
Extended 'default' JSON attribute for structured types
New command line option '-p' implemented for TTCN binaries (both in single mode and parallel mode), which lists all module parameters
Printing symbolic version in 'compiler -v'

Review Information
Eclipse Titan 7.1.0
Primary tabsOverview
Issues
Release Plan
Review Information(active tab)
Description: Next to some bugfixes, the release also contains new features and backward incompatible changes.
New features:
On the C side the most important new feature is the support of the Object-Oriented Extension of the TTCN-3 standard (please note, it is a feature in progress with some features still missing as described in the Bugzilla bug 552011).
On the Java side we have greatly improved the processing speed by parallelizing some of the operations to make use of multi-core CPUs:
Titanium code smell checkers will be run in parallel
The semantic checking of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 modules will be run in parallel (when there is no dependency between the modules)
The syntactic checking (parsing) in case of project hierarchies can be run in parallel on several projects
Also on the Java side we have added support for JSON encoding/decoding.
Backward incomaptible changes:
'omit' matching mechanism is no longer allowed for union fields
To fix a compilation issue in the Java code generator when used with very large modules we had to change where the typedescriptors are generated into the generated code.
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verifiedStandards: see ttcn-3.org
Communities: A thriving community around the Eclipse forum with thousands of regular readers. More and more contributions received.

1. Introduction
1.1. How to read this document
This description contains detailed information on using the TitaniumRefactoring tool.
1.2. Overview of TitaniumRefactoring
1.3. The TITAN implementation of TTCN-3
The TitaniumRefactoring plug-in is extending the TITAN Designer plug-in, which is an implementation of TTCN-3 Core Language standard ([3]), supporting of ASN.1 language ([4]).
The limitations present in the Designer plug-in also apply here: there are TTCN-3 language constructs which are not yet supported in the current version, while there are also some non-standard extensions implemented by TITAN. Information on these limitations and extensions and also some clarifications of how the standard has been implemented in TITAN, can be found in the TITAN Programmer’s Technical Reference.
1.4. Intended audience
This document is intended for users of the TITAN TTCN-3 Test Toolset (product number: 7/CAX 105 7730 R2A).
1.5. Presumed knowledge
This document is intended to be read by users already familiar with the TITAN Designer toolset. For this reason this document includes TITAN related information only when necessary.
Note
This document does not wish to describe elements of Eclipse or Titan, and how to use them. Every time such a feature is described, it is done with simplicity in mind, assuming a minimal level of experience with Integrated Development Environments from the user. However, it is advised to read the manuals of Eclipse and Titan Designer (mainly contained in its included help system), because it can provide better descriptions of the elements.
1.6. Typographical conventions
This document uses the following typographical conventions:
Bold is used to represent graphical user interface (GUI) components such as buttons, menus, menu items, dialog box options, fields and keywords, as well as menu commands. Bold is also used with "+" to represent key combinations. For example, Ctrl + Click
The slash (/) character is used to denote a menu and sub-menu sequence. For example, File / Open.
Monospaced font is used to represent system elements such as command and parameter names, program and path names, URLs, directory names and code examples.
1.7. Installation
For details on installing the TitaniumRefactoring plug-in, see the Installation Guide for TITAN Designer and TITAN Executor for the Eclipse IDE [1].
1.8. How to report an error for the tool
The following information should be included into trouble reports:
a short description of the problem;
what seems to have caused it, or how it can be reproduced;
If the problem is graphical in some way (displaying something wrong), screenshots should also be included;
Output appearing on the TITAN Console or the TITAN Debug Console;
contents of the Error view if it contains some relevant information;
Before reporting a trouble, try to identify whether the trouble really relates to the Titanium plug-in. It might be caused by other third party plug-ins, or by Eclipse itself.
Reporting the contents of the Consoles and the Error log is important as TITAN consoles might display important debug information. The location on which the Error Log view can be opened can change with Eclipse versions, but it is usually found at Window / Show View / Other… / PDE Runtime / Error Log or Window / Show View / Other… / General / Error Log.
2. Getting started
This section explains how to setup Eclipse and the TITAN Designer to access every feature provided by TitaniumRefactoring.
2.1. The perspective
TitaniumRefactoring does not provide its own perspective, for convenience we recommend using the "TITAN Editing" perspective.
For those who have not yet used the TITAN Designer before, it is recommended to read chapter "The TITAN Editing perspective" of the TITAN Designer’s user guide on how to set up a default perspective for working with TTCN-3.
2.2. Setting workbench preferences
In Eclipse, workbench preferences are used to set user specific general rules, which apply to every project; for example, preferred font styles, access to version handling systems and so on.
titan.core/JavaReferenceGuide.adoc at master · eclipse/titan.core · GitHub
Workbench preferences are accessible selecting Window / Preferences. Clicking on the menu item will bring up the preferences page.
This section only concerns the preferences that are available under the TITAN preferences node of this preference tree. There are no preferences in this window concerning the TitaniumRefactoring plugin.
2.3. TITAN preferences
Figure 1. TITAN Preferences
The setting of the TITAN license file is mandatory for the refactoring features to work. Without a valid license the TITAN Designer plug-in will not create the semantic data, that the TitaniumRefactoring plug-in requires to work on.
Note
In case the license file is not provided, is not valid or has expired an additional link will appear on this page. Clicking on this link a browser will open directing the user to a web page where he can order a new license or can ask for a renewal of his existing one.
3. Actions
The TitaniumRefactoring plug-in extends some of the context-sensitive menus of Eclipse where appropriate, providing a convenient way to use the available tools.
3.1. Editor actions
Figure 2. Editor actions context menu
While editing a TTCN-3 source file, the context menu can be opened by right clicking in the editor on some selection. Under the TitaniumRefactoring menu item, the available actions on this file can be found.
Extract definition into a new project: Copies the selected definition and all of its dependencies to a new project. See Chapter Extract definition into a new project for details.

Lazy-fication of formal parameters: Automatically detects formal module parameters where applying the @lazy modifier would be beneficial see Chapter Lazy-fication of formal parameters for details.
Minimize visibility modifiers in module: Minimizes all visibility modifiers in a single module. This means, that all the definitions in the module which can be private are given a private visibility modifier. See Chapter Minimize visibility modifiers in module for details.
Expand value list notation in module: Automatically transforms values given with value list notation into assignment notation. See Chapter Expand value list notation in module for details.
Order value list notation in module: Automatically correct the order of elements in assignment notation to mimic the order seen in the type of the value. See Chapter Order value list notation in module for details.
Add context info to log statements: Adds context info to log statements in the selected piece of code. See Chapter Add context info to log statements for details.
Extract module parameters into a new project: Extracts all module parameters and all of their dependencies from an entire project into a new project. See Chapter Extract module parameters into a new project for details.
Organize imports: Automatically organizes the import statements into lexicographical order, removing all unused imports. See Chapter Organize imports for details.
Ungroup module parameters in module: For all instances where module parameters are declared using the deprecated grouped syntax, automatically replaces them with a separated list of the same module parameters. See Chapter Ungroup module parameters in module for details.
Insert field: This refactoring can be used on record and set types, to add a new field to the type. When a default value is provided for the new field the refactoring will automatically update all usage locations of the type with this default value. See Chapter Insert field for details.

3.2. Project explorer actions
Figure 3. Project explorer context menu
Some of the refactoring operations can work on files, folders or projects. These operations can be found in the Project Explorer context menu, under the TitaniumRefactoring menu item.
Lazy-fication of formal parameters: Automatically detects formal module parameters where applying the @lazy modifier would be beneficial see Chapter Lazy-fication of formal parameters for details.
Minimize visibility modifiers: Minimizes all visibility modifiers in the selected file(s), folder(s) or project(s). This means, that all the definitions in these resources which can be private are given a private visibility modifier. See Chapter Minimize visibility modifiers for details.
Expand value list notation in module: Automatically transforms values given with value list notation into assignment notation. See Chapter Expand value list notation in module for details.
Order value list notation in module: Automatically correct the order of elements in assignment notation to mimic the order seen in the type of the value. See Chapter Order value list notation in module for details.

Change union to select union: Automatically transforms select statements used with a union parameter, to the more specific select union statement. See Chapter Change union to select union for details.
4. Headless mode
The TitaniumRefactoring plug-in offers some commands which can be called in headless mode. This way it can be used from command line, and for example integrated into nightly build systems.
It is important to note, that as in this mode there is no interaction between eclipse and the user, all of the settings should be set beforehand. Otherwise the operation might not be able to work properly, or produce unexpected result.

7.1.0 | projects.eclipse.org
There are two settings that are always important to be set correctly; otherwise the headless mode will not be able to operate correctly:
The license file has to be set in the Designer and it has to be active, otherwise the on-the-fly analyzer will not be able to execute.
The "Display debug information" setting in the Designer has to be turned off. If that option is turned on, the Designer will try to write debug information to the Titan Debug Console, which does not exist in headless mode and the execution aborts.
The on-the-fly analysis of code smells must be enabled on the Code smells preference page under Titanium Preferences, otherwise only the Designer will check the code.
4.2. The general structure of invocation
A generic call to a headless entry point of eclipse follows this pattern:
eclipse.exe -noSplash -data <path to workspace to use> -application <entry point> <parameters>
The items in this call have the following meaning:
Eclipse.exe : this is the binary executable of Eclipse to be used.
"-noSplash": Eclipse should not display even the splash screen.
"-data <path to workspace to use>": The data parameter tells Eclipse which workspace to use. A workspace is usually needed, to work with resources.
"-application <entry point> <parameters>": The application parameter tells Eclipse which entry point to call, and what parameters to pass to that entry point.
An example call could be:
-noSplash -application org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring.definition.ExtractDefinitionHeadlessRunner -data "C:\Users\JohnDoe\workspace" -in proj1 -out ExtDefTest05 -module test -definition funtest -location "D:\Refactoring\Tests\Headless"
4.2.1. Pitfalls
Note
On Linux eclipse should be invoked using the "eclipse" command (without file extension). On Windows we recommend using "eclipse*c*.exe" not "eclipse.exe". The plugins will work with both eclipse versions, but error messages are only printed to the console when using "eclipse*c*.exe". "eclipse.exe" is not able to print to the console it was started from.
5. Extract definition into a new project
Often it is problem in practice to create a set of the contents of a project, which is still able to reproduce some behaviour of the project and is small enough to debug/analyse.

6.6.1 | projects.eclipse.org
5.1. Usage
To extract a definition and all of its dependencies to a new project, right click on a definition identifier in the editor window and choose TitaniumRefactoring / Extract definition from the context menu. If the type of the selection is not supported for the operation, an error message is displayed in the status bar.
If the selection is supported for the operation, then a wizard dialog is presented for the user to specify the name of the new project. Project names that are already present in the workspace are not accepted. After entering the name and clicking on the Finish button, the new project is created and added to the workspace.
Figure 4. Extract definition wizard
5.2. Headless mode
The plug-in also can be called in headless mode, this way it can be used from command line, and for example integrated into nightly build systems.
The entry point can be invoked as:
-noSplash -application org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring.definition.ExtractDefinitionHeadlessRunner -data <Workspace> -in <InputProjectName> -out <OutputProjectName> -module <ModuleName> -definition <DefinitionName> [-location <LocationToPutTheProject>]
5.3. Known limitations
Please note that the "Extract definition" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported; their whole content will be copied without selection.
Note
The algorithm ignores missing references in the source project.
6.1. Usage
The algorithm searches for whole statements in the selection, half selected statements are not included. If the selection does not contain any complete statements, then an error message is displayed in the status bar.
6.2. Known limitations

7. Lazy-fication of formal parameters
7.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select TitaniumRefactoring / Lazy-fication of formal parameters from the editor right-click context menu.
To use the operation on any number of files, folders or projects, select TitaniumRefactoring / Lazy-fication of formal parameters from the Project Explorer right-click context menu.
A wizard dialog is presented for the user to review the changes, before executing them.
7.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Lazy-fication of formal parameters" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported, and so will be skipped by the algorithm.
8. Minimize visibility modifiers
This operation sets the visibility modifier of all definitions in the selected resources to private, where possible. If a definition is referred from another module, its visibility modifier will not be replaced.
8.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select TitaniumRefactoring / Minimize visibility modifiers in module from the editor right-click context menu.
To use the operation on any number of files, folders or projects, select TitaniumRefactoring / Minimize visibility modifiers from the Project Explorer right-click context menu.
8.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Minimize visibility modifiers" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported, and so will be skipped by the algorithm.
9. Expand value list notation
Making the tests easier to understand and maintain.
While it might be tempting to save development time, on not writing out field names in value list notations, this can cause problems during maintenance.
During maintenance reviewing a large data structure, where the values are listed without direct information on what they are assigned to, can add an unnecessary complexity and slow down the effort.
Enhance performance of TIMER::get_min_expiration
Legitimize compiler option '-F'
change the internal representation of octetstring from char[] to byte[] for efficiency
CSN.1 L/H in the RAW codec
change in how xsd files with NoTargetNamespace should be mapped to TTCN-3
Conforms To UI/UX Guidelines: Not verifiedStandards: see ttcn-3.org
Communities: A thriving community around the Eclipse forum with thousands of regular readers. More and more contributions received.

Using this feature, such value list notations are automatically expanded with the names of the fields, making navigation and understanding much easier.
Examples:
//given the type:
type record my_rec {
integer field1,
integer field2
}
// this constant is refactored
//to have more information
9.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select TitaniumRefactoring / Expand value list notation in module from the TTCN-3 editor’s right-click context menu.
To use the operation on any number of files, folders or projects, select TitaniumRefactoring / Expend value list notation from the Project Explorer right-click context menu.
A wizard dialog is presented for the user to review the changes, before executing them.
9.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Expand value list notation" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported.
10. Order value list notation
It can easily happen during the development of a test system, that a value given with an assignment notation, does not follow the order of the original type.
During maintenance this can cause problems. For example checking that a value of a set type has its fields set to the right value, in case of different field ordering, provide an overhead of tracking which field of the type is where in the value.
Using this feature, such assignment list notations are automatically reordered to reflect the order of fields in the original type, making navigation and understanding much easier.
Examples:
//given the type:
type set my_set {
integer field1,

Log local variables before log statement: Adds all local variables that were declared before the log statement.
Only log local variables in the parent block of the log statement: Adds all local variables that were declared before the log statement only in the direct parent block.
Log loop variables: Adds the loop variables from all ancestor loop blocks.
Modify log statements which already log variables: If this option is disabled, only those log statements will be modified which do not log any variables.
11.2. Known limitations
12. Extract module parameters into a new project
12.1. Usage
To extract all module parameters and all of its dependencies to a new project, right click on anywhere in the editor window, or right click on the project, or any file or folders of the project in Package Explorer, and choose TitaniumRefactoring / Extract module parameters from the context menu.
A wizard dialog is presented for the user to specify the name of the new project. Project names that are already present in the workspace are not accepted. After entering the name and clicking on the Finish button, the new project is created and added to the workspace.
Figure 8. Extract module parameters wizard
12.2. Headless mode
The plug-in also can be called in headless mode, this way it can be used from command line, and for example integrated into nightly build systems.
The entry point can be invoked as:
-noSplash -application org.eclipse.titanium.refactoring.modulepar.ExtractModuleParHeadlessRunner -data <Workspace> -in <InputProjectName> -out <OutputProjectName> [ -location <LocationToPutTheProject> ]
12.3. Known limitations
Please note that the "Extract definition" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported; their whole content will be copied without selection.
Note
The algorithm ignores missing references in the source project.
13.1. Usage
After selecting the appropriate options, click on the OK button to finish the operation, or use the Preview action to browse the changes before accepting them.
Figure 9. Minimize scope wizard - modify settings
13.1.1. Settings
Move variable declarations: If this option is disabled, variable declarations will not be moved (just removed if unused and other settings and circumstances allow this)
Move variable declarations when their scope is correct: If this option is disabled, variable declarations will only be moved to a new location if their scope could be narrower.
Remove unused variables: Removes unused variable declarations.
Avoid moving variables with unchecked references in their declaration statements (disabling may alter the refactored code behaviour): Some reference types in a variable declaration are currently not checked for other occurrences in the code. If this option is disabled and a variable declaration contains such unchecked references, then moving this variable (possibly beyond a left-hand-side occurrence of this specific unchecked variable) may result in the change of the code behaviour.
Avoid moving and/or taking apart declaration lists (unused variables can still be removed from them): When large declaration lists with many declarations are moved, the current algorithm doesn’t preserve the declaration list itself, but creates individual declaration statements for each variable declaration. Sometimes this can be annoying, so disabling this option leaves all variables declared in declaration lists unmoved. Unused entries can still be removed from these declaration lists.
13.2. Algorithm behaviour
The main steps of the refactoring operation are the following:
The new scope of a variable V is calculated as the smallest common containing block of all references of this variable let this scope be S.
If the variable V declaration does not contain references to any other variables, then the new location of the declaration is inside S (the new scope), just before the first reference to variable V let this location be L.
If the variable V declaration does contain references to other variables, then all left hand side usages (before the location L, but after the declaration of V) of these other variables are collected and their smallest common containing block is calculated. Let this be S2. The new scope of the variable V will become the smallest common containing block of S and S2 (for clarity: a block contains itself in this case) Let this be S3. The new location of the declaration will be in S3 right before the location of the first reference to V or the first left hand side reference mentioned above (the earliest of these).
If the calculated new scope of a variable is a loop block, then the new scope is going to be the smallest ancestor block of the loop block which is not greater than the original scope. Moving a variable declaration into a loop block even when all references are inside the loop block may result in changed behaviour.
13.3. Known limitations
14. Organize imports
6.2.0 | projects.eclipse.org
When the algorithm encounters an unused import it is removed.
When the algorithm finds that an import is missing, and it can identify which module needs to be imported, the import is inserted.
14.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select TitaniumRefactoring / Organize imports from the TTCN-3 editor’s right-click context menu.
To use the operation on any number of files, folders or projects, select TitaniumRefactoring / Organize imports from the Project Explorer right-click context menu.
A wizard dialog is presented for the user to review the changes, before executing them.
14.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Organize imports" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported.
15. Runs on scope reduction
15.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select TitaniumRefactoring / Runs on scope reduction from the TTCN-3 editor’s right-click context menu.
To use the operation on any number of files, folders or projects, select TitaniumRefactoring / Runs on scope reduction from the Project Explorer right-click context menu.
A wizard dialog is presented for the user to review the changes, before executing them.

Review Information
Release Date: Wednesday, June 21, 2017Deliverables:
Eclipse packaged update site for 6.2.0
and packages for the following binaries have been produced:
Titan 6.2.0 binary for 64 bit RedHat 5 gcc 4.1.2
Please note that the "Runs on scope reduction" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported.
16. Ungroup module parameters
Group style definition of module parameters have been deprecate in the TTCN-3 for a long time and this style is planned to be removed from the standard soon.
This feature lets users update their code automatically to the replacement notation.
Examples:
// this deprecated syntax is refactored
modulepar {
integer mp_1 := 1, mp_2 := 2;
charstring mp_3 := "example";
}
//to the following ungruped version
modulepar integer mp_1 := 1;
modulepar integer mp_2 := 2;
modulepar charstring mp_3 := "example";
16.1. Usage
To use the refactoring operation on a single module, select TitaniumRefactoring / Ungroup module parameters in module from the TTCN-3 editor’s right-click context menu.
To use the operation on any number of files, folders or projects, select TitaniumRefactoring / Ungroup module parameters from the Project Explorer right-click context menu.
A wizard dialog is presented for the user to review the changes, before executing them.
16.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Ungroup module parameters" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported.

The documentation is contained in the packages, or can be downloaded separately as .pdf's.
This release also covers the following test ports:
AbstractSocket CNL 113 384 R8C
Socket API CNL 113 686 R6A
HTTPmsg CNL 113 469 R8G
IPL4asp CNL 113 531 R25B
LANL2asp CNL 113 519 R8B
LDAPasp_RFC4511 CNL 113 513 R4A
To insert a new field into a record or set type, right click on the type definition identifier in the editor window and choose TitaniumRefactoring / Insert field from the context menu. If the type of the selection is not supported for the operation, an error message is displayed in the status bar.
If the selection is supported for the operation, then a wizard dialog is presented for the user to specify the position, name, type and value of the new field. Names that are already present in the selected type definition are not accepted. After this, the produced changes can be reviewed and accepted by clicking on the Finish button.
17.2. Known limitations
Please note that the "Insert field" feature is working only on TTCN-3 files. ASN.1 and pre-processable TTCN-3 files are not supported, and so will be skipped by the algorithm.
Note
The algorithm does not check if the type and the value of the new field are valid.
18. Change union to select union
The TTCN-3 standard has been extended recently with the select union statement, to provide better support for the situation, when several execution path are possible based on the currently selected field of a union typed value.
As the below example shows, previously select statements could be used for this purpose, but were lacking.
The new syntax not only communicates its purpose better, but also allows for checking if all possible fields are covered (leading to safer code).
Examples:
//given the following union type
type union my_union {
integer field1,
integer field2
}
select(true) {
case (ischosen(my_par.field1)) {
...
}
case (ischosen(my_par.field2)) {

19.2. Algorithm behaviour
The main steps of the refactoring operation are the following:
Modules can be excluded from the destinations list by filtering by their name.
The possible new destinations are rated between 0% and 100%, which represents to what degree they are recommended.
After the final destination for the method has been selected, the missing imports are inserted as well into the destination module. The missing imports are those modules, that the method uses but are not among the imported modules of the destination.

Release Plan
Review Information(active tab)
Description:
Information in support of the graduation review:
A working and demonstrable code base with extensible frameworks and exemplary tools
An active framework user (plug-in provider) community.
The received contribution reflect the versatility of the tool itself:
-CANBus test port
-LTTng logger plug-in
-CoAP protocol module additions
An active user community.
The size and activity of the user community can be assessed through the Eclipse Titan forum, which is the main communication channel with our users; questions and observations can be posted here; it is also a media where we post notes and guides about
new or modified features of the tool. Some of these posts have been read by tens of thousands , with a post reaching an audience of nearly 100.000 readers. We also see a continuous stream of downloads of the source code (Github) and published binaries.
An active multi-organization community.
We have seen adopters, users and contributors for many organizations.
Titan became the backbone of several large IoT testing projects:

https://osmocom.org/projects/cellular-infrastructure/wiki/Titan_TTCN3_Notes
https://www.netdevconf.org/2.2/session.html?welte-ttcn3-talk
It is also worth to mention the interest of academia and research for Titan, as reflected in a number of scholarly articles, such as:

We have also seen small-to-medium businesses adopting Titan as part of their test tool portfolio.
The project is operating fully in the open using open source rules of engagement
The source code is hosted publicly partly on GitHub, partly on Eclipse Git repositories.
Bugs and change requests are reported in Eclipse.org's Bugzilla. Discussions are taking place mainly on the Eclipse Titan forum,
or if they are directly code-related, in GitHub, where the contributor workflow is also published.
OpenHub statistics of the Eclipse Titan project:
https://www.openhub.net/p/eclipse_titan/
The project team members have learned the ropes and logistics of being an Eclipse project
We adhere to all processes and policies recommended by the Eclipse organisation.

Description: This release is mainly a corrective release, it introduces no major new features. No backward incompatibilities are to be expected, with maybe one exception we see as a minor risk: the fix for
Bug 533767 - RAW encoder ALIGN(right) is working according of specification of ALIGN(left) (and vice versa) for octetstring
may induce under some unlikely circumstances an incompatible behaviour.

Implement verdict redirect for 'done' statement
str2float should handle special float values
RT2 record equality
string2ttcn to filter patterns of visible characters in octetstrings
Syntax to bind a variant attribute to multiple encodings
TITAN build on Alpine Linux
new tpd tag disableUserInformation

Eclipse Titan 5.5.0 Release Review
Type: ReleaseState: SuccessfulEnd Date of the Review Period: Reviews run for a minimum of one week. The outcome of the review is decided on this date. This is the last day to make comments or ask questions about this review.Wednesday, June 15, 2016Project: Eclipse TitanRelease:
5.5.0
Description: This version CRL 113 200/5 R5A (5.5.pl0) has the following new features:
• clang support in Titan
As an experimental feature we have introduced support for clang 3-8.
Clang comes with the promise of (significantly) reducing the build time , however at the expense of at a reduced execution speed of the generated binary.
This means that we will not recommended it for load generating applications in production phase, but even for these, it can be used during development.
The C++ source code generated and Titan must be compiled with the same version of clang.
We have published Titan built with clang-3.8 for a number of platforms.
(Note: If you need a Titan built with clang for a platform other than published, pls. let us know and we'll see if we can produce it for you;
else, you can build it from scratch yourself based on the source from github:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core)
Makefiles of TTCN-3 projects must be modified by hand as below:
# Your C++ compiler:
# (if you change the platform, you may need to change the compiler)
CXX := clang++-3.8
or regenerated using makefilegen, to use the clang compiler.
Makefilegen will check the version of the C++ compiler used when building Titan and will re-use the same in the generated Makefile.
• config parser/editor based on ANTLR 4
The config parser/editor was switched off in 5.4.0 as we could not finish ANTLR 4 migration in time.
Now the config parser/editor is active again, fully powered by ANTLR 4.
• a new, faster algorithm for semantic analysis implemented in Eclipse Designer
• a new statement of compliance document covering the core language part of the standard
• added negative and positive conformance tests ( about 2100) covering core language part of the standard
• new legacy switches to be considered:
-M: allow 'omit' in template value lists (legacy behavior)
-B: allow selected union field to be unbound (legacy behavior)
• makefilegen -I option to include search paths in .tpd files
• RAW encoder for universal character string
• ISO 10646-conformant unicode syntaxes
• make port command ( similar in effect with 'compiler -t')
• checkstate port operation
• activation of emergency logging when a test fails (optional)
• support for type substitutionGroup
• ttcn2json: extra keyword for restricted "as value" unions
• makefilegen generates -Y if tpd orders it
• user Debug classes
• negative testing support with JSON encoder
• new compiler switch for decreasing variant errorlevel from error to warning
• makefilegen support for commenting out OPENSSL_DIR based on tpd setting
• A number of TRs fixed related to XML, Eclipse plug-ins, JSON
Architectural Issues: A fourth plug-in, a TTCN-3-Java code generator made it's appearance in an incipient form.
The foundations of a debugger in the Titan core have been laid.
Usability Details: The config file editor has been reactivated after migration to ANTLR 4.
Standards: A SoC document was added to describe compatibility with the TTCN-3 Core language part of the standard.
Communities: Lively acivity of the Eclipse Titan forum; some interaction in Bugzilla and github issues.

Provide Eclipse-based and command line log collecting and post-processing utilities.
Provide means for high-level test result- and detailed (low-level) log analysis.
Allow viewing logs in different presentation formats, like graphical. tabular/textual etc.
To help start using the toolset, a few popular, existing IP-based transports and protocols are also submitted to open source.
The following test ports (see the description section) are included into this proposal:
TCP, UDP, TELNET, SQL, PIPE (creating and executing command line shells from TTCN-3), SCTP, HTTP, PCAP (reading wireshark traces into TTCN-3), LANL2 (handling Ethernet frames), SIP, and Abstract Socket (it is not a test port on is own, but a library handling the TCP socket of the Linux kernel; it is used in our test ports and making it easy to develop any new test port that is using TCP).
See more information on the test port's capabilities in the Description section.
The following protocol modules are also included into this proposal:
DHCP, DHCPv6, DNS, DIAMETER, ICMP, ICMPv6, XMPP, RTP, RTSP, SMTP, SNMP.
Any further test ports, protocol modules or generic, non-domain specific libraries, developed by contributors wil be part of this project, as they are technically closely related to the tool (due to using the test port API and message/signal encoding control of Titan).
Test frameworks are domain-specific and often specific to the system under test (SUT), e.g. through managing the SUT via its management interface or accessing the SUTs internal status and data using embedded components. Sharing of libraries and frameworks developed by (Titan) users and contributors is important to the success of the test system, but due to their domain-specific nature they should not be part of this project but should create other projects, related to this one.

-M compiler option:
Enforces legacy behavior when matching the value omit. Allows the use of the value omit in template lists and complemented template lists, giving the user another way to declare templates that match omitted fields. If set, an omitted field will match a template list, if the value omit appears in the list, and it will match a complemented template list, if omit is not in the list (the ifpresent attribute can still be used for matching omitted fields). This also affects the ispresent operation and the present template restriction accordingly.
Target Environments:
Pre-built binaries are made available for:
Linux (GCC 4.3.4, 64-bit, SuSE Enterprise Server 11.1)
Linux (GCC 4.3.2, 32-bit, SuSE Enterprise Desktop 11.0)

Description: This version CRL 113 200/5 R5A (5.5.pl0) has the following new features:
• clang support in Titan
As an experimental feature we have introduced support for clang 3-8.
Clang comes with the promise of (significantly) reducing the build time , however at the expense of at a reduced execution speed of the generated binary.

6.1.0 | projects.eclipse.org
This means that we will not recommended it for load generating applications in production phase, but even for these, it can be used during development.
The C++ source code generated and Titan must be compiled with the same version of clang.
We have published Titan built with clang-3.8 for a number of platforms.
(Note: If you need a Titan built with clang for a platform other than published, pls. let us know and we'll see if we can produce it for you;
else, you can build it from scratch yourself based on the source from github:
https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core)
Makefiles of TTCN-3 projects must be modified by hand as below:
# Your C++ compiler:
# (if you change the platform, you may need to change the compiler)
CXX := clang++-3.8
or regenerated using makefilegen, to use the clang compiler.
Makefilegen will check the version of the C++ compiler used when building Titan and will re-use the same in the generated Makefile.
• config parser/editor based on ANTLR 4
The config parser/editor was switched off in 5.4.0 as we could not finish ANTLR 4 migration in time.
Now the config parser/editor is active again, fully powered by ANTLR 4.
• a new, faster algorithm for semantic analysis implemented in Eclipse Designer
• a new statement of compliance document covering the core language part of the standard
• added negative and positive conformance tests ( about 2100) covering core language part of the standard
• new legacy switches to be considered:
-M: allow 'omit' in template value lists (legacy behavior)
-B: allow selected union field to be unbound (legacy behavior)
• makefilegen -I option to include search paths in .tpd files
• RAW encoder for universal character string
• ISO 10646-conformant unicode syntaxes

• user Debug classes
• negative testing support with JSON encoder
• new compiler switch for decreasing variant errorlevel from error to warning
• makefilegen support for commenting out OPENSSL_DIR based on tpd setting
• A number of TRs fixed related to XML, Eclipse plug-ins, JSON
Architectural Issues: A fourth plug-in, a TTCN-3-Java code generator made it's appearance in an incipient form.
The foundations of a debugger in the Titan core have been laid.
Usability Details: The config file editor has been reactivated after migration to ANTLR 4.
Standards: A SoC document was added to describe compatibility with the TTCN-3 Core language part of the standard.
Communities: Lively acivity of the Eclipse Titan forum; some interaction in Bugzilla and github issues.

Target Environments: The Eclipse plug-ins require Java 1.8 and the Eclipse platform.
The core execution requires a Linux/Unix platform, equipped with gcc(different version) or clang( ver. 3.8), openssl (different versions)., libxml2 and editline.

Story
In this article we will explore one way of testing a project with a tool designed to do just that.
Why Bother Testing?
There are many reasons why one would want to test their products or projects. We can enumerate a few from the wikipedia definition:
it meets the requirements that guided its design and development,
it responds correctly to all kinds of inputs,
it is sufficiently usable
In other words, we test since we want to make sure things work properly.
Why did I want to test my project in particular? Well, since the project I am testing deals with my HVAC at home and that is a pretty expensive piece of hardware, the drawbacks of making a mistake can cost me big bucks. Or injure someone in my family. Or both. So there was no way I could put my project "in production" without testing it first.
Why Automating?
Of course one can test manually all the features of a project. It just takes time to do it. Big time.
Imagine running few tests today to evaluate how good your software behaves. That's fine. Tomorrow you change a little bit and you have to test again to make sure you did not break something. Then the day after tomorrow, then next week and so on. You could end up spending a lot of time verifying your changes didn't break something important on your project or product.
This is when automating your tests starts making sense. From wikipedia, we learn:

In software testing, test automation is the use of special software (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.
Test automation has the advantage to bring down the testing time to minutes or seconds. It also saves you from making mistakes because you may be bored of manually running the tests over and over again.
Some Thoughts on Test Automation
I must admit that all my life I used the term test automation to describe what I do, but after reading this white paper from the folks at Satisfice Inc, I feel the need to change it. From that (very interesting) white paper:
Good testing, like programming, is instead a challenging intellectual process. Tool use in testing must therefore be mediated by people who understand the complexities of tools and of tests. This is true for testing as for development, or indeed as it is for any skilled occupation from carpentry to medicine.
The authors state that testing cannot be automated, same as programming or any other skilled occupation:
To produce high-quality products and services, we need skilled people applying appropriate tools to fulfill the mission of testing.
Conclusion: no more using the test automation term for me. I shall be a toolsmith from now on, since I'd like to follow the suggestion in this paragraph:
Since all testers use tools, we suggest a more interesting distinction is that some testers also make tools—writing code and creating utilities and instruments that aid in testing. We suggest calling such technical testers “toolsmiths.”
The Tool
The tool I will use for creating my tests is called Titan. Titan is TTCN. In 2015, Titan got released as open source. This means I can now use it for my personal projects, and you can too.
Titan celebrated its 15th birthday some days ago so you can believe me when I tell you it's a mature tool:
Happy birthday Titan!
You can find Titan in the Eclipse site here. Installation instructions for Windows or Linux can be found here. You can look at installationguide.pdf and installationguide.pdf inside the compressed file.
The Test Setup
Side note: If you have never used a Particle wifi dev kit before I would suggest you give them a shot. They are really easy to start with, since they come standard with cloud connectivity. You can flash them from your browser. There is a whole ecosystem of applications around them and so many other nice things. Go get one!
This is how my test setup looks like:
My test setup
The First Test
The first test will focus on testing the main use case of my thermostat, which is to heat my house if the desired temperature is higher than the current temperature.
In other words:
TEST STEP 1: simulate that the current temperature is 20 degrees Celsius

TEST STEP 2: set the desired temperature to 22 degrees Celsius
TEST STEP 3: Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to ON
TEST STEP 4: simulate that the current temperature reached 23 degrees
TEST STEP 5: Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to OFF
My first test
That's it. In five steps, I would be verifying that my thermostat is not broken by any future change I may make in the firmware of my photon, or at least that the main use case is not broken.
Of course, if you want more scenarios to be covered, then more test cases can be added later.
The TTCN Code
This is the testcase coded in the TTCN language:
testcase test1() {
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 1: simulate that the current temperature is 20 degrees Celsius");
//***************************************************************************
exec(setTargetTmp & " "20.0"", RESPONSE_OK);
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 2: set the desired temperature to 22 degrees Celsius");
//***************************************************************************
exec(setTargetTmp & " "22.0"", RESPONSE_OK);
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 3: Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to ON");
To use PolyGerrit, please enable JavaScript in your browser settings, and then refresh this page.
//***************************************************************************
exec(getOutputs, FAN_ON_HEAT_ON);
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 4: simulate that the current temperature reached 23 degrees");
//***************************************************************************
exec(setCurrTmp & " "23.0"", RESPONSE_OK);
//***************************************************************************
log(" TEST STEP 5: Verify that the fan and the heat outputs are set to OFF");
//***************************************************************************
exec(getOutputs, ALL_OFF);
}
I purposely removed some lines to make the intent of the test clearer in this article. For the complete code please refer to the software in github.
Verification Points
If you look closely, you will notice that the test has to verify whether the fan and heat outputs are on or off at certain times (eg: when the thermostat is heating).
Since the photon does not allow you to read a pin when it's configured as output, we have to find another way.
NOTE: technically the photon allows you to read an input when it's configured as output, just that by doing so you don't get the value of the output, but the value of an internal state of the pin. Not exactly what we want.
To overcome this kind of limitation, I created a little trick in the firmware of the Photon to make it testable.
Making your Project Testable
There may be many ways of making a project susceptible to being tested. Here I will list the two I thought of, just have in mind is not a conclusive list:
read the outputs with another device

Each one is coming with its pros and cons so let's look at them side by side.
Read the outputs with another device
This approach requires an extra piece of hardware. This could be an extra photon you have lying around, or any other board that we could connect to our computer running Titan, the test tool. This extra board would need to be connected electrically to the photon running the thermostat application so it can read the state of the outputs and verify they are high or low at the right times.
Pros: you know for certain what is the state of the outputs at all times, no modifications required to the firmware under test (the thermostat in our current example)
Cons: it requires an extra board
Keep track of the outputs states in the firmware itself
Pros: simple to implement, does not require an extra board
Cons: the project tested needs to be modified to call a wrapper of digitalWrite()
Which one to choose?
I chose the latter for its simplicity. You might differ in your case, and that is ok.
Surely, I had to modify the thermostat firmware. For this you will find a section called TESTING HACKS in the firmware (see minimalistthermostat.ino) with the sole objective of making my project testable without requiring an extra board. In that section you will find a wrapper for digitalWrite() called myDigitalWrite() and this is where the firmware keeps track of the status of its outputs.
This is the implemented wrapper:
void myDigitalWrite(int input, int status){
digitalWrite(input, status); // <<-- this actually writes to the PIN
if (input == fan){
fanOutput = status; // <<-- this keeps the status of the PIN in memory
}
}
From there you can infer that fanOutput is saving the status of the pin in the Photon's memory.
All the test has to do to find out if the fan is ON is to query that status variable.
How to query a status variable
Adjust serial port properties in SerialPort.cfgRun the tests$ ttcn3_start SerialPortTests SerialPort.cfg

int getOutputs(String dummy){
return coolOutput*4 + heatOutput*2 + fanOutput*1;
}
Running the Test
Let's describe the steps required in order to run the test.
STEP 1: INSTALL TITAN
You can find Titan in the Eclipse site here. Installation instructions for Windows or Linux can be found here. You can look at installationguide.pdf and installationguide.pdf inside the compressed file.
STEP 2: CLONE THE GITHUB REPOSITORY
In a folder of your choice in your laptop, create a new folder called particle. For instance in Linux, I typed in a console the following:
$ mkdir particle
$ cd particle
$ git clone https://github.com/gusgonnet/minimalistThermostat.git
This creates a particle and a minimalistThermostat folder in it.
STEP 3: BUILD
Before running the test, we have to build it. Open a console and run this command:
$ cd particle/minimalistThermostat/tests/titan
$ ./build.sh
This hopefully created a bin folder and inside you will find the binary called minimalistThermostat.
STEP 4: CONFIGURE
Before attempting to run the test, we need to configure the name of the photon used in the minimalistThermostat.cfg file

photonName := "cowboy_dentist"
My photon is called cowboy_dentist, what is yours?
STEP 5: RUN
We are ready to run now. Open a console and run this command:
$ cd particle/minimalistThermostat/tests/titan
$ ./run.sh
STEP 6: VERIFY
If all goes well, the testcase will execute and we will get a pass.
This is what we are expecting to see in the console:
MTC@linux: Test case test1 finished. Verdict: pass reason: La vie est belle!
That's It
We can now add new features into our project, refactor the firmware to our desire without the fear of breaking things.
By flashing the new firmware and running again our test we can rest assured that everything is working fine.
What do you think? Would you be testing your IoT projects in this way?
Gustavo.

This repo is intended to collect TTCN-3 based applications, demo and instructional code etc.
VSBOT is a vulnerability scanner based on TTCN-3
Currently scans for web application vulnerabilities, namely directory traversal, SQL injection and XSS; next to this, it also contains a SYN Flood generator. This is not necessarily meant for industrial usage, it's rather a prototype that can constitute a good starting point to build your own vulnerability scanning application.
The execution is based on TTCN-3 code executed by Titan, with a number of building blocks from the Titan toolbox(test ports etc.) and it also has a Python-based GUI.
Note: As this repository includes submodules, after cloning it, a 'git submodule init' and a 'git submodule update'
will have to be issued.
SIP_ETSI is based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Test Suite from ETSI
(http://www.ttcn-3.org/index.php/downloads/publicts/publicts-etsi/27-publicts-sip)
edited to be compatible with Titan and the SIPmsg test port.
Note: As this repository includes submodules, after cloning it, a 'git submodule init' and a 'git submodule update'
will have to be issued.

Eclipse Titan
Titan
This project proposal, will use the current name of the toolset that is well-known within Ericsson.
What Titan is:
Titan is the TTCN-3-based test toolset widely used within Ericsson, providing Eclipse-based and command line user interfaces, and multi-platform support.
Eclipse Titan | projects.eclipse.org
Titan is an integration and execution environment for test cases generated from models.
Titan supports attended and unattended (nightly) automatic test execution as well as exploratory testing.
Titan can be efficiently used for small testing tasks as well as for huge and complex test scenarios, where the tester has to communicate with the tested entity via many interfaces in a test case, at the same time. A test suite (including a test framework) of about 1M TTCN-3 LOC exists and is being used.
Titan Eclipse components contain approximately 300,000 LOC in Java, the other components contain about 1,600,000 LOC in C++ and other languages (including tests).
What Titan is not?
Titan is not a GUI testing tool.
Titan is not a test tool for low-level high capacity traffic like (Giga)Ethernet, SDH, ATM etc.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 (Test and Test Control Notation version 3) is the standard test specification language, developed and maintained by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI). It is also a worldwide standard as has been endorsed by the ITU-T without technical changes. ETSI standards and ITU-T's TTCN-3 Recommendations are available for free of charge to everyone.
The portal of the TTCN-3 community is at http://www.ttcn-3.org.
A rich bibliography of TTCN-3 related papers can be found at Fraunhofer Fokus's TTCN-3 site and Bernard Stepien's website.
What TTCN-3 is:
"The standardized testing language has the look and feel of a regular programming language but without the complexity that such languages often introduce, as it concentrates exclusively on testing. There are many tutorial and courses to learn TTCN-3, as well as a certification program. The standard itself provides examples that demonstrate the usage of the specific features of the language. The aim of TTCN-3 is to provide a well-defined syntax for the definition of tests independent of any application domain. The abstract nature of a TTCN-3 test system makes it possible to adapt a test system to any test environment. This separation significantly reduces the effort required for maintenance allows experts to concentrate on what to test and not on how."
Source: http://www.ttcn-3.org/index.php/about/why-use-ttcn3
See more details in the Descriptions section.
What TTCN-3 is not:
TTCN-3 is not a telecom-specific language. It is a generic-purpose test language, TTCN-3 is suited for a large variety of application domains:
Mobile and fixed-line communications, telecommunication networks (LTE, WiMAX, 3G, TETRA, GSM, ISDN, SS7 etc.)
Broadband technologies (ATM, DSL)

Status message
This proposal has been approved and the Eclipse Titan project has been created.
Eclipse Titan
Basics
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the community. Please login and add your feedback in the comments section. Parent Project: Eclipse Tools Project
Titan
This project proposal, will use the current name of the toolset that is well-known within Ericsson.
Middleware platforms (WebServices, CORBA, CCM, EJB)
Internet protocols, IP-based networks and applications (SIP, IMS, IPv6, SIGTRAN, XMPP, SOAP and REST based web services and many more)
Smart Cards, ePassport
Automotive (AUTOSAR, MOST, CAN)
TTCN-3 is not object oriented, it is a procedural language. One of the design principles was to specify an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use language.
TTCN-3 is not designed for developing applications, it is a testing language. Nevertheless, several protocols have been implemented with rational limitations in TTCN-3 to bridge the actually tested layer(s) and the truly available transport layers within the test tool.
Standard test suites and libraries
Several standard test suites are available. We have information that TTCN-3 is used e.g. in the automotive industry, however our knowledge is limited to test suites available from 3GPP and ETSI. Test suites for mobile and fixed-line communication, Intelligent Transport Services (ITS), ePassport, etc. are available from these organizations. These are produced for conformance, network integration/end-to-end and interoperability testing. See more information at http://www.ttcn-3.org/index.php/downloads/publicts/publicts-etsi.
Except test suites, ETSI also publishes a number of TTCN-3 libraries for the IP version 6, SIP, Diameter protocols and for ITS. See available libraries at http://www.ttcn-3.org/index.php/development/devlibraries
Scope: The project aims to provide an Eclipse-based IDE for TTCN-3 based test design and execution environment. The following are within the projects scope:
Provide a complete test design, execution and log analysis environment for TTCN-3 within the Eclipse IDE.
Provide a command line test execution and result reporting interface.
Utilize the TTCN-3 standard.
Analyze TTCN-3 code quality and report metrics, code smells, code structure, all kind of information that helps the users to maintain robust and high quality code.
Assist the users in refactoring their TTCN-3 code.
Allow testing of XML interfaces and applications.
Allow testing of JSON interfaces and developing JSON schemas.
Permit the ingestion of ASN.1 and IDL specifications, describing the messaging and signal structures at the tested interfaces.
Utilize the capabilities of other programming languages in TTCN-3 and allow other programming languages to utilize TTCN-3 and/or Titan's advantages.
Provide runtime features for distributed, multi-platform and load-balanced multi-process test execution on POSIX-based operational systems as Linux, Solaris and Cygwin over Windows.
Provide the features to specify test execution logic, like conditional, looped, repeated execution with different sets of test data etc.
Collect local test verdicts from the distributed processes (test components) of the system and calculate the overall test case verdict.

See more details in the Descriptions section.
What TTCN-3 is not:
Provide statistics of attended or unattended test execution sessions.
Generate logs in different possible formats and verbosity during test execution.
Support continuous integration (CI), for example by providing test results for CI tools like Jenkins.
Provide Eclipse-based and command line log collecting and post-processing utilities.
Provide means for high-level test result- and detailed (low-level) log analysis.
Allow viewing logs in different presentation formats, like graphical. tabular/textual etc.
To help start using the toolset, a few popular, existing IP-based transports and protocols are also submitted to open source.
The following test ports (see the description section) are included into this proposal:
TCP, UDP, TELNET, SQL, PIPE (creating and executing command line shells from TTCN-3), SCTP, HTTP, PCAP (reading wireshark traces into TTCN-3), LANL2 (handling Ethernet frames), SIP, and Abstract Socket (it is not a test port on is own, but a library handling the TCP socket of the Linux kernel; it is used in our test ports and making it easy to develop any new test port that is using TCP).
See more information on the test port's capabilities in the Description section.
The following protocol modules are also included into this proposal:
DHCP, DHCPv6, DNS, DIAMETER, ICMP, ICMPv6, XMPP, RTP, RTSP, SMTP, SNMP.
Any further test ports, protocol modules or generic, non-domain specific libraries, developed by contributors wil be part of this project, as they are technically closely related to the tool (due to using the test port API and message/signal encoding control of Titan).
Test frameworks are domain-specific and often specific to the system under test (SUT), e.g. through managing the SUT via its management interface or accessing the SUTs internal status and data using embedded components. Sharing of libraries and frameworks developed by (Titan) users and contributors is important to the success of the test system, but due to their domain-specific nature they should not be part of this project but should create other projects, related to this one.
Description: Titan provides an Eclipse-based IDE for TTCN-3. The user of the tool can develop test cases, test execution logic and build the executable test suite for one or more platforms.
Titan
Titan compiles and executes test cases. It has four major roles:
* The TTCN-3 design environment provides an efficient way to create the TTCN-3 test suites (called the abstract test suite, ATS). The IDE is Eclipse‑based and is called Titan Designer.
It has editors that provide the usual IDE features for TTCN-3, ASN.1 and the Titan runtime configuration file. Like creating and configuring Titan projects, syntax highlighting, name convention checking, jump to definition, on-the-fly syntax and semantic analysis, simple content assist, outline of the modules, mark occurrences etc. ASN.1 and XSD sources are typically not created by testers, but are coming from specifications. Nevertheless Titan contains a full-featured ASN.1 editor. XSD sources can be viewed, edited and validated by using any Eclipse XML editors capable of validating XSD.
The Designer also allows building the project. It has a built-in Makefile generator for GNU and GCC makes and allows setting Titan compiler and GCC compiler and linker flags. The source code is first compiled by the Titan compiler to C++ code, then external C++ compiler and linker are called to build the executable file (which is called the host controller - HC). The whole building process is invoked and controlled by the Designer and is running in a command line shell in the background .

Utilize the capabilities of other programming languages in TTCN-3 and allow other programming languages to utilize TTCN-3 and/or Titan's advantages.
* The Titan compiler builds an executable test suite (ETS) from the ATS, the test port code (see below) and the Titan runtime library. The ETS is not always directly executable as the TTCN-3 language and Titan allows very flexible runtime parameterization of the test cases (e.g. IP addresses, port numbers etc. in the lab); the values of runtime parameters need not be defined in development time - though default values can be specified-, but they can be provided just before the test execution session. In this way flexible execution scenarios can be created without re-building the ETS;
* Titan runtime control has several tasks:
- the Titan Main Controller (MC) read and distributes to all test components the runtime configuration parameters;
- it controls the execution of test cases in a distributed multiplatform environment;
- it keeps up and running the test system: in case of a runtime error, Titan runtime control cleans up the test system, assigns an "error" verdict to the given test case and starts execution of the next test case);
- it produces logs in different formats; Titan has a logging API and logging is done via plugins. Currently we have plugins for Titan’s own textual log format and for Jenkins (junit format). Thus, developing a new logging plugin, e.g. for LTTng doesn’t require much knowledge of Titan's code. Several logging mechanisms may be activated at the same time. Logging can be configured by verbosity and by event types. Logs can be written into files or be send to another process or via a network connection to a 3rd party tool.
Titan contains two MC implementations: a command line MC and an MC implemented in the Titan Executor Eclipse plugin.
* Command line log post-processing utilities and the Eclipse-based Titan LogViewer help analyzing the test results. These tools currently processing Titan's own log format only.
In a model-based testing (MBT) scenario, the test cases generated from the model are necessarily abstract, as the model itself does not contain low level information. Therefore the abstract test cases has to be completed by a test harness, to become executable test cases. TTCN-3 and Titan in several projects have proved to be an ideal platform for developing the test harness, for integrating the generated abstract test cases with the test harness and the test environment, and for test execution.
Though Titan is told to be "a TTCN-3 test tool", in fact it is able to use TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD and IDL specifications describing the message and signal structures at the tested interfaces. ASN.1 is imported directly, while XSD and IDL are first converted to TTCN-3 and then the generated TTCN-3 modules are used in the projects. In case of XSD the TTCN-3 module is decorated with XML encoding instructions. Titan also supports codec control decorators in TTCN-3 files for binary and textual protocol encodings. Defining the test configurations and the dynamic behaviour of the tests are written in TTCN-3. Functions written in C/C++ can be also be called in the TTCN-3 code.
Titan consists of the following components, these are all subject of this project:

Provide runtime features for distributed, multi-platform and load-balanced multi-process test execution on POSIX-based operational systems as Linux, Solaris and Cygwin over Windows.
Provide the features to specify test execution logic, like conditional, looped, repeated execution with different sets of test data etc.
Collect local test verdicts from the distributed processes (test components) of the system and calculate the overall test case verdict.
Provide statistics of attended or unattended test execution sessions.
Generate logs in different possible formats and verbosity during test execution.
Support continuous integration (CI), for example by providing test results for CI tools like Jenkins.
Provide Eclipse-based and command line log collecting and post-processing utilities.
Provide means for high-level test result- and detailed (low-level) log analysis.
Allow viewing logs in different presentation formats, like graphical. tabular/textual etc.
To help start using the toolset, a few popular, existing IP-based transports and protocols are also submitted to open source.
The following test ports (see the description section) are included into this proposal:
TCP, UDP, TELNET, SQL, PIPE (creating and executing command line shells from TTCN-3), SCTP, HTTP, PCAP (reading wireshark traces into TTCN-3), LANL2 (handling Ethernet frames), SIP, and Abstract Socket (it is not a test port on is own, but a library handling the TCP socket of the Linux kernel; it is used in our test ports and making it easy to develop any new test port that is using TCP).
See more information on the test port's capabilities in the Description section.
The following protocol modules are also included into this proposal:
DHCP, DHCPv6, DNS, DIAMETER, ICMP, ICMPv6, XMPP, RTP, RTSP, SMTP, SNMP.
Any further test ports, protocol modules or generic, non-domain specific libraries, developed by contributors wil be part of this project, as they are technically closely related to the tool (due to using the test port API and message/signal encoding control of Titan).
Test frameworks are domain-specific and often specific to the system under test (SUT), e.g. through managing the SUT via its management interface or accessing the SUTs internal status and data using embedded components. Sharing of libraries and frameworks developed by (Titan) users and contributors is important to the success of the test system, but due to their domain-specific nature they should not be part of this project but should create other projects, related to this one.
Description: Titan provides an Eclipse-based IDE for TTCN-3. The user of the tool can develop test cases, test execution logic and build the executable test suite for one or more platforms.

OpenApi 3 support- generator script By: Gábor Szalai on Thu, 12 November 2020

Titan compiles and executes test cases. It has four major roles:
* The TTCN-3 design environment provides an efficient way to create the TTCN-3 test suites (called the abstract test suite, ATS). The IDE is Eclipse‑based and is called Titan Designer.
It has editors that provide the usual IDE features for TTCN-3, ASN.1 and the Titan runtime configuration file. Like creating and configuring Titan projects, syntax highlighting, name convention checking, jump to definition, on-the-fly syntax and semantic analysis, simple content assist, outline of the modules, mark occurrences etc. ASN.1 and XSD sources are typically not created by testers, but are coming from specifications. Nevertheless Titan contains a full-featured ASN.1 editor. XSD sources can be viewed, edited and validated by using any Eclipse XML editors capable of validating XSD.
The Designer also allows building the project. It has a built-in Makefile generator for GNU and GCC makes and allows setting Titan compiler and GCC compiler and linker flags. The source code is first compiled by the Titan compiler to C++ code, then external C++ compiler and linker are called to build the executable file (which is called the host controller - HC). The whole building process is invoked and controlled by the Designer and is running in a command line shell in the background .
* The Titan compiler builds an executable test suite (ETS) from the ATS, the test port code (see below) and the Titan runtime library. The ETS is not always directly executable as the TTCN-3 language and Titan allows very flexible runtime parameterization of the test cases (e.g. IP addresses, port numbers etc. in the lab); the values of runtime parameters need not be defined in development time - though default values can be specified-, but they can be provided just before the test execution session. In this way flexible execution scenarios can be created without re-building the ETS;
* Titan runtime control has several tasks:
- the Titan Main Controller (MC) read and distributes to all test components the runtime configuration parameters;
- it controls the execution of test cases in a distributed multiplatform environment;
- it keeps up and running the test system: in case of a runtime error, Titan runtime control cleans up the test system, assigns an "error" verdict to the given test case and starts execution of the next test case);
- it produces logs in different formats; Titan has a logging API and logging is done via plugins. Currently we have plugins for Titan’s own textual log format and for Jenkins (junit format). Thus, developing a new logging plugin, e.g. for LTTng doesn’t require much knowledge of Titan's code. Several logging mechanisms may be activated at the same time. Logging can be configured by verbosity and by event types. Logs can be written into files or be send to another process or via a network connection to a 3rd party tool.
Titan contains two MC implementations: a command line MC and an MC implemented in the Titan Executor Eclipse plugin.
* Command line log post-processing utilities and the Eclipse-based Titan LogViewer help analyzing the test results. These tools currently processing Titan's own log format only.
In a model-based testing (MBT) scenario, the test cases generated from the model are necessarily abstract, as the model itself does not contain low level information. Therefore the abstract test cases has to be completed by a test harness, to become executable test cases. TTCN-3 and Titan in several projects have proved to be an ideal platform for developing the test harness, for integrating the generated abstract test cases with the test harness and the test environment, and for test execution.
Though Titan is told to be "a TTCN-3 test tool", in fact it is able to use TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD and IDL specifications describing the message and signal structures at the tested interfaces. ASN.1 is imported directly, while XSD and IDL are first converted to TTCN-3 and then the generated TTCN-3 modules are used in the projects. In case of XSD the TTCN-3 module is decorated with XML encoding instructions. Titan also supports codec control decorators in TTCN-3 files for binary and textual protocol encodings. Defining the test configurations and the dynamic behaviour of the tests are written in TTCN-3. Functions written in C/C++ can be also be called in the TTCN-3 code.

Setting up and maintaining the transport connections, and sending/receving "real" messages and signals are the tasks of interface adaptors. Adaptors are called test ports (TPs) and are plugins written in C++. Titan has a C++ API for adaptors that complete the ATS with the connectivity layer(s) between the test system and the SUT.
Titan test port (adaptors) included into this project proposal provide the following capabilities:
Name
Function
C++
PCAP
The PCAP test port has basically two operating modes.
In reading mode, it is able to process recorded network traffic, saved in a file in libpcap format (used e.g. also by the open source Wireshark tool), and decode various application layer protocol messages. These messages are then delivered to TTCN-3.
In capturing mode the test port can be used to capture Ethernet packets to a file, controlled from the TTCN-3 environment.
Filtering of messages can be set both at capturing and reading modes.
C++
LANL2
Allows communicating with the SUT at the low level Ethernet connectivity. The test port translates the LANL2 service primitives (ASPs) and messages (PDUs) sent from the TTCN-3 code to Ethernet II frames when sending and translates the received packets to LANL2 ASPs att receipt. The test port uses the Packet Socket on Linux and the DLPI interface on Solaris (using DLIOCRAW mode).
C++
SIP
Handles SIP connections; The test port can handle SIP request and SIP response messages and it can use both UDP and TCP connection to send and receive messages. The built in encoder can encode SIP request and SIP response messages and it is possible to send raw and fragmented [28] messages trough the test port. The name of the header can be encoded in short or long format.
In basic mode the test port can handle only one TCP connection or one UDP socket. It is not possible to send and receive messages using both protocols at the same time, but the test port can switch between protocols and remote hosts.
In advanced mode the test port can handle several TCP connections and listen on both UDP and TCP ports at the same time. Each connection is distinguished by the protocol id, remote host name and the remote port number.
The test port used to be compatible with ETSI's SIP type definitions, therefore ETSI SIP library could be used with it. ETSI has slightly changed one of its type definition lately, therefore the test port needs to be updated to be compatible with ETSI's LibSip v2.0.
C++
Abstract Socket
It is not a test port, but a library that can be used to build test ports that are using the TCP internet protocol connection; it uses the services provided by the UNIX socket interface and implements basic sending, receiving and socket handling routines. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6, client and server modes and also supports SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1secure connections (the used secure protocol is selected during the SSL handshake automatically).
C++
Protocol Modules
Protocol modules implements static data structure and message encoding/decoding, defined in the specification of the given protocol. Protocols are most often specified by standard bodies for the interfaces, where equipments of different vendors may or need communicate with each other, but of course, interface specifications may also be vendor-specific. Protocol modules can support both cases and shall be in TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD, or IDL (Corba). JSON support is being developed currently. The protocol modules made available in this project proposal are all defined by IETF and all these specifications are publically available.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 is a high-level, abstract language. The code itself is platform independent (e.g. no integer value range or float precision requirements in the language, these are defined by tool implementations; memory allocation is completely solved by tools).

HTTP
Allows sending and receiving HTTP messages between the test suite and SUT via a TCP/IP connection. It uses the Abstract Socket library. Both IP version 4 and 6 are supported and it can handle multiple connections.
C++
PCAP
TTCN-3 is test environment independent. In TTCN-3 only the abstract messages/signals, exchanged between the test system and the tested entity (SUT, AUT, etc.) are defined, the transport layers and connections are provided and handled by the tools. Message/signal encoding (serialization) and decoding (deserialization) is completely done by the tool in the background. The user, if wants, can access the encoded data in TTCN-3, and the encoded data is also logged for debugging purposes. TTCN-3 also allows leaving data open in the source code and providing the actual values at execution time (i.e. typically IP- and other addresses, IDs and passwords, SUT/AUT parameters for automatic test case selection etc.). All this allows executing the test cases, unchanged, on different platforms and in different test environments.
The TTCN-3 language has four major parts:
A rich data/type system
It allows describing the messages/signals of practically all possible protocols and APIs.
Except defining data structures in TTCN-3, the language specify the ways of importing other data type/schema languages - as ASN.1, IDL, XSD and currently JSON mapping is being defined, i.e. using them in TTCN-3 test suites without the need of manual conversion. TTCN-3 can also be used as a schema language for XML and JSON (ongoing).
As an extension, Titan also allows adding encoding instructions to TTCN-3 types to automatically encode them in binary (bit-oriented) or (simple) textual forms, XML or JSON (for ASN.1 data BER/CED/DER encodings are supported).
Test configuration
TTCN-3 allows defining multi-process distributed test cases and test execution logic easily (processes are called “test components”). It is the tools' responsibility to deploy and control the test components on the available pool of machines, possibly running different OS-es. The user need not bother about the details (see also the example below). Types of the test components and their interfaces (ports) to other test components and the tested entity are defined in TTCN-3. The number of test component instances and their port connections are controlled from the test case code dynamically, using built-in language statements.
Test dynamic behaviour
TTCN-3 is a procedural programming language specialized for testing. This means that is has the usual programming language features and in addition, constructs needed for testing are built-in the language. Sending/receiving messages, checking the content of the incoming messages, alternative test behaviours depending on the response of the tested entity(including no answer), handling timers and timeouts, logging of events, verdict assignment and collection from the different components of the test system and alike.
Test execution control
Test case execution logic and dynamic test selection can be controlled from the TTCN-3 code itself.
TTCN-3 is a dynamically developing language. In 2003, at publication of its first implemented version, it consisted of two documents (core language and operational semantics), 316 pages in total. In 2005, in TTCN-3 edition 3, tool implementation parts and interworking with ASN.1 has been added and the language specification was published in 7 documents, on 846 pages in total. The first version of TTCN-3 edition 4, in 2009, added interworking with IDL and XSD that increased the number of published pages to 948 in 8 documents (two earlier parts had been made historical in edition 4) . From 2010 language extensions for real time and performance testing, configuration and deployment, testing of interfaces with continuous signals and some advanced language features are published in separate language extension documents. Up to now 6 language extension packages have been published and today, in June 2014, the whole language specification consists of 1422 pages in 14 documents. ETSI is securing the maintenance and development of the language by establishing a project team from ETSI members. The project is financed from ETSI budget.
Example
The following TTCN-3 code shows a Hello Word! example, but it doesn't simply prints out the string.
The PTC first matches the received message against the pattern specified by the TTCN-3 template t_expected. "hello world!" in all small, all capital or small with capital first letters are allowed. Whitespaces are allowed (also at the beginning and end of the string), but there shall be at least one space between "hello and "world". Exclamation mark is optional. If this match successful, the pass verdict, if unsuccessful, the fail verdict is assigned to the test case and the reason is logged (expected/not the expected message has been received plus the message itself).
module hello_world

In reading mode, it is able to process recorded network traffic, saved in a file in libpcap format (used e.g. also by the open source Wireshark tool), and decode various application layer protocol messages. These messages are then delivered to TTCN-3.
In capturing mode the test port can be used to capture Ethernet packets to a file, controlled from the TTCN-3 environment.
Filtering of messages can be set both at capturing and reading modes.
C++
LANL2
Allows communicating with the SUT at the low level Ethernet connectivity. The test port translates the LANL2 service primitives (ASPs) and messages (PDUs) sent from the TTCN-3 code to Ethernet II frames when sending and translates the received packets to LANL2 ASPs att receipt. The test port uses the Packet Socket on Linux and the DLPI interface on Solaris (using DLIOCRAW mode).
C++
SIP
Handles SIP connections; The test port can handle SIP request and SIP response messages and it can use both UDP and TCP connection to send and receive messages. The built in encoder can encode SIP request and SIP response messages and it is possible to send raw and fragmented [28] messages trough the test port. The name of the header can be encoded in short or long format.
In basic mode the test port can handle only one TCP connection or one UDP socket. It is not possible to send and receive messages using both protocols at the same time, but the test port can switch between protocols and remote hosts.
In advanced mode the test port can handle several TCP connections and listen on both UDP and TCP ports at the same time. Each connection is distinguished by the protocol id, remote host name and the remote port number.
The test port used to be compatible with ETSI's SIP type definitions, therefore ETSI SIP library could be used with it. ETSI has slightly changed one of its type definition lately, therefore the test port needs to be updated to be compatible with ETSI's LibSip v2.0.
C++
Abstract Socket
It is not a test port, but a library that can be used to build test ports that are using the TCP internet protocol connection; it uses the services provided by the UNIX socket interface and implements basic sending, receiving and socket handling routines. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6, client and server modes and also supports SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1secure connections (the used secure protocol is selected during the SSL handshake automatically).
C++
Protocol Modules
Protocol modules implements static data structure and message encoding/decoding, defined in the specification of the given protocol. Protocols are most often specified by standard bodies for the interfaces, where equipments of different vendors may or need communicate with each other, but of course, interface specifications may also be vendor-specific. Protocol modules can support both cases and shall be in TTCN-3, ASN.1, XSD, or IDL (Corba). JSON support is being developed currently. The protocol modules made available in this project proposal are all defined by IETF and all these specifications are publically available.
TTCN-3
TTCN-3 is a high-level, abstract language. The code itself is platform independent (e.g. no integer value range or float precision requirements in the language, these are defined by tool implementations; memory allocation is completely solved by tools).
TTCN-3 is test environment independent. In TTCN-3 only the abstract messages/signals, exchanged between the test system and the tested entity (SUT, AUT, etc.) are defined, the transport layers and connections are provided and handled by the tools. Message/signal encoding (serialization) and decoding (deserialization) is completely done by the tool in the background. The user, if wants, can access the encoded data in TTCN-3, and the encoded data is also logged for debugging purposes. TTCN-3 also allows leaving data open in the source code and providing the actual values at execution time (i.e. typically IP- and other addresses, IDs and passwords, SUT/AUT parameters for automatic test case selection etc.). All this allows executing the test cases, unchanged, on different platforms and in different test environments.

The TTCN-3 language has four major parts:
A rich data/type system
It allows describing the messages/signals of practically all possible protocols and APIs.
Except defining data structures in TTCN-3, the language specify the ways of importing other data type/schema languages - as ASN.1, IDL, XSD and currently JSON mapping is being defined, i.e. using them in TTCN-3 test suites without the need of manual conversion. TTCN-3 can also be used as a schema language for XML and JSON (ongoing).
As an extension, Titan also allows adding encoding instructions to TTCN-3 types to automatically encode them in binary (bit-oriented) or (simple) textual forms, XML or JSON (for ASN.1 data BER/CED/DER encodings are supported).
Test configuration
TTCN-3 allows defining multi-process distributed test cases and test execution logic easily (processes are called “test components”). It is the tools' responsibility to deploy and control the test components on the available pool of machines, possibly running different OS-es. The user need not bother about the details (see also the example below). Types of the test components and their interfaces (ports) to other test components and the tested entity are defined in TTCN-3. The number of test component instances and their port connections are controlled from the test case code dynamically, using built-in language statements.
Test dynamic behaviour
TTCN-3 is a procedural programming language specialized for testing. This means that is has the usual programming language features and in addition, constructs needed for testing are built-in the language. Sending/receiving messages, checking the content of the incoming messages, alternative test behaviours depending on the response of the tested entity(including no answer), handling timers and timeouts, logging of events, verdict assignment and collection from the different components of the test system and alike.
Test execution control
Test case execution logic and dynamic test selection can be controlled from the TTCN-3 code itself.
TTCN-3 is a dynamically developing language. In 2003, at publication of its first implemented version, it consisted of two documents (core language and operational semantics), 316 pages in total. In 2005, in TTCN-3 edition 3, tool implementation parts and interworking with ASN.1 has been added and the language specification was published in 7 documents, on 846 pages in total. The first version of TTCN-3 edition 4, in 2009, added interworking with IDL and XSD that increased the number of published pages to 948 in 8 documents (two earlier parts had been made historical in edition 4) . From 2010 language extensions for real time and performance testing, configuration and deployment, testing of interfaces with continuous signals and some advanced language features are published in separate language extension documents. Up to now 6 language extension packages have been published and today, in June 2014, the whole language specification consists of 1422 pages in 14 documents. ETSI is securing the maintenance and development of the language by establishing a project team from ETSI members. The project is financed from ETSI budget.
Example
The following TTCN-3 code shows a Hello Word! example, but it doesn't simply prints out the string.
The PTC first matches the received message against the pattern specified by the TTCN-3 template t_expected. "hello world!" in all small, all capital or small with capital first letters are allowed. Whitespaces are allowed (also at the beginning and end of the string), but there shall be at least one space between "hello and "world". Exclamation mark is optional. If this match successful, the pass verdict, if unsuccessful, the fail verdict is assigned to the test case and the reason is logged (expected/not the expected message has been received plus the message itself).
module hello_world
{
//====================== Port Types ======================
type port MYPORT message {
var MYCOMP vl_PTC := MYCOMP.create;
connect (self:myport, vl_PTC:myport);
vl_PTC.start(f_PTC());
myport.send(pl_toSend);
vl_PTC.done
}
//=========================================================================
// Control Part
//=========================================================================
control {
var charstring vl_inputs [6] :=
{"HELLO WORLD!","hello world","Hello World!","hello WORD!","hELLO wORLD!","helloworld!"}
var integer i, vl_noStrings := sizeof(vl_inputs);
for (i:=0; i< vl_noStrings; i:=i+1){
execute (TC(vl_inputs[i]))
}
} // end of control
} // end of module
Titan's screenshot, showing the results of the control part's execution is given below. The test case TC has been executed 6 times with different parameters. 3 times execution resulted pass 3 times fail verdict. On the left window at the middle row, the generated log file is shown. Test case results are extracted automatically from it and by clicking on a test case, its log is opened either in a graphical or in a textual/tabular form. In the middle window of the upper row the graphical view the fragment of the last execution of TC can be seen, when the string is received by the PTC and the fail verdict is assigned. By clicking on the "charstring", its content is opening in a value window that can be seen in the window below the graphical log window and at the same time the source code line producing the log event is highlighted in the TTCN-3 editor (rigth window of the middle row). The left window of the top row allows selecting the test cases/control part to be executed and shows the actual status of test components during test case runs.
Why Here?: Eclipse Foundation is a perfect place for the Titan project for the following reasons:
existing Eclipse IDE, code QA, test execution control and result analysis tools.
the Polarsys project targets robust industry-grade toolset, Titan is such a tool and it targets Polarsys
TTCN-3 and Titan is an ideal target language and tool for model based testing. Modeling support and tools exist in Eclipse, but no support for model based testing (MBT). Titan can complement the existing modeling tools to create a complete MBT environment from modeling to test execution and result (log) evaluation. Such project proposal is being submitted by CEA List, with agreement and co-operation from us.

Legal Issues: There is no known legal issues with the Titan and test port code or the TTCN-3 language.
Titan
is currently using the following 3rd Party libraries (prepequisites):
Name of library License
Editline Library (libedit) NetBSD (http://thrysoee.dk/editline/)
GNU C Library (glibc) LGPL (http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html)
LibXML2 MIT (http://xmlsoft.org/index.html)
OpenSSL dual license: OpenSSL and SSLeay (http://www.openssl.org/)
ANTLR BSD (http://www.antlr.org/license.html)
Titan uses the bison and the flex tools in binary form, without any source code modification. The output C parser and lexer files, generated by these tools, are compiled to the Titan executable.
Name of the tool License
GNU Bison GPL for the tool's code, but as a special exception, generated files can be used even in non-free products
(http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Conditions)
Flex BSD (http://sourceforge.net/projects/flex/)
Titan is developed for the POSIX environment, but it is possible to use it on Windows platforms on top of cygwin. In this case (but not in the Linux and Solaris versions), it also uses the runtime library libcygwin.a of cygwin.
Name License
Cygwin By default GPLv3+, but cygwin license contains the following exception clause for using it with open source
SW (see https://cygwin.com/licensing.html):
"Cygwin™ Open Source Licensing Exception
As a special exception to GPLv3+, Red Hat grants you permission to link software whose sources are distributed under a license that satisfies the Open Source Definition with libcygwin.a, without libcygwin.a itself causing the resulting program to be covered by GPLv3+.
This means that you can port an Open Source application to Cygwin™, and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of libcygwin.a linked into it. Note that this does not apply to the Cygwin™ DLL itself. If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of the Cygwin™ DLL, you must adhere to the terms of the GPLv3+, including the requirement to provide sources for the Cygwin™ DLL, unless you have obtained a special Cygwin™ license to distribute the Cygwin™ DLL in only its binary form (see below).
See http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/ for the precise Open Source Definition referenced above."

the Polarsys project targets robust industry-grade toolset, Titan is such a tool and it targets Polarsys
TTCN-3 and Titan is an ideal target language and tool for model based testing. Modeling support and tools exist in Eclipse, but no support for model based testing (MBT). Titan can complement the existing modeling tools to create a complete MBT environment from modeling to test execution and result (log) evaluation. Such project proposal is being submitted by CEA List, with agreement and co-operation from us.
Cygwin itself will not be delivered with Titan and will not be kept in the Titan project's repository (with the possible exception of libcygwin.a). It will be the users' responsibility to install the correct version of cygwin, including Cygwin™ DLL, if Titan is used on machines running Windows OS. Therefore this arrangement will fulfill the preconditions of the above exception.
It is possible to build a limited-capability native Windows version of the Titan compiler and xsd2ttcn converter. This version provides syntax and semantic checks of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 sources and converting XSD documents to TTCN-3 modules only, but doesn't generate C++ code. Standardization bodies, as 3GPP, like to use this version, as they are developing the code but do not execute the test cases themselves, and many people are using Windows (test cases are verified by members on real implementations and issues found in the test cases are reported back as change requests). In this version of Titan the MINGW 3rd Party library is used:
Name License
MINGW MIT-style (see http://www.mingw.org/licensel)
All other code in Titan has been developed by Ericsson from the very beginning.
Titan's help within Eclipse Help contain several links to different external resources (download site of command line components, trouble reporting. links to TTCN-3, ASN.1 and XSD standards etc.). These links will be replaced by their public equivalences when the project is provisioned and the public sites are established. This links require any browser be installed to be able to open the given page, i.e. this forms a works-with dependency.
"Titan" is a well-known name of the toolset within Ericsson. However, in case the name "Titan" is not acceptable, we have the alternative name proposals:
- Tit@n, Tit@nium
- TiT3an, TiT3anium ("3" is not pronounced)
- T3itan, T3itanium ("3" is not pronounced)
TTCN-3
We hold the following statement from ETSI:
"ETSI has no duty to conduct any research with respect to IPRs encumbering the standards developed by ETSI.
As of June 23rd 2014, ETSI can hereby represent that no ESSENTIAL IPRs as defined in the ETSI IPR policy, have been declared by any ETSI Member in relation with the TTCN-3 standard developed by ETSI.
To the best of ETSI knowledge and as of June 23th 2014, ETSI is not aware of any third parties IPRs which could encumber TTCN 3 and which have not been declared.
ETSI owns no IPR on the TTCN 3 standard."
Test Ports
Some test ports uses 3rd Party libraries as tools as below.
All test ports supporting TCP communication (TCP, HTTP,are using Open SSL. Licensing of Open SLL see at the Titan clause above.
SIP and SQL
They use the Bison and Flex as 3rd Party tools. The test port itself includes the output C parser and lexer files, generated by these tools, which are compiled into the executable test suite (the HC). Licensing conditions see at the Titan clause above.
SQL
The SQL test port also uses the SQLite library (the sqlite3 development library)

Licenses: Eclipse Public License 1.0Project Scheduling: The initial contribution is already available. It will be contributed as soon as the project creation process is finished successfully.
Future Work: Titan will further be developed in Ericsson and the changed and new code be submitted to this project. Other future developments depend on further contributors to the project and their needs.
In parallel with this project proposal, a related project is being proposed by CEA List of the topic "Model based formal verification and validation". These two proposals are complementing each other with the aim to create a complete model-based-testing environment, from model specification to test generation, test execution and test result analysis. In the current stage the test cases generated from the model can be integrated with TTCN-3 based test harnesses and be executed using Titan. This will require aligning the code generator's output with the test harness interfaces and/or APIs manually. The two tools are seen by the user as two separate tools currently. We plan closer integration later, but at the point time details are not yet known as the technical discussions are still ahead of us.
We are planning to take several actions to build the community. We plan to announce open sourcing Titan and promote it at the UCAAT and HUSTEF conferences in September-October 2014. We plan to create a flyer, public website, newsletter and introduction video. Also we are planning to disseminate information about open source Titan in the traditional TTCN-3 community places as the ttcn-3.org website, the TTCN-3 article in Wikipedia, LinkedIn etc. Of course, Eplipse conferences, like EclipseCon Europe 2014, are the natural places to share information and build community. Eclipse Foundation's advice and involvement are welcome.

ctags for TTCN-3 / vim? By: Harald Welte on Tue, 03 March 2020

See http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/ for the precise Open Source Definition referenced above."
Cygwin itself will not be delivered with Titan and will not be kept in the Titan project's repository (with the possible exception of libcygwin.a). It will be the users' responsibility to install the correct version of cygwin, including Cygwin™ DLL, if Titan is used on machines running Windows OS. Therefore this arrangement will fulfill the preconditions of the above exception.
It is possible to build a limited-capability native Windows version of the Titan compiler and xsd2ttcn converter. This version provides syntax and semantic checks of TTCN-3 and ASN.1 sources and converting XSD documents to TTCN-3 modules only, but doesn't generate C++ code. Standardization bodies, as 3GPP, like to use this version, as they are developing the code but do not execute the test cases themselves, and many people are using Windows (test cases are verified by members on real implementations and issues found in the test cases are reported back as change requests). In this version of Titan the MINGW 3rd Party library is used:
Name License
MINGW MIT-style (see http://www.mingw.org/licensel)
All other code in Titan has been developed by Ericsson from the very beginning.
Titan's help within Eclipse Help contain several links to different external resources (download site of command line components, trouble reporting. links to TTCN-3, ASN.1 and XSD standards etc.). These links will be replaced by their public equivalences when the project is provisioned and the public sites are established. This links require any browser be installed to be able to open the given page, i.e. this forms a works-with dependency.
"Titan" is a well-known name of the toolset within Ericsson. However, in case the name "Titan" is not acceptable, we have the alternative name proposals:
- Tit@n, Tit@nium
- TiT3an, TiT3anium ("3" is not pronounced)
- T3itan, T3itanium ("3" is not pronounced)
TTCN-3
We hold the following statement from ETSI:
"ETSI has no duty to conduct any research with respect to IPRs encumbering the standards developed by ETSI.
As of June 23rd 2014, ETSI can hereby represent that no ESSENTIAL IPRs as defined in the ETSI IPR policy, have been declared by any ETSI Member in relation with the TTCN-3 standard developed by ETSI.
To the best of ETSI knowledge and as of June 23th 2014, ETSI is not aware of any third parties IPRs which could encumber TTCN 3 and which have not been declared.
ETSI owns no IPR on the TTCN 3 standard."
Test Ports
Some test ports uses 3rd Party libraries as tools as below.
All test ports supporting TCP communication (TCP, HTTP,are using Open SSL. Licensing of Open SLL see at the Titan clause above.
SIP and SQL

They use the Bison and Flex as 3rd Party tools. The test port itself includes the output C parser and lexer files, generated by these tools, which are compiled into the executable test suite (the HC). Licensing conditions see at the Titan clause above.
SQL
The SQL test port also uses the SQLite library (the sqlite3 development library)
Name of library License
SQLite Public domain (http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html)
LANL2 and PCAP
These test ports are using the PCAP (libpcap) 3rd Party library (used also by TCPDump, Wireshark, etc.)
Name of library License
libpcap BSD 3-Clause (http://www.tcpdump.org/license.html)
Project Scheduling: The initial contribution is already available. It will be contributed as soon as the project creation process is finished successfully.
Future Work: Titan will further be developed in Ericsson and the changed and new code be submitted to this project. Other future developments depend on further contributors to the project and their needs.
In parallel with this project proposal, a related project is being proposed by CEA List of the topic "Model based formal verification and validation". These two proposals are complementing each other with the aim to create a complete model-based-testing environment, from model specification to test generation, test execution and test result analysis. In the current stage the test cases generated from the model can be integrated with TTCN-3 based test harnesses and be executed using Titan. This will require aligning the code generator's output with the test harness interfaces and/or APIs manually. The two tools are seen by the user as two separate tools currently. We plan closer integration later, but at the point time details are not yet known as the technical discussions are still ahead of us.
We are planning to take several actions to build the community. We plan to announce open sourcing Titan and promote it at the UCAAT and HUSTEF conferences in September-October 2014. We plan to create a flyer, public website, newsletter and introduction video. Also we are planning to disseminate information about open source Titan in the traditional TTCN-3 community places as the ttcn-3.org website, the TTCN-3 article in Wikipedia, LinkedIn etc. Of course, Eplipse conferences, like EclipseCon Europe 2014, are the natural places to share information and build community. Eclipse Foundation's advice and involvement are welcome.
People
Project Leads: Gyorgy RethyElemer LelikCommitters: Elemér LelikGábor SzalaiKristóf SzabadosGyörgy RéthyMentors: Marc KhouzamInterested Parties: - Concordia University, Montrèal: interested as user, adaptor and most probably contributors.
- CEA is interested to use Titan in a model based testing scenario. We plan to start discussion on possible roadmaps to create an integrated toolchain for model based testing using Papyrus, Titan and other open source tools.
- Thales is interested as user/adaptor.
- Eötvös Lóránd University, Budapest: they are contributors already today by contributing to the development of the Titanium plugin.
- Budapest University of Technology and Economics: they are interested as users and adaptors: Titan is being used for several years in their university course (TTCN-3 is a lab measurement topic)
Discussion with further potentially interested parties are ongoing.Further interested parties will be added during the review process.
