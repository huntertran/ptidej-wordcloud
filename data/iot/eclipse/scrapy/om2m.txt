Application resources
Open the IN-CSE web interface, and move to the MN-CSE resource tree. You will find the following resources:
"LAMP_0": an AE resource enables to handle lamp 0.
"LAMP_1": an AE resource enables to handle lamp 1.
"LAMP_ALL": is an AE resource enables to handle simultaneously lamp 0 and lamp 1.
Web interface: The "applications" resource
Container resources
Click on the "LAMP_0" application resource. You will find two containers:
"DESCRIPTOR" stores the lamp description.
"DATA" stores the lamp data.
Web interface: The "containers" resource
ContentInstances resources
Click on the "DESCRIPTOR" container. You will find one contentInstance containing "LAMP_0" description.
Web interface: The "contetnInstances" resource
Click on the contentInstance (CI974727193 in this example)

Two general questions: Managing library dependencies and referencing local directories By: Klemen Petrovcic on Wed, 13 July 2016
Uncheck the Create a plug-in using one of the templates checkbook and press the Finish button.
create a plug-in project: step 3
As result the following project is created.
sample ipe plug-in
Convert the plugin into maven project
Open the build.properties file and update the src attributes as depicted in the following figure.
build-properties build
Note: At the end of the tutorial, you may face this error: gogo: BundleException: Error loading bundle activator. when starting the IPE. If this is the case, replacing src/main/java by the default src/ might do the trick.
Select the created plug-in "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" → right click → configure → convert to maven project.
Enter the data as illustrated in the following and press the Finish button.
maven conversion: POM edition
Once the plug-in is converted, open the pom.xml file to edit the parent filed.
Click on "select Parent" icon and enter "org.eclipse.om2m" in the "Enter groupId, artifactId or sh1 prefix or pattern" field.
Select "org.om2m.eclipse" and press ok.
maven conversion: Parent edition
We end this step by updating the plug-in project. For this, select the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" project → maven → update project.
Add the plugin as a maven module to the OM2M parent project
In this part, we will add the created plug-in as a module to the om2m platform:
Open the pom file of the org.eclipse.om2m package.
Go to the modules tab and press Add button.
Select the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in and press ok.
Build the om2m package and its sub-projects. To do this, select the "org.eclipse.om2m" project → right click → Run as → maven install.
Check the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe was successfully built. At the buid end, we should get this result.
om2m build
Update your project: Select the package "org.eclipse.om2m" -> right click -> maven -> update Project.
Clone OM2M using Eclipse
Select Window->Show View -> Other .
In the dialog box, select the Git view.
Click on “Clone a Git repository”.
Git clone
Clone the OM2M project using the following link: http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.git. In the first page, enter the mentioned link in the URI’s location field. Click Next . Git clone
In the second page, keep the “master” branch checkbox selected and click Next.
Git clone
In the third page, check the “import all existing projects after clone finishes” and click “Finish”.
Git clone
The OM2M project is now cloned and is visible on the Git repositories’ and Package’ explorers.
If you still have an error on Tycho plugin lifecycle, check that you have downloaded the right Eclipse version (RCP and RAP Developers)
Build OM2M using Eclipse
Select “org.eclipse.om2m” package and right click. Select “Run as -> maven install”.
Two Eclipse products will be generated after a successful built:
The IN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
The MN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse/target/products/mn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
The ASN product can be found on this directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.asn-cse/target/products/asn-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>"
Test OM2M
Go to the IN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>".
Start the IN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on Windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.

Remark: To keep the same display pattern for all the platform' plugins, you can add description and name tags to the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe' pom.xml file.
<project>
......
<name>org.eclipse.om2m :: sample ipe</name>
<description>org.eclipse.om2m :: sample ipe</description>
.....
</project>
Add the plugin to the OM2M product(s)
The final step consists of adding the created plug-in to one of om2m platform products, i.e the mn-cse or the in-cse executable. In the following, we choose to add the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in to the mn-cse product:
Select the org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse package.
Open the om2m.product file.
Go in the "Contents" tab.
Press "Add" button and type: org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe
Click on "Ok" button and save.
Build the om2m package and its sub-projects: select the "org.eclipse.om2m" package -> right click -> Run as -> maven install.
To check that the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" was successfully added to the mn-cse product, run the mn-cse and verify in the console if the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" is displayed.
mn-cse product
Add required dependencies
Add plugin dependencies
Open the manifest file of the created plugin and select Dependencies tab.
Add the dependencies depicted in the following figure.
Important! You need to import om2m nested projects into your workspace to find them in the list below.
plugin dependencies
WARNING for Windows users: don't double click on the "start.bat" file from Eclipse explorer on Windows. This cause unwanted loading of bundles and the platform will NOT be launched. Use the File Explorer instead.
Once the IN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles. Type "exit" to shutdown.
IN-CSE OSGi console
Open your browser and connect to the address "http://127.0.0.1:8080/webpage" to access the IN-CSE web interface.
Enter username "admin" and password "admin" then click on login button to display the IN-CSE resource tree.
IN-CSE web interface: authentication
After a successful authentication, the in-cse resource will be displayed. You can see the "in-cse" CseBase sub-resources and attributes.
IN-CSE web interface: in-cse cseBase resource
Congratulation!! You built and started OM2M successfully.

Develop an Interworking Proxy application Entity (IPE) plugin
IPE Activator
The Activator class contains the implementation of the start() and stop() method used to activate and deactivate the IPE plugin.
In the start() method, the Activator registers the IPE Controller service on the registry to make it available for the CORE plugin. Then, it starts tracking the CORE CSE service to use it once the CORE plugin is activated.
In the Stop() method, the Activator can execute some process to make a clean before deactivation such as stopping threads, handle exceptions, etc. In our case, we stop the Monitor that have a set of thread that must be handled.

Startup
IN-CSE startup
Go to the IN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse/target/products/in-cse/<os>/<ws>/<arch>".
Start the IN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
Once the IN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles. Type "exit" to shutdown.
IN-CSE OSGi console
Open your browser and connect to the address "http://127.0.0.1:8080/webpage" to access the IN-CSE web interface.
Enter username "admin" and password "admin" then click on login button to display the IN-CSE resource tree.
IN-CSE web interface: authentication
After a successful authentication, the IN-CSE resource will be displayed. You can see the "in-cse" cseBase sub-resources and attributes.
You can disconnect by clicking on the "Logout" button.
IN-CSE web interface: in-cse cseBase resource
MN-CSE startup
Go to the MN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse/target/products/mn-cse/<os>/<ws>/arch>".
Start the MN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
Once the MN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles.
The MN-CSE automatically authenticate to the remote IN-CSE specified in the gateway configuration file. If the IN-CSE is not already running, the MN-CSE keep sending authentication requests (A request each 10 seconds).
After a successful authentication, the “mn-cse” resource is added to the in-cse resource tree, and respectively the “in-cse” resource is added to the mn-cse resource tree. You can now access the registered MN-CSE resource from the IN-CSE web interface under the “/in-cse/in-name/mn-cse” uri.
Using the In-CSE web interface you can seamlessly access to all authenticated gateways. You notice the existence of one authenticated MN-CSE with id "mn-cse".
Click on the "mn-cse" resource to display remote MN-CSE sub-resources and attributes. You can click on the “mn-cse” button of the “link” attribute to connect to the MN-CSE resources tree.
IN-CSE web interface: remote mn-cse resource
The MN-CSE resource tree will be displayed. At this moment, the IN-CSE will act as a proxy to retarget your requests to the MN-CSE.

The Monitor class creates one sensor AE called "MY_SENSOR", and one actuator AE called "MY_ACTUATOR". It creates two containers for each applications: "DESCRIPTOR" container to store the description and "DATA" container to store the measurements. For each container the right oBIX XML payload is created as contentInstance.
The Monitor starts two threads to listen to each application data as well. Once a new data is detected, the Monitor creates a new contentInstance including the measurement representation.
Another method is available to stop the monitor and linked threads.

Create a data contentInstance
Send a HTTP request with the following parameters to create a data content instance resource under the "DATA" container.
Field

URL
http://127.0.0.1:8080/~/in-cse/in-name/MY_SENSOR/DATA

Initially, also the MN-CSE contains the CseBase resource (id=mn-cse), the AccessRight resource (id=acp_admin), and other empty collections.
Multiple gateways scenario
Let's consider a simple M2M system composed of a server and two gateways as follows:
Server IP: 192.168.0.2
Gateway1 IP: 192.168.0.3
Gateway2 IP: 192.168.0.4
Of course, you can test the system locally in one machine by using the IP 127.0.0.1 for all products.
After building the OM2M project normally, you will obtain 1 IN-CSE product, 1 MN-CSE product and 1 ADN-CSE product.
You can configure the IN-CSE with the default configuration like this:
IN-CSE config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=IN-CSE
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=in-name
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.2
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8080
Now, copy the MN-CSE product in another folder. You have now two separate MN-CSEs.
Configure the first MN-CSE with the following configuration:
MN-CSE1 config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=MN-CSE1
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=mn-name1
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.3
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8181

Check the created content instance on the web interface.
Create a "MY_SENSOR" application using JSON
Since OM2M supports JSON, you can send an HTTP request with the following parameters to create a MY_SENSOR application on the gateway using JSON instead of XML.
Field
Value
URL
http://127.0.0.1:8080/~/in-cse
Method
POST
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseId=IN-CSE
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseName=in-name
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseAddress=192.168.0.2
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCsePort=8080
Then, configure the second MN-CSE with the following configuration:
MN-CSE2 config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=MN-CSE2
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=mn-cse2
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.4
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8282
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseId=IN-CSE
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseName=in-name
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseddress=192.168.0.2
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCsePort=8080
You can start the system as follows:
Start the IN-CSE product.
Start the MN-CSE1 product.
Start the MN-CSE2 product.
Open the IN-CSE web interface on http://192.168.0.2:8080/webpage. You will find MN-CSE1 and MN-CSE2 authenticated.
You can access now each authenticated MN-CSE by clicking on the MN-CSE.
Click on the "link" button to access remotely the gateway resource tree.

You can interact with the system in the same way using JSON instead of XML with an equivalent of the XML body. (Be careful for the Labels to use a JSON array for instance: "lbl":"["label-1", "label-2"].)
Subscribe to MY_SENSOR data
Download the monitor server sample from this link: Monitor.
Start the Monitor server using the following command:
> java -jar monitor.jar
The monitor starts listening on port=1400 and context=/monitor.
Monitor console: the server is started
Send a HTTP request with the following parameters to create a "Subscription" resource for receive asynchronously events from "MY_SENSOR" application.
The monitor listening URL (http://127.0.0.1:1400/monitor) should be added on the "nu" tag of the subscription representation.

API Specification for Smart Home - JONES Initiative
The goal of the JONES Initiative is to define and develop a Cloud API for Home Automation. The JONES Cloud API enables applications to integrate remote user devices and data from JONES compliant Smart Home platforms.
Today the JONES Initiative partners are Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Nevertheless, the JONES Initiative is open for further, future partners.
To define, develop, and evangelize the JONES Cloud API it is paramount to have a common reference architecture as well as a common reference implementation. This reference implementation is developed on OM2M open source project.
NODE-RED nodes for OM2M
Based on Node-RED, node-red-contrib-ide-iot is a module that allows the creation of IoT applications graphically in a simple and efficient way. It uses the OM2M platform as a middleware that provides high level interoperability between the different heterogeneous objects connected to this platform. node-red-contrib-ide-iot modules allow to be connected to several OM2M platforms, manages resources, extract data from sensors in a different ways, manage activators and communicate in a different way. You can download those modules on: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ide-iot and get documentation on https://homepages.laas.fr/monteil/drupal/content/node-red-ideom2m and http://cwt.nctu.edu.tw/node-red-ideom2m/ . Those modules have been developed and supported by LAAS-CNRS https://www.laas.fr/public/en and National Chiao Tung University http://www.nctu.edu.tw/en .

NEW: This page covers the oneM2M version of OM2M. If you are looking for documentation for the smartM2M version (v0.8.x) click here.
OM2M provides an open source service platform for M2M interoperability based on the oneM2M standard. OM2M follows a RESTful approach with open interfaces to enable developing services and applications independently of the underlying network. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It supports multiple protocol bindings such as HTTP and CoAP. Various interworking proxies are provided to enable seamless communication with vendor-specific technologies such as Zigbee and Phidgets devices.

Note: At the end of the tutorial, you may face this error: gogo: BundleException: Error loading bundle activator. when starting the IPE. If this is the case, replacing src/main/java by the default src/ might do the trick.
Select the created plug-in "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" → right click → configure → convert to maven project.
Enter the data as illustrated in the following and press the Finish button.
maven conversion: POM edition
Once the plug-in is converted, open the pom.xml file to edit the parent filed.
Click on "select Parent" icon and enter "org.eclipse.om2m" in the "Enter groupId, artifactId or sh1 prefix or pattern" field.
Select "org.om2m.eclipse" and press ok.

Introduction
OM2M provides a RESTful API for creating and managing M2M resources. It includes several primitive procedures to enable machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, re-targeting, etc.
This API operates on the following primary resource types:
CseBase: describes the hosting CSE, and is the root for all other resources within the hosting CSE.
remoteCse: stores information related to M2M CSEs residing on other M2M machines after successful mutual authentication. It enables Cses interactions using retargeting operations
AE: stores information about the Application Entity after a successful registration on the hosting CSE.
Container: acts as a mediator for data buffering to enable data exchange between applications and CSEs
AccessControlPolicies: manages permissions and permissions holders to limit and protect the access to the resource tree structure.
Group: enhances resources tree operations and simplifying the interactions on the API interfaces by adding the grouping feature. It enables an issuer to send one request to a set of receivers instead of sending requests one by one.
Subscription: stores information related to subscriptions for some resources. It allow subscribers to receive asynchronous notification when an event happens such as the reception of new sensor event or the creation, update, or delete of a resource.
Prerequisites
"JAVA 1.8" is required to run OM2M.
"Apache Maven 3" is required to build OM2M.

Select the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in and press ok.
Build the om2m package and its sub-projects. To do this, select the "org.eclipse.om2m" project → right click → Run as → maven install.
Check the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe was successfully built. At the buid end, we should get this result.
om2m build
Remark: To keep the same display pattern for all the platform' plugins, you can add description and name tags to the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe' pom.xml file.
<project>
......
<name>org.eclipse.om2m :: sample ipe</name>
<description>org.eclipse.om2m :: sample ipe</description>
.....
</project>
Add the plugin to the OM2M product(s)
The final step consists of adding the created plug-in to one of om2m platform products, i.e the mn-cse or the in-cse executable. In the following, we choose to add the org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe plug-in to the mn-cse product:
Select the org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse package.
Open the om2m.product file.
Go in the "Contents" tab.
Press "Add" button and type: org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe
Click on "Ok" button and save.
Build the om2m package and its sub-projects: select the "org.eclipse.om2m" package -> right click -> Run as -> maven install.
To check that the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" was successfully added to the mn-cse product, run the mn-cse and verify in the console if the "org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe" is displayed.

Add the dependencies depicted in the following figure.
Important! You need to import om2m nested projects into your workspace to find them in the list below.
plugin dependencies
Add jar dependencies (Only if required)
If you want to add specific jar libraries to your plugin, you can follow these steps:
Create a "libs" folder on your plugin project.
Put required specific jar on the "libs" folder.
Open the manifest file of the created plugin and select "runtime" tab.
Go to the "classpath" tab and click on the "Add" button.
Select the required jar and click on "ok" button.
plugin specific jar dependencies
Develop an Interworking Proxy application Entity (IPE) plugin
IPE Activator
The Activator class contains the implementation of the start() and stop() method used to activate and deactivate the IPE plugin.
In the start() method, the Activator registers the IPE Controller service on the registry to make it available for the CORE plugin. Then, it starts tracking the CORE CSE service to use it once the CORE plugin is activated.
In the Stop() method, the Activator can execute some process to make a clean before deactivation such as stopping threads, handle exceptions, etc. In our case, we stop the Monitor that have a set of thread that must be handled.

API Specification for Smart Home - JONES Initiative
The goal of the JONES Initiative is to define and develop a Cloud API for Home Automation. The JONES Cloud API enables applications to integrate remote user devices and data from JONES compliant Smart Home platforms.
Today the JONES Initiative partners are Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Nevertheless, the JONES Initiative is open for further, future partners.
To define, develop, and evangelize the JONES Cloud API it is paramount to have a common reference architecture as well as a common reference implementation. This reference implementation is developed on OM2M open source project.
NODE-RED nodes for OM2M
Based on Node-RED, node-red-contrib-ide-iot is a module that allows the creation of IoT applications graphically in a simple and efficient way. It uses the OM2M platform as a middleware that provides high level interoperability between the different heterogeneous objects connected to this platform. node-red-contrib-ide-iot modules allow to be connected to several OM2M platforms, manages resources, extract data from sensors in a different ways, manage activators and communicate in a different way. You can download those modules on: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ide-iot and get documentation on https://homepages.laas.fr/monteil/drupal/content/node-red-ideom2m and http://cwt.nctu.edu.tw/node-red-ideom2m/ . Those modules have been developed and supported by LAAS-CNRS https://www.laas.fr/public/en and National Chiao Tung University http://www.nctu.edu.tw/en .

IPE Monitor
The Monitor class creates one sensor AE called "MY_SENSOR", and one actuator AE called "MY_ACTUATOR". It creates two containers for each applications: "DESCRIPTOR" container to store the description and "DATA" container to store the measurements. For each container the right oBIX XML payload is created as contentInstance.

The Monitor starts two threads to listen to each application data as well. Once a new data is detected, the Monitor creates a new contentInstance including the measurement representation.
Another method is available to stop the monitor and linked threads.

NEW: This page covers the oneM2M version of OM2M. If you are looking for documentation for the smartM2M version (v0.8.x) click here.
OM2M provides an open source service platform for M2M interoperability based on the oneM2M standard. OM2M follows a RESTful approach with open interfaces to enable developing services and applications independently of the underlying network. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It supports multiple protocol bindings such as HTTP and CoAP. Various interworking proxies are provided to enable seamless communication with vendor-specific technologies such as Zigbee and Phidgets devices.

Introduction
OM2M provides a RESTful API for creating and managing M2M resources. It includes several primitive procedures to enable machines authentication, resources discovery, applications registration, containers management, synchronous and asynchronous communications, access rights authorization, groups organisation, re-targeting, etc.
This API operates on the following primary resource types:
CseBase: describes the hosting CSE, and is the root for all other resources within the hosting CSE.
remoteCse: stores information related to M2M CSEs residing on other M2M machines after successful mutual authentication. It enables Cses interactions using retargeting operations
AE: stores information about the Application Entity after a successful registration on the hosting CSE.
Container: acts as a mediator for data buffering to enable data exchange between applications and CSEs
AccessControlPolicies: manages permissions and permissions holders to limit and protect the access to the resource tree structure.
Group: enhances resources tree operations and simplifying the interactions on the API interfaces by adding the grouping feature. It enables an issuer to send one request to a set of receivers instead of sending requests one by one.
Subscription: stores information related to subscriptions for some resources. It allow subscribers to receive asynchronous notification when an event happens such as the reception of new sensor event or the creation, update, or delete of a resource.
Prerequisites
"JAVA 1.8" is required to run OM2M.
"Apache Maven 3" is required to build OM2M.

Enter username "admin" and password "admin" then click on login button to display the IN-CSE resource tree.
IN-CSE web interface: authentication
After a successful authentication, the IN-CSE resource will be displayed. You can see the "in-cse" cseBase sub-resources and attributes.
You can disconnect by clicking on the "Logout" button.
IN-CSE web interface: in-cse cseBase resource
MN-CSE startup
Go to the MN-CSE product directory: "om2m/org.eclipse.om2m/org.eclipse.om2m.site.mn-cse/target/products/mn-cse/<os>/<ws>/arch>".
Start the MN-CSE by executing the "start.bat" script on windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
Once the MN-CSE is started, you will see an OSGi console. You can type “ss” to report a summary status of all installed bundles.
The MN-CSE automatically authenticate to the remote IN-CSE specified in the gateway configuration file. If the IN-CSE is not already running, the MN-CSE keep sending authentication requests (A request each 10 seconds).
After a successful authentication, the “mn-cse” resource is added to the in-cse resource tree, and respectively the “in-cse” resource is added to the mn-cse resource tree. You can now access the registered MN-CSE resource from the IN-CSE web interface under the “/in-cse/in-name/mn-cse” uri.
Using the In-CSE web interface you can seamlessly access to all authenticated gateways. You notice the existence of one authenticated MN-CSE with id "mn-cse".
Click on the "mn-cse" resource to display remote MN-CSE sub-resources and attributes. You can click on the “mn-cse” button of the “link” attribute to connect to the MN-CSE resources tree.
IN-CSE web interface: remote mn-cse resource
The MN-CSE resource tree will be displayed. At this moment, the IN-CSE will act as a proxy to retarget your requests to the MN-CSE.
IN-CSE web interface: mn-cse cseBase resource
Initially, also the MN-CSE contains the CseBase resource (id=mn-cse), the AccessRight resource (id=acp_admin), and other empty collections.
Multiple gateways scenario
Let's consider a simple M2M system composed of a server and two gateways as follows:
Server IP: 192.168.0.2
Gateway1 IP: 192.168.0.3
Gateway2 IP: 192.168.0.4
Of course, you can test the system locally in one machine by using the IP 127.0.0.1 for all products.

After building the OM2M project normally, you will obtain 1 IN-CSE product, 1 MN-CSE product and 1 ADN-CSE product.
You can configure the IN-CSE with the default configuration like this:
IN-CSE config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=IN-CSE
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=in-name
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.2
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8080
Now, copy the MN-CSE product in another folder. You have now two separate MN-CSEs.
Configure the first MN-CSE with the following configuration:
MN-CSE1 config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=MN-CSE1
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=mn-name1
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.3
org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.http.port=8181
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseId=IN-CSE
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseName=in-name
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCseAddress=192.168.0.2
org.eclipse.om2m.remoteCsePort=8080
Then, configure the second MN-CSE with the following configuration:
MN-CSE2 config.ini file:
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseId=MN-CSE2
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseName=mn-cse2
org.eclipse.om2m.cseBaseAddress=192.168.0.4

Node-RED for OM2M: node-red-contrib-ide-iot
IDE-OM2M: a framework for developing IoT applications using the OM2M platform
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ide-iot)
This page gives examples and tutorial to use the Node-RED nodes for OM2M. Those nodes have been developped in a cooperation betweeen LAAS-CNRS (France) and National Chiao Tung University (Taiwan).
NCTU team:
contact: Fuchun Joseph Lin - fjlin@nctu.edu.tw
Jose De La Bastida - josedelabastida@hotmail.com

A) Installation
Before installing Node-RED, you must have a working installation of Node.js. We recommend you to use the version LTS 8.x of Node.js available at this address: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Once the installation of Node.js has finished, we will proceed with the installation of Node-RED. The easiest way is to use the node package manager ‘npm’ that comes with Node.js as follows:
npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
PS: To use it as a global module, add the command node-red to your system path. After the installation of Node-RED, you can run it using the command:
node-red
Now, you can access to the Node-RED editor by pointing your browser at the address: http://localhost:1880 .
B) Node-RED
Node-RED provides a feed editor that consists of basically three panels:
Flow Panel: This is the main workspace of the user, where he can create his streams by dragging and dropping nodes from the Node Panel.
Information and Debug Panel: It consists of two tabs:
A debug tab: which allows the users to view the results and outputs of deployed flows and errors encountered during execution.
To create an application streams, the user slips the desired node from the node palette and places it into the workspace. Once he has done with all the required nodes, he has to connect them with arcs to constitute the application.
C) Integration of node-red-contrib-ide-iot in Node-RED
1. Get and download the module node-red-contrib-ide-iot, then integrate it in Node-RED by using the npm link command. This allows you to link it into a local node-red install. In the directory containing the node’s package.json file, and run:
sudo npm link
In your node-red user directory, typically ~/.node-red, run the following command:
npm link node-red-contrib-ide-iot
This will create the appropriate symbolic links between the two directories, so Node-RED will discover the node at start-time. Any changes in the node’s file can be picked up by simplyrestarting Node-RED.
2. As node-red-contrib-ide-iot is published in npm, we can directly use the following command to integrate it into Node-RED:

To enter the parameters (URL, login, password) describing the OM2M platform solicited in a global way. If earlier configurations have been specified, the user can select one of them directly.
NamedSensor:
To retrieve the measurements produced by a sensor or the the device state using the exact name of the resource representing that sensor.
Example: retrieve the last data instance of LAMP_0 lamp by creating a flow as mentioned below:
Platform: Select the OM2M platform that you want to use
SensorName: the requested sensor name.
ContentInstance: to choose the instance of data to recover (Latest or Oldest)
Name: to name its node in the graphical interface to avoid any ambiguity when using multiple NamedSensor nodes.
The nodes Inject and Debug are already existing nodes in Node-RED, the first node is used to launch our use case and the other to display the result returned by our stream.After connecting all the nodes of our flow, it will be deployed thanks to the Deploy button. Data instance returned :
LabeledSensor: To recover the data produced by a sensor using a dynamic list of labels (keywords).
Example: retrieve the last data instance of the lamp described by the keywords: Type/actuator Category/luminosity Location/home by creating a flow as mentioned below:
Platform: in our case, we use the same platform used previously, so we only have to select the name OM2M_1 that we chose to give to our platform.

ContentInstance: to choose the instance of data to recover (Latest or Oldest)
LabeledName: to introduce the list of labels describing the device to use. The user can delete a given label via add new labels using using add button.
Data instance returned:
SemanticSensor: retrieve a data instance produced by a sensor using semantics via an SPARQL query request.Example: retrieve the last data instance produced by a Phidget presence sensor. This node only work with Semantic LAAS-CNRS version of OM2M.
Result :
DataExtractor: After receiving a data instance returned by a sensor node (NamedSensor, LabeledSensor, SemanticSensor or NotificationsHandler), the user can retrieve the value of a useful value of this instance using this node.
Example: extract the state of the lamp LAMP_0 from the data instance returned by LabeledSensor.
The user can choose one of the properties:
State: state of a given device;
Data: measure retrieved;
Other: to be indicated by the user;
JPath: in the case of a complicated data instance, the user can use the JPath option to introducethe property path via JSONPath.
Result : the lamp is off.
NotificationsHandler: This node acts as an HTTP server to receive notifications regarding the different resources to which the user has subscribed once a new data instance is created.
Example: receive notifications whenever the LAMP_0 lamp status changes. A SUBSCRIPTION resource must be created under the DATA container of LAMP_0.
The flow created in Node-RED:
And to launch its server, the user clicks the right node button as follows:
After launching the server, create the SUBSCRIPTION resource with the following parameters:

<nct>2</nct> </m2m:sub>
After the subscription, the lamp LAMP_0 is switched on to receive a notification
The received notification:
SimpleCondition: This node aims to test the validity of a simple condition.
Example: test if the lamp LAMP_O is On.
Result:
NamedActuator: It’s used to send a simple command to an actuator using the exact name ofthe resource that describes it and to act on the state of a device or change the properties of the user's environment.Example : turn off the lamp LAMP_0
Platform: edit the parameters of the OM2M platform to use or directly select an already existing OM2M_1 as previously configured.
ActuatorName: the name of the solicited actuator.
Command: the command to send to the actuator.
Name: to name its node in the GUI to avoid ambiguity when using multiple NamedActuator nodes.
Result: LAMP_0 is Off
LabeledActuator: It’s used to send a simple command to an actuator using a dynamic list oflabels that describes it. You have to enter the list of labels and the command to send.
SemanticActuator: use to control a sensor described by a simple SPARQL query. This node only work with Semantic LAAS-CNRS version of OM2M.
E) Use case 1
1: allows to light the lamp LAMP_1 and to send a mail if a presence is detected and the lamp LAMP_0 is extinguished. This shows that IDE-OM2M nodes can work with other existing nodes in Node-RED.

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting way. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using a wide range of nodes, available in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.
Contents:
A) Installation
B) Node-RED
C) Integration of node-red-contrib-ide-iot
D) Nodes
Platform, NamedSensor, LabeledSensor, SemanticSensor, DataExtractor, NotificationHandler, SimpleCondition, NamedActuator, LabeledActuator, SementicActuator
E) Use Case 1
F) Use Case 2
Nodes: Application, Container, ContentInstance, NotificationHandler
A) Installation
Before installing Node-RED, you must have a working installation of Node.js. We recommend you to use the version LTS 8.x of Node.js available at this address: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
Once the installation of Node.js has finished, we will proceed with the installation of Node-RED. The easiest way is to use the node package manager ‘npm’ that comes with Node.js as follows:
npm install -g –unsafe-perm node-red
PS: To use it as a global module, add the command node-red to your system path. After the installation of Node-RED, you can run it using the command:
node-red
Now, you can access to the Node-RED editor by pointing your browser at the address: http://localhost:1880 .
B) Node-RED

Node-RED provides a feed editor that consists of basically three panels:
Flow Panel: This is the main workspace of the user, where he can create his streams by dragging and dropping nodes from the Node Panel.
Information and Debug Panel: It consists of two tabs:
A debug tab: which allows the users to view the results and outputs of deployed flows and errors encountered during execution.
To create an application streams, the user slips the desired node from the node palette and places it into the workspace. Once he has done with all the required nodes, he has to connect them with arcs to constitute the application.
C) Integration of node-red-contrib-ide-iot in Node-RED
Get and download the module node-red-contrib-ide-iot, then integrate it in Node-RED by using the npm link command. This allows you to link it into a local node-red install. In the directory containing the node’s package.json file, and run:
sudo npm link
In your node-red user directory, typically ~/.node-red, run the following command:
npm link node-red-contrib-ide-iot
This will create the appropriate symbolic links between the two directories, so Node-RED will discover the node at start-time. Any changes in the node’s file can be picked up by simplyrestarting Node-RED.
As node-red-contrib-ide-iot is published in npm, we can directly use the following command to integrate it into Node-RED:
npm install node-red-contrib-ide-iot
To reproduce these examples, select the JSON given for each, right-mouse Copy and then Import from… clipboard in Node-RED and ctrl-V the content into the text box. Click OK and the three- node flow will appear under the cursor to be parked on the worksheet.
D) Nodes
E) Use Case 1
F) Use case 2
Create a simple AE by using Application, Container, ContentInstance, Subscription, and NotificationHandler nodes.
Application:
Creates an Application resource. You can specify the following attributes:
Platform: Destination CSE.

"rr": "false",
"lbl": ["Type/sensor", "Category/temperature", "Location/home"],
"rn": "MY_SENSOR"
}
}
You can interact with the system in the same way using JSON instead of XML with an equivalent of the XML body. (Be careful for the Labels to use a JSON array for instance: "lbl":"["label-1", "label-2"].)
Subscribe to MY_SENSOR data
Download the monitor server sample from this link: Monitor.
Start the Monitor server using the following command:
> java -jar monitor.jar
The monitor starts listening on port=1400 and context=/monitor.
