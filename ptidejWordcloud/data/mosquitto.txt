“Contribution” means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.

Eclipse Mosquitto provides a lightweight server implementation of the MQTT protocol that is suitable for all situations from full power machines to embedded and low power machines. Sensors and actuators, which are often the sources and destinations of MQTT messages, can be very small and lacking in power. This also applies to the embedded machines to which they are connected, which is where Mosquitto could be run.

Typically, the current implementation of Mosquitto has an executable in the order of 120kB that consumes around 3MB RAM with 1000 clients connected. There have been reports of successful tests with 100,000 connected clients at modest message rates.
As well as accepting connections from MQTT client applications, Mosquitto has a bridge which allows it to connect to other MQTT servers, including other Mosquitto instances. This allows networks of MQTT servers to be constructed, passing MQTT messages from any location in the network to any other, depending on the configuration of the bridges.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

Research Exploitation
The Eclipse Foundation experts enable the research team to create, evolve and maintain open source software projects that capture the results of the research.
The proven processes of the Eclipse Foundation and services for IP management and community building assist the research partners throughout the lifecycle of the research project. They ensure that the open source code can be used at any given time for research or commercial exploitation.

These processes are set out in the Eclipse Foundation governance model, the Eclipse Development Process and the Eclipse IP management practices. In addition, all code is made available under the
Eclipse Public License
, a commercial-friendly Open Source license approved by the Open Source Initiative.
More exploitation opportunities
Exploitation is driven by availability, open governance, quality, and IP cleanliness. Providing the platform under an OSS license such as the
Eclipse Public License
supports these goals very well. Users and adopters can trust the open governance model that provides a level playing field and commercial exploitation under this business-friendly open source license. The Eclipse IP process ensures that the IP created is tracked and properly managed.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

Software engineers spend most of their time learning to understand the software they maintain or depend on (or will depend on). The goal of this learning process is to support decision-making. In this project, we focus on the increasing dependence on open-source software (OSS) over the last years and the decisions related to depending on open-source software. Eclipse CROSSMETER will support the eﬃcient and eﬀective decision-making regarding dependence on OSS projects and components thereof. This entails both decisions on the architecture level (to decide to select and OSS project) and on the code level (to design the use of the OSS project). In particular, CROSSMETER will provide techniques and tools for extracting knowledge from existing open source components, and use such knowledge to properly select and reuse existing software to develop new systems. The activity of the developer will be continuously monitored in order to raise alerts related to the quality of the selected OSS projects and to give suggestions that can reduce the development eﬀort and increase the quality of the ﬁnal software products.

Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

As part of this process, the Foundation organizes member community reviews for projects to ensure consistent interaction between the projects and the broader membership.
The Eclipse community organizes an annual release train that provides a coordinated release of those Eclipse projects which wish to participate. The release train makes it easier for downstream consumers to adopt new releases of the projects because 1) all the projects are available on the same schedule, so you don't have to wait for independent project schedules, and 2) a level of integration testing occurs before the final release to help identify cross-project issues.

A Unique Model for Open Source Development
The Eclipse Foundation has been established to serve the Eclipse open source projects and the Eclipse community. As an independent not-for-profit corporation, the Foundation and the Eclipse governance model ensures no single entity is able to control the strategy, policies or operations of the Eclipse community.
The Foundation is focused on creating an environment for successful open source projects and to promote the adoption of Eclipse technology in commercial and open source solutions. Through services like IP Due Diligence, annual release trains, development community support, and ecosystem development, the Eclipse model of open source development is a unique and proven model for open source development.

A Contribution Questionnaires (CQ) is the main interface between Eclipse committers and the Intellectual Property Management Team. Prior to committing a significant contribution of content to an Eclipse Foundation project, the committer must fill out this questionnaire and submit it to the Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) for approval. In addition to the EMO, the relevant PMC must also provide a technical review and approval of the contribution. Follow the link to find out more about what we mean by "significant contribution". Bug fixes or minor enhancements do not require PMC or EMO approval.
