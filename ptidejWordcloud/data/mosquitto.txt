Eclipse Mosquitto provides a lightweight server implementation of the MQTT protocol that is suitable for all situations from full power machines to embedded and low power machines. Sensors and actuators, which are often the sources and destinations of MQTT messages, can be very small and lacking in power. This also applies to the embedded machines to which they are connected, which is where Mosquitto could be run.
Typically, the current implementation of Mosquitto has an executable in the order of 120kB that consumes around 3MB RAM with 1000 clients connected. There have been reports of successful tests with 100,000 connected clients at modest message rates.
As well as accepting connections from MQTT client applications, Mosquitto has a bridge which allows it to connect to other MQTT servers, including other Mosquitto instances. This allows networks of MQTT servers to be constructed, passing MQTT messages from any location in the network to any other, depending on the configuration of the bridges.

Desktop IDEs
Eclipse is famous for our Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but our C/C++ IDE and PHP IDE are pretty cool too. You can easily combine language support and other features into any of our default packages, and the Eclipse Marketplace allows for virtually unlimited customization and extension.
Download
Cloud IDEs
Develop your software wherever you go. It'll be there, in the cloud, right where you left it. Use your browser to develop with hosted workspaces or install desktop packaging to experience a modern development environment for Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
IDE Platforms
Create the next generation of developer tooling with our extensible platforms. Use your imagination to build services and tools that can be assembled into new IDEs or packages tailored to your identity. We provide multiple platforms to build plug-ins for desktop tools, distributed services used by cloud IDEs, and browser interfaces. You can then publish plug-ins to our Eclipse Marketplace of 1000s.
Eclipse Platform
Tools
Extend the extensible platform.
An impressive collection of tools can be easily installed into your Eclipse desktop IDE, including GUI builders and tools for modeling, charting and reporting, testing, and more.
Marketplace
Customize and extend Eclipse and make it your own.

Open Source: the catalyst among academics, SMEs, and large organizations
Academics bring new innovations that enable better productivity and new processes in large organizations. SMEs industrialize the innovation transferred through open source projects to support a product-based or expertise-based business model.
Research Exploitation
The Eclipse Foundation experts enable the research team to create, evolve and maintain open source software projects that capture the results of the research.
The proven processes of the Eclipse Foundation and services for IP management and community building assist the research partners throughout the lifecycle of the research project. They ensure that the open source code can be used at any given time for research or commercial exploitation.
These processes are set out in the Eclipse Foundation governance model, the Eclipse Development Process and the Eclipse IP management practices. In addition, all code is made available under the
Eclipse Public License
, a commercial-friendly Open Source license approved by the Open Source Initiative.
Get involved in Eclipse projects to help contribute to their success.
We welcome users and adopters as part of the community.

More exploitation opportunities
Exploitation is driven by availability, open governance, quality, and IP cleanliness. Providing the platform under an OSS license such as the
Eclipse Public License
supports these goals very well. Users and adopters can trust the open governance model that provides a level playing field and commercial exploitation under this business-friendly open source license. The Eclipse IP process ensures that the IP created is tracked and properly managed.
Extensibility, sustainability and maturity
In some industries, platforms and tools must be available for a lifecycle of well over 20 years. With the experience of the Eclipse Foundation and the Eclipse ecosystem, it is possible to provide long-term support and design the platform in a way that allows for continuous and open innovation.
Industrial applications require measurable indicators of project maturity. The Eclipse Foundation deploys assessment processes and tools in Polarsys to help members evaluate the maturity of Eclipse projects and to support projects in achieving higher maturity levels.
The Eclipse Foundation Partners in these Projects
AGILE - Eclipse Agail
The Eclipse Agail is a language-agnostic, modular software and hardware gateway framework for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT application execution, trusted data sharing and external Cloud communication.

CROSSMINER - Eclipse Crossmeter
Software engineers spend most of their time learning to understand the software they maintain or depend on (or will depend on). The goal of this learning process is to support decision-making. In this project, we focus on the increasing dependence on open-source software (OSS) over the last years and the decisions related to depending on open-source software. Eclipse CROSSMETER will support the eﬃcient and eﬀective decision-making regarding dependence on OSS projects and components thereof. This entails both decisions on the architecture level (to decide to select and OSS project) and on the code level (to design the use of the OSS project). In particular, CROSSMETER will provide techniques and tools for extracting knowledge from existing open source components, and use such knowledge to properly select and reuse existing software to develop new systems. The activity of the developer will be continuously monitored in order to raise alerts related to the quality of the selected OSS projects and to give suggestions that can reduce the development eﬀort and increase the quality of the ﬁnal software products.

RobMoSys
RobMoSys envisions an integrated approach built on top of the current code-centric robotic platforms, by applying model-driven methods and tools.
RobMoSys will enable the management of the interfaces between different robotics-related domains in an efficient and systematic way according to each system’s needs.
RobMoSys aims to establish Quality-of-Service properties, enabling a composition-oriented approach while preserving modularity.
RobMoSys will drive the non-competitive part of building a professional quality ecosystem by encouraging the community involvement.

Reporting a Security Vulnerability
Vulnerabilities can be reported either via email to the Eclipse Security Team or directly with a project via the Eclipse Foundation's Bugzilla instance.
The general security mailing list address is
security@eclipse.org
. Members of the Eclipse Security Team will receive messages sent to this address. This address should be used only for reporting undisclosed vulnerabilities; regular issue reports and questions unrelated to vulnerabilities in Eclipse software will be ignored. Note that this email address is not encrypted.
The community is also encouraged to report vulnerabilities using the
Eclipse Foundation's Bugzilla instance
. Note that you will require an Eclipse Foundation account to create an issue report, but by doing so you will be able to participate directly in the resolution of the issue.
Report a potential vulnerability now
Issue reports related to vulnerabilities must be marked as "committers-only", either automatically by clicking the provide link, by the reporter, or by a committer during the triage process. Note that issues marked "committers-only" are visible to all Eclipse committers. By default, a "committers-only" issue is also accessible to the reporter and individuals explicitly indicated in the "cc" list.
Disclosure
Disclosure is initially limited to the reporter and all Eclipse Committers, but is expanded to include other individuals, and the general public. The timing and manner of disclosure is governed by the
Eclipse Security Policy
.
Publicly disclosed issues are listed on the
Disclosed Vulnerabilities Page

The Jakarta EE 8 Full Platform, Web Profile specifications and related TCKs have been officially released today (Septemb...
Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (“AGREEMENT”). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS
“Contribution” means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
“Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
“Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.
“Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
Your address, telephone number, and email address;
A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
A description of where the alleged infringing material is located;
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; and
A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

Eclipse Foundation Website Privacy Policy
May 24, 2018
The Eclipse Foundation, Inc. ("Eclipse Foundation", "Us" or "We") is a member-supported not-for-profit foundation which acts as the steward of our open source projects, community, and ecosystem. We are committed to our community members’ rights to privacy. We promise to share transparently all aspects of how Eclipse Foundation projects and websites work in regards to privacy, terms, and personal data, and We are in full support of efforts to ensure your protection online. We only collect your personal data with your consent, and collect only as much as We need to provide you the service you request. For example, We need your personal data to register you to one of our conferences. Each time We collect additional personal data from you We will explain what We collect, why We need it, how We use it, how long We keep it, and how We protect it.
You can withdraw consent anytime. We will respect your wishes.
Personal Information on Eclipse Foundation Websites
As a platform for open source innovation and collaboration, personal information on all Eclipse Foundation websites is either meant to be shared, for example records of your contributions to our open source projects, or protected, such as your name and email address when you subscribe to our newsletter.
Any personal data you share with Us, We protect according to this Privacy policy.
Individual Access to Personal Information
We will respond within 30 days to your requests to have access to your personal information collected by Us. We will promptly correct inaccuracies, as the case may be, and We will delete it and/or anonymize it upon your request. Please contact
privacy@eclipse.org
to make such a request.
Information Security and Quality
We protect the integrity of your personal information with appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as using encryption for transmission of certain forms of information, to help keep it secure, accurate, current, and complete.
Your personal information may be stored in Canada, the European Union and the United States, always with our same high security standards.
One of the primary purposes of the Eclipse Foundation and its websites is to enable collaborative open source software development. Doing so necessarily requires Us to maintain records of authorship related to all contributions. Any personally identifiable information collected by virtue of your contributions will be publicly available on the Internet in unencrypted form and without access restriction.
We also offer services to our community which provide the ability for users of Eclipse software to store data on Eclipse Foundation servers through services including, but not limited to, the User Storage Service and the Automated Error Reporting Initiative. Any data stored through these services will be publicly available on the Internet in unencrypted form and without access restriction. Therefore, you should not use these services to store passwords, any personally identifiable information, any confidential business information, or anything else that you do not want to be generally and publicly available.
Clickstream Data and Cookies
We sometimes collect anonymous information from visits and contributions to Eclipse Foundation websites to help provide better service. For example, We keep track of the domains from which people visit and We also measure visitor activity on Eclipse Foundation websites, but in ways that keep the information anonymous. This anonymous information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." We may use and aggregate this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help Us tailor our websites to better serve Eclipse participants.

Approved Licenses for Non-Code, Example, and Other Content:
The Board of Directors has approved the use of certain licenses for specific types of content on eclipse.org.
Eclipse Foundation Update Manager Agreement:
If you package "downloadable features" to be installed from your web site using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions contained in this agreement.
Eclipse Foundation Specification License:
“Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
“Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

To the extent you submit or otherwise make available to an Eclipse Foundation Specification Project (as that term is defined by the Intellectual Property Policy) any ideas, concepts, methods or other information, you agree that you will not assert, based on such submissions, any intellectual property rights that are essential to any implementation of the submission, against the Eclipse Foundation, its contributors, or its licensees, with respect to any implementation of such Specification (as that term is defined by the Eclipse Foundation Specification Process). To further clarify, such submissions include, but are not limited to, submissions made to any public communications channel such as an email list, forum, or bug report.
To the extent you wish to upload, submit, or otherwise make Non-Code Content (as defined below) available to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site, you may make that material available under the terms and conditions of the EPL or any other license stipulated for that purpose at
www.eclipse.org/legal
. Non-Code Content is Content for which you own or control all rights, and which is not program code intended to be submitted to a Project (or documentation related to such code) and which is not Stored Information. For example, Non-Code Content would include white papers, dissertations, articles or other literary works, power point presentations, encyclopedias, anthologies, wikis, blogs, diagrams, drawings, sketches, photos or other images, audio content, video content and audiovisual materials.
For all other software, information and other material including, without limitation, ideas, concepts, know-how and techniques, uploaded, submitted or otherwise made available to The Eclipse Foundation, the Members, and/or users of this Website, (collectively "Material"), if the paragraphs above are inapplicable, and if the Material is not Stored Information, you grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) a license under either the applicable Project License(s) (as that term is defined in the Eclipse Intellectual Property Policy), or, if no such Project License(s) is applicable, you grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) the Eclipse Foundation, the Members and the users of this Web-site a worldwide, unrestricted, royalty free, fully paid up, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive license to use, make, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, sell, distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer such Materials, and/or derivative works thereof, and authorize third parties to do any, some or all of the foregoing including, but not limited to, sublicensing others to do any some or all of the foregoing indefinitely.

Due Diligence Process:
This document provides a quick pictorial overview of the due diligence process.
Third Party Dependencies:
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
“This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”
Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.
You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

The Eclipse Foundation is a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization supported by over 275
members
who value the Foundation’s unique
Working Group
governance model, open innovation processes, and
community-building events
. Our members include industry leaders who have embraced open source as a
key enabler for business strategy
.
Origins
The
Eclipse Project
was originally created by IBM in November 2001 and supported by a consortium of software vendors. The Eclipse Project continues to be used by millions of developers.
The Eclipse Foundation was created in January 2004 as an independent not-for-profit corporation to act as the steward of the Eclipse community. The independent not-for-profit corporation was created to allow a vendor-neutral, open, and transparent community to be established around Eclipse.
Structure
The Eclipse community consists of individual developers and organizations spanning many industries. The Foundation employs a full-time
professional staff
to provide services to the community. The Eclipse Foundation is funded by annual dues from our
members
and governed by a
Board of Directors
. Strategic Developers and Strategic Consumers hold seats on this Board, as do representatives elected by Add-in Providers and Open Source committers. Eclipse committers are typically employed by organizations or are independent developers that volunteer their time to work on the Eclipse projects.
Services
The Eclipse Foundation provides four key services to the Eclipse community: 1)

Eclipse Modeling Framework (Core)
This document contains the guidelines for the review of third-party dependencies.
Committer Guidelines:
This document outlines the issues to be aware of and the processes one should follow when working as a committer on Eclipse.org projects. A committer is a person that has been granted commit rights to systems on the Eclipse.org servers such as git repositories, web pages, download servers, mailing lists and so forth.
Contribution Questionnaire:
A Contribution Questionnaires (CQ) is the main interface between Eclipse committers and the Intellectual Property Management Team. Prior to committing a significant contribution of content to an Eclipse Foundation project, the committer must fill out this questionnaire and submit it to the Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) for approval. In addition to the EMO, the relevant PMC must also provide a technical review and approval of the contribution. Follow the link to find out more about what we mean by "significant contribution". Bug fixes or minor enhancements do not require PMC or EMO approval.
"About" Templates:
This provides templates for the "about.html" ("About") files used to describe EPL-licensed content.
Default Copyright and License Notice:
The standard copyright and license notice should appear in all source files where possible. Variations on this notice may be required (for example where a license other than the EPL governs the use of the file).
IP Logs:
An IP Log is a record of the intellectual property contributions to a project. This includes such as a list of all committers, past and present, that have worked on the code and (especially) those who have made contributions to the current code base.
New Committer Process:
The process for project leads and PMC members to add additional committers to an existing project.

, 3)
Development Process
, and 4)
IT Infrastructure
. Full-time staff are associated with each of these areas and work with the greater Eclipse community to assist in meeting the needs of stakeholders.
Intellectual Property (IP) Management
An important aspect of the Eclipse Foundation is the focus on enabling the use of open source technology in commercial software products and services. We consciously promote and encourage software vendors to use Eclipse technology for building their commercial software products and services. This is made possible by the fact that all Eclipse projects are licensed under the
Eclipse Public License (EPL)
, a commercial friendly OSI approved license.
The Eclipse Foundation also undertakes a number of steps to attempt to ensure the pedigree of the intellectual property contained within Eclipse projects. The first step in the due diligence process is trying to ensure that all contributions are made by the rightful copyright holder and under the Eclipse Public License (EPL). All committers are required to sign a
committer agreement
that stipulates all of their contributions are their original work and are being contributed under the EPL. If a committer is sponsored to work on an Eclipse project by a Member organization, then that organization is asked to sign a
Member Committer Agreement
to ensure the intellectual property rights of the organization are contributed under the EPL.
The second step is that the source code related to all contributions which are developed outside of the Eclipse development process is processed through the Eclipse Foundation
IP approval process
. This process includes analyzing selected code contributions to try to ascertain the provenance of the code, and license compatibility with the EPL. Contributions that contain code licensed under licenses not compatible with the EPL are intended to be screened out through this approval process and thus not added to an Eclipse project. The end result is a level of confidence that Eclipse open source projects release technology that can be safely distributed in commercial products.
Ecosystem Development
A unique aspect of the Eclipse community and the role of the Eclipse Foundation is the active marketing and promotion of Eclipse projects and wider Eclipse ecosystem. A healthy vibrant ecosystem that extends beyond the Eclipse open source community to include things like commercial products based on Eclipse, other open source projects using Eclipse, training and services providers, magazines and online portals, books, etc, are all key to the success of the Eclipse community.
To assist in the development of the Eclipse ecosystem, the Eclipse Foundation organizes a number of activities, including co-operative marketing events with Member companies,
community conferences
, online resource catalogs (

), bi-annual Members meetings and other programs to promote the entire Eclipse community.
Development Community Support
The Eclipse community has a well-earned reputation for providing quality software in a reliable and predictable fashion. This is due to the commitment of the committers and organizations contributing to the open source projects. The Eclipse Foundation also provides services and support for the projects to help them achieve these goals.
The Foundation staff help implement the
Eclipse Development Process
. This process assists new project startup and ensures that all Eclipse projects are run in an open, transparent and meritocratic manner. As part of this process, the Foundation organizes member community reviews for projects to ensure consistent interaction between the projects and the broader membership.
The Eclipse community organizes an annual release train that provides a coordinated release of those Eclipse projects which wish to participate. The release train makes it easier for downstream consumers to adopt new releases of the projects because 1) all the projects are available on the same schedule, so you don't have to wait for independent project schedules, and 2) a level of integration testing occurs before the final release to help identify cross-project issues.
IT Infrastructure
The Eclipse Foundation manages the IT infrastructure for the Eclipse open source community, including Git code repositories and code review tools, bug trackers, Jenkins build farm, development-oriented mailing lists and forums, download site and website. The infrastructure is designed to provide reliable and scalable service for the committers developing the Eclipse technology and the consumers who use the technology.
A Unique Model for Open Source Development
The Eclipse Foundation has been established to serve the Eclipse open source projects and the Eclipse community. As an independent not-for-profit corporation, the Foundation and the Eclipse governance model ensures no single entity is able to control the strategy, policies or operations of the Eclipse community.
The Foundation is focused on creating an environment for successful open source projects and to promote the adoption of Eclipse technology in commercial and open source solutions. Through services like IP Due Diligence, annual release trains, development community support, and ecosystem development, the Eclipse model of open source development is a unique and proven model for open source development.

This list is used to discuss the Eclipse Foundation requirements, policies and procedures for access to test and certification kits (TCKs) from the Java Community Process (JCP), the OSGi Alliance and other specification organizations. Most such organizations place a requirement of confidentiality on the use of their TCKs. This list is _not_ to be used to discuss the results of any specific TCK, as that information will be restricted to a specific subset of committers.
