Who is using Paho?
Lots of organizations are using Eclipse Paho for their MQTT client needs. Check out our recent user stories.
If you are using Paho, please tell us your story by sending an email to: paho-success@eclipse.org. Thanks!
The Paho MQTT C Client is a fully featured MQTT client written in ANSI standard C. C was chosen rather than C++ to maximize portability. A
C++ API
over this library is also available in Paho.
In fact there are two C APIs. "Synchronous" and "asynchronous" for which the API calls start with MQTTClient and MQTTAsync respectively. The synchronous API is intended to be simpler and more helpful. To this end, some of the calls will block until the operation has completed, which makes programming easier. In contrast, only one call blocks in the asynchronous API - waitForCompletion. Notifications of results are made by callbacks which makes the API suitable for use in environments where the application is not the main thread of control.

MQTT Conformance/Interoperability Testing
The aim of this project is to create a means by which it is easy to test both MQTT servers and client libraries, to ensure
they conform to the
Eclipse Technology Project
.
This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse community. Please send all feedback to the
Eclipse Proposals
Forum.
Background
We now have the ability to measure, sense and monitor nearly anything in the physical world. Rapid advances in embedded platforms and wireless connectivity are driving growth of M2M (Machine-to-Machine) technology and the many industries it serves. By 2020, the number of connected physical world devices is expected to be in the range of 50 billion, fueled by a 1000x increase in wireless broadband traffic. These factors are forming a significant industry shift that will not be limited to device connectivity.
José Luis Espinosa Aranda, Ph. D., Assistant Researcher
Currently we are working in the Eyes of Things project funded by the
Horizon 2020 program of the EU
. In this project we are using Paho and the MQTT protocol as a way to control and configure the device we are working on. You could read more in this

Embedded MQTT C/C++ Client Libraries
The "full" Paho MQTT C client library was written with Linux and Windows in mind. It assumes the existence of Posix or Windows libraries for networking (sockets), threads and memory allocation. The embedded libraries are intended to have these characteristics:
use very limited resources - pick and choose the components needed
not reliant on any particular libraries for networking, threading or memory management
ANSI standard C for maximum portability, at the lowest level

Using the Eclipse Paho JavaScript Client
Downloading
A zip file containing the full and a minified version the Javascript client can be downloaded from the
MQTT 3.1.1 standard
and hence they can interoperate with each other, with the minimum of misunderstandings.
The test material is all written in Python version 3 (Python 2.x is not sufficient). The component of the test material are:
an MQTT conformance statements spreadsheet, extracted from the standard
a test broker, against which client tests can be run
a test client, for very basic testing of MQTT server 3.1.1 support
a model-based testing package, which will be used to generate the full tests, in due course
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) solutions such as industrial control, smart buildings, asset tracking, traffic control and healthcare monitoring, are an essential and integral part of nearly all industry, enterprise and daily life. Inherent to M2M is the need to connect objects in the physical world, via sensors, actuators and other devices, into monitoring, control, business, and consumer software systems, often over constrained wireless networks. Advances in wireless, embedded, internet and mobile technologies are now creating all manner of new objects that can sense, control and connect. Such smart objects not only create new M2M opportunities, but also expand the availability of device connectivity to Web and Enterprise IT developers. Whether looked at as an Internet of Things or a Smarter Planet, people, systems and objects will increasingly need to communicate and interact with each other in ways that today, cannot yet be entirely anticipated.
While smart objects and physical world systems are often integrated with Enterprise and Web middleware today, it is often done using proprietary integration models and combinations of a prolific number of custom protocols and industry standards.
In most established M2M implementations of connected devices, the data producers and data consumers are programmed to interact in strict and well defined ways. For example, in a smart city, sensor-based systems can alert operators of a broken water main and report the extent of flooding in streets and subways. Well designed open messaging technology would enable solutions well beyond this, allowing public and private transit systems for example, to monitor these critical alerts, adjusting their routes and even notifying commuters and customers of alternative routes, transportation, lodging and meals. Social networks could subscribe, allowing residents and commuters to interact, adapt and even provide feedback and status to the city.

In an example like this, the M2M system monitoring the water main would not, in its original design, have been able to communicate or interact with the traffic systems or residents. The next generation of messaging technology will support an architecture that enables a more spontaneous reuse and rerouting of data with minimal programming or reconfiguration of legacy monitoring systems.
Open source messaging components are needed that can cater to the serendipitous nature of data and events from the physical world around us, accelerating and opening new markets. These components will of course have to support the open messaging models prevalent on the Web. They will have to meet high volume, low latency transaction requirements expected by Enterprise IT. At the same time, they will have to work equally well across the constrained networks and embedded platforms that are inherent to physical world of machine-to-machine systems. This will enable a paradigm shift from legacy point-to-point protocols and the limitations of protocols like SOAP or HTTP into more loosely coupled yet determinable models. It will bridge the SOA, REST, Pub/Sub and other middleware architectures already well understood by Web 2.0 and Enterprise IT shops today, with the embedded and wireless device architectures inherent to M2M.
Scope
The scope of the Paho project is to provide open source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols that support current and emerging requirements of M2M integration with Web and Enterprise middleware and applications. It will include client implementations for use on embedded platforms along with corresponding server support as determined by the community.
In order for M2M device and client developers to integrate, develop and test messaging components end-to-end, Paho will address the development of frameworks and sample code needed to support testing and development of end-to-end device connectivity with a server. The project will make these available in an Eclipse M2M sever “sandbox”, as recommended by the Eclipse M2M Industry Working Group.

Project description:
The Paho project has been created to provide reliable open-source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols aimed at new, existing, and emerging applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT). Paho reflects the inherent physical and cost constraints of device connectivity. Its objectives include effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise middleware and applications.

MQTTPacket
This is the lowest level library, the simplest and smallest, but hardest to use. It simply deals with serialization and deserialization of MQTT packets. Serialization means taking application data and converting it to a form ready for sending across the network. Deserialization means taking the data read from the network and extracting the data.

.
Getting Started
A test or "model" MQTT server is in the package mqtt/broker. You can run it with the command:
and if running successfully, you will see this:
To test an MQTT Client Library, start the test broker, as described above. Run your test suite against this broker. Note the coverage achieved when you stop the broker. Try and get more coverage!
The client_test.py program, as described above, is a good basis for the sort of coverage that ought to be achieved. With client libraries that ensure the data that is sent to the server consists of well-formed MQTT packets, the tests are likely hit the good paths in the broker rather than the exceptions. So you don't need to worry if your exception coverage is low or non-existent.
The Paho project scope includes the development of tooling that will support effective use, integration and testing of the messaging components.
Description
Architectural requirements for network, client and server support will be developed with the Eclipse Machine-to-Machine Industry Working Group and will include, but are not necessarily limited to:
Bi-directional messaging that can handle both signals and commands from devices, as well as supporting the provisioning and configuration of physical world systems. Bi-directional messaging also enables an important characteristic of the next generation of M2M solutions: the ability to configure or move processing closer to the physical world systems as needed, in support of changing business requirements and the constant reshaping of the Web.
Determinable delivery of messages to and from sensors, actuators, and other resource constrained devices connected by intermittent or constrained networks.

Provide loose coupling in highly dynamic system environments where large volumes of physical word events and messages that need to be made available to the Enterprise, Web, and other consumers in ways that may not always be anticipated. This should include time, space and synchronization decoupling that will avoid unnecessarily tight binding between systems.
Constrained platforms: Instrumentation of the physical world must be supported in an extremely fragmented space where technologies, platforms and network choices are driven by very diverse equations of cost, technology and physical constraints.
Why Eclipse?
Eclipse has long had a focus on open tooling, runtimes, frameworks, standards and software architecture. The Eclipse Foundation has initiated an M2M Industry Working Group, recognizing the importance of growing and scaling device connectivity solutions needed to realize new business opportunities and keep markets open. Eclipse has a large and diverse membership, an established industry presence, and a proven track record on technology projects. The industry working group will provide a forum for discussing the broad topics of machine-to-machine communications while the Paho open source project will make implementations of advanced messaging technology readily available to M2M, Web and Enterprise customers, working to improve adoption.
The Paho project will have relationships with Equinox and other Eclipse projects, including the Koneki project and other tooling projects used by embedded, enterprise and Web developers.

In many or most cases, you will want to get the source from Paho and use it directly. For some platforms, there are other ways of getting the client libraries, as outlined below.
Arduino
A prebuilt Arduino port of MQTTClient is available from the
Paho downloads page

org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3
dependency and append
@aar
to the end of the Android Service dependency. E.g.
org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.android.service:1.0.2@aar

Getting Started
The included code below is a very basic sample that connects to a server and publishes a message using the MqttClient synchronous API. More extensive samples demonstrating the use of the Asynchronous API can be found in the
org.eclipse.paho.sample.mqttv3app
directory of the source.

Build from develop branch
In the toolbar along the top, there should be a dropdown menu. Make sure that it contains 'org.eclipse.android.sample' then click the Green 'Run' Triangle. It should now build and launch an Virtual Android Device to run the App. If you have an Android device with developer mode turned on plugged in, you will have the oppertunity to run it directly on that.
If you have any problems, check out the Android Developer Documentation for help:
